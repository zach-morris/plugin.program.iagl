		<emu_comment>Atari ST list.  This is a filtered list, attempting to capture playable games from the TOSEC archive.[CR].The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The ST enjoyed success in gaming due to low cost, fast performance and colorful graphics.[CR]An early real-time 3D role-playing video game, Dungeon Master, was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like Falcon and Flight Simulator II made use of the enhanced graphics found in the ST machines, as did many arcade ports. One game, MIDI Maze, uses the MIDI ports to connect up to 16 machines for interactive networked play. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that had identical graphics and sound were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports. The critically acclaimed game Another World was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with the Polygonal engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animations created on the Amiga (the two games are very similar on both systems).[CR]Developer:  Atari Corporation[CR]Manufacturer:  Atari Corporation[CR]CPU:  Motorola 680x0 @ 8 MHz and higher[CR]Memory:  512 Kibibytes to 4 Mebibytes[CR]Media:  Floppy</emu_comment>

			<plot>'Nam 1965-1975 is a strategy game set during the Vietnam war. The player takes the role of both the President of the United States and the commander-in-chief, and the goal of the game is to prevent the South of Vietnam to fall in the hands of the Vietcong, managing its military resources and preventing the public opinion to reject the war. As President, the player has to manage the military resources, and as Commander in chief they can take direct decisions on the terrain, such as tactics or engaging enemies. The game offers five different scenarios: Khe Sanh, Tet Offensive, 1975 offensive, Nixon and Johnson. The first three are some of the most decisive battles during the conflict, whereas choosing "Nixon" or "Johnson" changes the year (1964 or 1968) in which the player starts playing.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Up to eight players can join this ten-pin bowling simulation game. The players can compete either in the "Open Bowling"-mode or the "League"-mode. Every player can select his indivudal ability level(Kids, Amateur, Pro) so that players with different skills can compete with each other. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Formalities (Amstrad CPC)Before the bowling can begin some formalities have to be completed. First thing is to choose between the "League" or the "Open Bowling" option. Thereafter one has to enter the team names(only in the League-mode), number of players, the names of the players, the abilities(Kids, Amateur, Professional) of the players and the number of games to play.  [CR]The ability levels are described in the manual as follows:KIDS - Designed for children (4-8). Speed of ball is automatically set and the ball will head for straight where it is aimed with no hook.AMATEUR - Beginner's level. Throws are affected by the selected speed setting and amount of hook put on the ball.PROFESSIONAL - Advanced level. Accuracy in using speed/hook indicator is critical. Errors create poor throws. [CR]Aiming your Throw (Atari ST)After this information has been input the screen displyas a bowler which appears at the end of the middle alley and the bowling can start. Now its time for the aiming and this is accomplished by positioning the marker which appears halfway down the alley (the ball crosses the marker as it travels down the alley) and positioning the bowler at the end of the alley.   [CR]Setting speed and hook (Atari ST)When the aiming is done the player can select the strength and curve of the bowl. Therefor a Speed/Hook Indicator appears at the bottom of the screen which is used to control how much pace and swerve/hook the player will put on the ball. It requires timing and concentration to set the desired speed/hook by pressing the fire button while the Speed gauge slides swifty ascending and thereafter the Hook gauge slides swiftly descending.  [CR]Scoreboard (ZX Spectrum)A game consists of 10 frames. An overall scoreboard appears after the players have completed a frame. Otherwise a line score with the last five frames scores of the current bowler appears at the top of the screen. The game supports the common rules of the ten pin bowling scoring system so the player can throw spares(if it takes two shots to knock down all ten pins) and strikes(knocking down all ten pins on your first ball).[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The sequel to 1942, which is still a vertically scrolling shooter, has the player once again fighting over the clouds during the second world war, this time in an intense battle just off the coast of Midway islands.Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.</plot>

			<plot>Based on the board game of the same name, 221 B Baker St. pits up to four players against each other in a race to solve mysteries set in Victorian London.  After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game's manual.  The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together.  Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis.  Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.  Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith.  Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz.  If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.</plot>

			<plot>Sharkey's 3D Pool is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead). The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included.There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.</plot>

			<plot>Claudette the cat has been kidnapped by scientists aiming to use her for experiments. Bob Cat can't allow this, and sets off to save her.[CR]9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. [CR]Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.</plot>

			<plot>Unlike most of Infocom's games, A Mind Forever Voyaging (AMFV), released in 1985, features relatively little of the classic examples of interactive fiction gameplay, notably complex puzzles and quirky humour. The writer and designer, Steve Meretzky, wished instead to create a game which was mainly story-driven in nature, highlighting numerous social and political themes in the process. The strong storyline and serious tone has lent much critical acclaim to the game over the years, despite the fact that at launch, it was not a commercial success. AMFV was also the first Infocom game to feature the advanced "Interactive Fiction Plus" line coding, meaning that greater computational calculations meant greater system requirements.[CR]</plot>

Both are searching an island for an egg which will give them super powers. [CR]This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy,[CR]Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of these to finally win the game.</plot>

			<plot>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.[CR]By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.[CR]There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.[CR]Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</plot>

Familiar mechanics such as precisely timed jumping, avoiding spikes, pouncing atop the heads of enemies are all featured.Gomez in The Addams Family.The Addams Family game follows Gomez Addams, as he searches the Addams' residence (which has been taken over by Gomez's evil lawyer, Tully Alford), for his missing family members. There are several stages in the game accessible through different doors in the main hall each housing an imprisoned member of Gomez's family. To free his family, Gomez must traverse each stage and defeat a boss. There are also hidden doors that can lead to rooms with bonus pickups, or even some that can serve as short cuts. Pickups include: hearts which increase health; a sword that is lost after taking damage; a rapid firing marble like item, a power-up that is also lost after taking damage; and yellow dollar signs, one hundred of which will award the player with an extra life.Once Gomez frees Uncle Fester, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Grandmama, he can then enter the final area of the game to save his wife, Morticia.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Addicta Ball is a Breakout clone with a twist. Players control a paddle to break down a wall of different block by bouncing a ball against them, but instead of removing them to clear a level, players need to make a path for the paddle to pass through. As time goes on, the bricks move lower down the screen so the path needs to be created as long as there is an opportunity. The game is over when the bricks hit the paddle.[CR]There are different kinds of power-ups, weapons, a thruster to move over the screen, and a barrier at the bottom of the screen that prevents the ball from disappearing, but it degrades over time. There are also some vehicles at the bottom of the screen that can be hit. Cooperative games for two players are supported.</plot>

So naturally the player participates with the goal to win the major league (there are overall three with increasing difficulties). The game itself is a bit like indoor soccer with four athletes (armed with guns) and on a smaller playing field with bumpers. A match lasts 120 seconds and there are various power-ups to collect. Each player only takes control over a single athlete. The sportsmen show up on the screen as balls.</plot>

			<plot>Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).[CR]ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.[CR]There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open Delta option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.[CR]You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The player controls Maddog Williams, an adventurer, as he solves quests and explores the lands around him. The game is mostly controlled by text: Inputting commands instructs the main character how to act with the items and people around him.There are some elements of an action game as well: Maddog can combat enemies in sword-fights, find and collect money to purchase certain items and gain "points", which are considered a high score based on successful actions and a mainstay of graphic/text adventure games of the time (such as the King's Quest games.)Like many geographically large games in the floppy disc era, this game came on several discs which often needed to be swapped as Maddog crossed into new territory. It pre-dates the CD-ROM era by several years, so no CD version was ever made.The game is currently free to download on the developers' website.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>The Adventures of Robin Hood</title_clean>
			<plot>In Robin Hood you must perform many heroic deeds to change the public impression of you from "villain" to "hero." To he ultimate aim is to retake your castle, which is captured in the intro sequence. This involves bringing together your band of merry men, and killing the Sheriff and his guards. There are around 6 extra items you can find in the game, most of which aren't essential but make the game a lot easier. The whole interface is similar to Populous: you don't direct Robin directly but with icons which are placed around the screen.[CR]The AI citizens of Sherwood go about their lives as normal, so it's another game that you can spend just watching and wandering through rather than trying to complete.</plot>

			<plot>Raymond Pardon was a gentle man. Maybe too gentle. Due to non-ability to defend himself against the accusation, he has spent last six years in a prison for a hold-up he did not commit. But the things were even worse: in addition to six years of imprisonment he lost his lovely wife, Myl&#232;ne. Who was involved in this affair? To discover the truth, you as Raymond should perform your own investigation in seven European cities: Barcelona, Paris, Cannes, Rome, Amsterdam, Hamburg and London. In turns you'll behave as a gangster or as a journalist. It is up to you to perform the investigation in cold blood despite the lies and hired assassins. Someone must pay!The gameplay flows as adventure in first-person view. You choose the place to visit and examine the objects there. Moving the cursor on the scene, you set its part in focus and may interact with it. Some of the objects may be added to your inventory and used later, some of the persons may share a valuable information with you, some of them may be hostile.The game supports several languages: French, German, English, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.</plot>

			<plot>Afrika Korps is a turn-based wargame which simulates the activities of Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK) in North Africa during 1941-43 years of World War II. The gameplay is shown on a scrolling map which represents Libya and Egypt, by turns. Taking charge of either Allied or Axis forces, players should plan the attack on the enemy. Supplies, flanking forces, artillery support, and back-up should be considered. Controlling the units, players may switch between strategical and more detailed tactical view of the map. The mouse is used to scroll around the map, while the keyboard is used to carry out different functions. Each army has a special code letter and colour to give the player access to them to give orders or just to view their statistics. There are three difficulty levels to choose from.</plot>

			<plot>The game tries to represent the African part of 11th Paris-Dakar rally route, which in the game takes place in Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal in 1988-1989.[CR]Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.[CR]Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:[CR]1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); [CR]2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); [CR]3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); [CR]4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); [CR]5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).[CR]So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.</plot>

			<title_clean>Afterburner</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]After Burner, is an arcade flight sim/shooter, developed by SEGA and first released in 1987 in Japanese Arcades. It was designed by legendary Sega game developer Yu Suzuki. It was ported onto many systems, including Sega's own Sega Master System just a few months after the Arcade launch, but most of them weren't able to match the original Arcade version's visceral speed and graphical/sound quality.It is the first game among a series of franchise sequels such as After Burner II, After Burner III and the 2006 release of After Burner Climax which ran on the then newly developed SEGA Lindbergh arcade hardware. After Burner II was re-released in 2004 for the Playstation 2, in the SEGA AGES 2500 series of budget anniversary re-releases.After Burner Arcade MachineIn After Burner the player controls a F-14 Tomcat, a type of jet, and the object of the game is simply to shoot down other enemy jets while evading their return fire with deft maneuvers. The player-controlled Tomcat is equipped with a machine gun and a small number of missiles as a secondary weapon which replenishes after each completed stage.The original After Burner machine is a rarity, exclusively available in the Japanese Arcades. It was controlled with a simulating flight stick, with buttons that controlled the cannon and missile weapons. Movement such as dropping/gaining altitude and barrelrolling was also perfomed by movements with the flight stick.The arcade version also featured a deluxe cabinet, which rotated according to the player's movements (much like Space Harrier and Galaxy Force). This was featured in the arcade scene of the 1991 hit movie Terminator 2: Judgement Day, where it was being played by a teenage John Connor. [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Air Warrior</title_clean>
			<plot>Air Warrior is an online multiplayer flight simulator. The flight line comes with a stable of 17 WW II era fighters (P-51D Mustang, P-38J Lighting, F4U Corsair, Spitfire MK IX, BF-109F, FW-190, YAK-9D) and bombers (B-17G Flying Fortress, B-25J Mitchell, Junkers JU-88) from 5 nations for your aerial dogfights and bombing missions. Connect via the GEnie network or fly head-2-head against a friend at modem speeds as low as 1200 baud.  If you played via GEnie network, the battles could contain up to 50 people from all over America at the same time.Each plane has unique features in regards to performance, maneuverability, and flight control characteristics. Using the keyboard control help-screen (brought up with the F10 key) during flight helps reduce the learning curve. Chat communication in real-time air battles is limited to keyboard text, which makes quick abbreviated responses a necessity. The game has SVGA graphics of 640x480 256 colors, which allows enhanced cockpit layouts, increased visibility, and realism during off-line training and online aerial warfare. </plot>

			<plot>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:[CR]Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.[CR]2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.[CR]3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s[CR]Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).[CR]Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</plot>

After catching all cats, ALF must find a spacecraft piece and bring it to the garage.Willie Tanner roams the map, seeking ALF. If ALF is caught by Willie, all items currently in the garage are lost. Additionally, a dog catcher roams the neighborhood. If ALF is caught by the dog catcher, Willie will rescue him, but only three times, after which, the game is over.There is a time limit to completing the game's stages - if time lapses, the game is over. If the player collects all spacecraft parts on all stages before the time limit lapses, the player wins, and becomes a member of the "Honorary Melmac Skleen Club".[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Alternate Reality - The City</title_clean>
			<plot>In this old first-person RPG, you are one of many people who have been abducted from earth by aliens and transported to an alternate dimension where you are dumped in a strange, yet familiar city. Your quest is to explore the city, and find the clues that will lead you to your captors and help you get back home. [CR]In addition to standard first-person RPG's of that era, like skills, stats, experience points and a repertoire of shops and places to visit, the game offered moral evaluation of your character, and depending on your actions you would be good or evil, and that affected how the environment reacted to you. Encounters were not necessarily just resolved with combat, but you could also try to trick, charm or bribe opponents, and the storyline was very non-linear, for example allowing you to take a job in order to enhance a particular skill or just to pass away time.[CR]Alternate Reality: The City is the first part of an unfinished series of five planned RPG's.</plot>

			<plot>Annals of Rome begins in 273BC and sets you as a Roman senator, with the ultimate aim of colonizing as much of the known world as possible, and retaining that power against Carthaginians, Vandals,  Parthians, Persians and all the other world forces. You have a strong army at your disposal, and can direct your generals as to which countries they attempt to invade.[CR]The game is turn-based, and these turns operate in phases, beginning with the economic circumstances of population and tax income being decided - it's recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless things become desperate. The game then updates you on the statuses of your generals, and give you the chance to redistribute them to other parts of your kingdom. [CR]Officers may rebel and cause a civil war - fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More serious are attempts to take land from other civilizations, which take place in order and include conflicts between other groups. These, like every element of the game, are accurately historically modeled and variable in time-span as a result.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]The first of  Dynamix's tank-based combat games (followed by     Stellar 7  and     Nova 9 ),  Arcticfox challenges the player to navigate snow fields, crevices, weather, and mud flats while battling an alien force in Antarctica. Reminiscent of     Battlezone , Arcticfox is played entirely through a first-person view, with only a tiny on-screen map to keep the player oriented. The goal of the game is to destroy the aliens' Main Fort, with a variety of sub-objectives that can make the final battle easier. [CR]Weapons and Tactics [CR]The Arcticfox tank is equipped with cannons, guided missiles, and mines (harmful to both the enemy and Arcticfox itself), as well as the unique ability to "dig into" the tundra of the battlefield. While dug in, the player sees only white through the viewport, making situational awareness key. Missiles can still be fired whilst dug in, allowing for surprise attacks.  While the final goal of the game is the destruction / disablement of the Main Fort, there are several other structures that Arcticfox can target. Blowing up the Communications Fort will render enemy scouts unable to report its position, while elimination of the Oxygen Converters slows down the aliens' removal of oxygen from our atmosphere, allowing for more time to complete the mission.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The message used our frequency, but it didn't come from any of our commanders. It couldn't be! After verifying its content, there was no room for doubt: a spaceship of our defense forces of the future had problems, but it had problems in our time. How was that possible?[CR]The ship has been infiltrated by foreign forces and was going to crash in the Arctic zone, which was under enemy control. The question arose immediately -- Could they seize our technology of the future...? It can't be allowed![CR]Our best man must go into the enemy base to reach the rest of the ship and take off. Objective: to obtain our technology of the future. The mission doesn't seem easy. For that reason, it has been entrusted to Derdhal, who had already been victorious in dangerous missions in Army Moves and Navy Moves (with the same gaming style), demonstrating a deep knowledge of all the guerrilla techniques and expertise in handling computer networks.[CR]The U-92 submarine leads you to the enemy base. When you are above the frozen surface of the Arctic, there will be no return. Your first mission will start. Good Luck! You cannot fail.</plot>

			<title_clean>Arkanoid</title_clean>
			<plot>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.[CR]The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.[CR]By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</plot>

Along with improved graphic engine, better sound and music, better hardware support and more levels, Revenge of Doh also features a built-in editor and allows you to create your own level sets![CR]Revenge of Doh continues Arkanoid's plot as follows, directly taken (including typoes) from the game:[CR]A long time period passed and the dimension controlling force Doh has again come back to life. Occupying the huge starship Xorg, it has entered our universe from a different dimension. Mixtec, Arkanoid type spaceship, has lauched the craft Vaus II to make a preemptive attack on Xorg.</plot>

Your goal is rescue Nimue, apprentice to Merdyn, from your evil half-sister Morgause.  [CR]You will battle numerous horrible creatures such as spiders and bats with your axe and avoid deadly traps while attempting to gain access to Morgause's castle. You will also search for 6 runes, which contain spells, that you must find in order to free Nimue. Artura contains 4 maze-like levels that are so complicated that poster sized map of the levels is included with the game.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] Asteroids DeLuxe is the sequel to the Atari game     Asteroids. The premises are essentially identical, as the game involves shooting up asteroids without getting destroyed by shrapnel or enemy ships. It, like predecessor, used vector graphics.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Player shooting at the asteroids.As in  Asteroids, you had to destroy the asteroids floating around you. When you shot them, they would break into small asteroids. After a few shots, they are destroyed.  Added features in  Asteroids DeLuxe are a shield, instead of a teleport system, to try and evade destruction. The shield loses power as objects and lasers impact it. Another added feature is a pod of enemy robots in the shape of an asteroid. When fired at, they break up and charge at you. You destroy them as you would any of the other space ships.[CR]</plot>

That picture represents some molecular structure that you must complete by moving atoms horizontally and vertically. Once you move your atom, it won't stop unless it bumps into something, so you have to use other atoms as blockades to prevent it from going into unwanted areas.

			<plot>B-17 Flying Fortress is a simulation of the legendary heavy bomber of World War II.After customizing one's bomber with nose art and a name, one of several randomly assigned bombing missions into Germany must be flown. The game not only features actual flight simulation, but also crew management. Each of the 10 crew members has ratings for categories like piloting, bombing and gunnery. During a mission, crew members can be reassigned to other posts if needed because of injuries. Each position including the pilot seat, the guns and the bombing sight can of course also be controlled by the player. A historically accurate number of 25 missions must be flown and survived to complete a tour of duty.</plot>

			<plot>This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.[CR]There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</plot>

			<plot>Back to the Future II is a collection of five arcade and puzzle games.Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</plot>

			<title_clean>Back to the Future III</title_clean>
			<plot>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</plot>

			<plot>Game-play consists of arcade style fast and frantic reflex action from the first-person perspective, much akin to Atari's coin-op Battlezone. The game takes place on a seemingly endless flat landscape, littered with obstacles in the form of some pseudo 3D spikes protruding from the ground.  Armadas of hostile UFOs shoot fire balls at you from every direction. Your aiming reticle is in the centre of the display, and is surrounded by circular radar, which is formed by a series of small white dots, within this are numerous red dots which represent the UFO enemies. You are dealt an initial five lives, and you score points for each UFO destroyed. The game features environmental effects, such as day time turning to night, and vice versa.</plot>

You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.[CR]"Bad Company" is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.[CR]Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including "level bosses".You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.[CR]The game extends over four levels (the four Nu-Worlds).</plot>

The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. [CR]You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</plot>

			<plot>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your 8 years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! [CR]You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up 3rd world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction.[CR]The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  This game is very challenging, and will keep you up for hours. Be sure to try playing against a human too... it adds a whole new dimension.</plot>

			<plot>The objective is the same as the original Balance of Power: use your military, covert, and industrial forces to make your country the most prestigious in the world while avoiding nuclear war. However, it is now 1989, and the Communist Block is crumbling...[CR]Chris Crawford, who rarely ever made a sequel to a computer game, was besieged by mail asking him to update his classic from a few years before to reflect the new state of the world. Russia was falling, the Iron Curtain was shattering, and smaller countries were beginning to assert their own regional power with more freedom from the bipolar world of the Cold War.[CR]The result was the 1990 Edition. This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:[CR]1. The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.[CR]18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.[CR]A "Crisis Advisory Board" of four people, who would give you advice during international crises. The nice thing about being a Superpower is that the little countries do whatever you tell them, but you still have to watch out for your main rivals (USSR or the US)!</plot>

			<title_clean>The Ball Game</title_clean>
			<plot>This puzzle game features four players, any number of which can be human or computer, and is viewed from an isometric perspective. The basic gameplay is very similar to Virgin's Spot license. Your aim is to take control of the largest area of the board, which is done by moving your pieces so as for them to be next to pieces of another colour, which will then become your colour. There are three types of move  short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 100 levels, which needn't be played in sequence. The board layouts feature gaps in, which must be incorporated into your strategy, to ensure that you don't leave a space next to a large number of your pieces, which would allow an opponent to swallow them up.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ballistix is a sci-fi future sports game developed by Martin Edmondson for the Amiga in 1989. The player is one of two partially robotic athletes that has to direct a ball into a goal via other balls fired at high speeds from the player's weapon. By hitting the play ball at the right angle with sufficient force, they can be knocked around the table into the opponent's goal. Likewise, the opponent is trying to do the same with the player's goal. The game supports up to two human players.The game was converted to other home computers and the TurboGrafx-16 by Reflections Interactive (now Ubisoft Reflections). The home computer versions were published by Psygnosis (sometimes using their alternate name Psyclapse), while the TG16 version was published by Turbo Technologies and Coconuts Japan, in the US and Japan respectively. Ballistix's cover art was designed by Melvyn Grant, an artist known for heavy metal covers. Along with Derek Riggs, he's responsible for many Iron Maiden album covers featuring Eddie, their mascot. Psygnosis would often bring in artists from other media to create their box art.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The only way to break into a well-stocked bank is to head underground, and smash your way through layer after layer of earth. This makes for a game influenced by Breakout, but with many subtleties of its own.[CR]You have full control over the bat, able to move up and down as well as left and right. The latter can be useful as only part of the bottom of the screen actually results in the ball going out of play - a wall protects much of the floor. There are inbuilt trees which can't be played through, and dynamite sticks which can clear large sections of earthing at a time.</plot>

The goal of the game is to defeat Necron an evil sorcerer and also the brother of Hegor.Barbarian was first developed for the Atari ST and released in 1987, along with the Amiga version. The game was also ported and released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and PC (DOS) in 1988.The box cover artwork was done by popular fantasy artist, Roger Dean. He also designed both the Barbarian and Psygnosis logos.Gameplay[CR]The game is a third person platformer and uses a rather unique control system. Pushing left and right on the joystick moves Hegor. Pressing 'fire' brings up the command menu at the bottom of the screen. Using up and down scrolls through the commands and once a command is highlighted, pressing 'fire' will perform that action. This control system eliminated the need for extra buttons to play. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Not to be confused with Barbarian II: Dungeons of Drax - a game by Palace Software - Barbarian II is a direct sequel to an action/pointnclick hybrid released four years earlier. Developed by Pandamonium Entertainment and published by the legendary Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Ork, Agony), the game continues the tale of Hegor the Barbarian.[CR]After being improperly defeated some years ago, evil lord Necron has been reincarnated by one of his cult followers. Now only Hegor is strong, courageous, and stupid enough to face Necron and his minions.[CR]Unlike the original Barbarian, which was an action game with a bizarre pointnclick control interface, Barbarian II plays just like a typical action/adventure title with a maze-like layout. During his adventures, Hegor will visit many interesting locales like a forest full of thugs, werewolves and spiky pits, a long, long cave, a semi-friendly human city, a dungeon, and finally Necrons temple. All areas are huge, confusing, and full of enemies and traps.</plot>

			<plot>Bargon Attack is one of the less known adventures from Coktel Vision, though it was one of the first that introduced the unique interface that was used in many Coktel games that followed.  It was also one of the first of Coktel's games to use FMV technology in cut-scenes.[CR]The gameplay is a mix of science fiction, cyberpunk and comedy elements. It takes place in the near future when an alien race named Bargon conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. You take a role of the young programmer who decides to put an end to the cruel aliens. You'll travel through 20 or so locations. Each one consists of 1 to 3 screens, similar to other Coktel games.[CR]Along your travels, you'll face dangerous creatures and some strange alien technology. There are some occasions when you can die (though the option to replay the level is always available), plus the game also features several arcade sequences.</plot>

			<title_clean>Batman - The Caped Crusader</title_clean>
			<plot>Batman: the Caped Crusader was unique for its time in both its gameplay and graphical style. In what was essentially a puzzle game, the player controlled Batman trying his best to foil the plans of both The Joker and The Penguin. But instead of punching people in the face and driving the Batmobile at lightning speeds, the game has more in common with the adventure games genre; forcing the player solve puzzles, match objects in the correct locations and solve puzzles which required backtracking to previously visited locations.  The graphical style was based around comic book panels. Enter a new location and the old area you just left didn't disappear, but rather it greyed out and faded into the background. The panels piled on top of each other, the top most being the current location.   One of the indirect failings of Batman: The Caped Crusader was to do with its complexity. Nowhere in the game is it explained what you have to do, or how you can do it. As for most games of the nineteen-eighties, the instructions lie in the accompanying manual. As the game spread on different platforms, the pirated versions appeared on the Commodore 64, Amstrad, and ZX Spectrum. Unfortunately, games of these platforms and era fell victim to rampant piracy, with kids not buying games but getting copies from their friends. Batman: The Caped Crusader was one of thses and as a result, if the player was without a manual - the game became a series of trial and error exchanges as the player had no clue how to proceed in the game without repeatedly pressing keys on their keyboard in the hope of stopping The Joker and Penguin.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Batman - The Movie</title_clean>
			<plot>Based on the 1989-Batman movie. The game consists of five different parts, each resembling well known game types. Part one, the chemical plant: Hunt down Jack Napier who has raided the plant (typical platform action, climb ladders or use "Bat"-rope and shoot at some enemies...). Part two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker in a fight that decides the fate of Gotham city.</plot>

			<plot>Battle Bound is a side scrolling beat 'em up where the player takes control of Calumn the Mighty who after saving Lady Charlotte has to go and conquer the lair of a horrific golem. But to get there he has to move through the graveyard of the beast which is inhabited by barbarous nomads and cross the bridge of fire which is guarded by dragon men. Calumn is equipped with an axe that he can throw at enemies or he can choose to punch them in a melee fight. For smaller enemies such as the crawling slugs a kick is needed. By destroying slugs it's possible to obtain different tokens. Red ones re-energizes, blue ones gives a power up, green ones give invulnerability and yellow ones give extra lives. In addition to all the enemies Calumn also has to avoid drowning in quicksand.</plot>

			<plot>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. [CR]The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. [CR]Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</plot>

As aliens occupied the abandoned earth, The &#8220;Council of the Confederation of Human Kind&#8221; decided to send a ship to Earth to conquer the home planet again.Of course, the player takes control of that Battle Probe and fights his way through 65 levels to expel the aliens by simply killing all of them in this vertical scrolling shoot 'em up game.The player is attacked by shooting and moving aliens, but also must avoid any ground obstacle dropping a shadow carefully, because those will instantly kill the player. During the level the player's ship is consuming fuel, which has to be refilled by flying over &#8220;Fuel&#8221; fields. On the ground there are also often colored eyes found: a blue eye rewards some extra points, a yellow eye rewards an extra life and a green eye releases a random effect. On collecting extras, the game is playing a voice sample telling you which item you collected.</plot>

Everything in the arsenal is limited, even the "skip go"-option which is set to 99. When firing a projectile weapon or throwing a grenade attention must be paid to the wind, both strength and direction matters.</plot>

			<title_clean>Beast Lord</title_clean>
			<plot>Beastlord is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The Lord of Darkness managed to trick the three guardians of the world (a unicorn, a hawk and a beam of light) into imprisonment and now overruns everything with his orc hordes. The player takes the role of a young man, who is called the Beastlord because he can interact with animals, and has to explore three levels with the goal to free the guardians. The levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there are many branches to map out.The interaction with enemies offers no surprises: the player can perform a variety of combat moves in order to beat them up. Disposed enemies leave items behind, mostly food and money. However, the game requires the player to solve various puzzles in order to progress and to talk to the animals and humans found in the levels. Usually certain items need be found and used at the correct spot respectively traded for another item. Those non-fighting actions are initiated through a pop-up menu. The game also features basic magic, a day/night cycle (some actions are only possible at a certain time) and hunger which causes the need for constant fighting in order to keep the steadily decreasing energy bar up.</plot>

			<plot>Brad Zoom takes on the Brain Eaters from the Purple Planet, in this homage to vintage action games, primarily Galaxians. There are 75 levels, accessed via passcodes.[CR]You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen facing upwards, firing at arrangements of aliens. You can move up and down as well as left and right as you shoot them. At set intervals an alien will emerge from the main pack and sweep down towards you. [CR]Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single boss alien. Aliens with green eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious play is more rewarding.</plot>

			<plot>Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.[CR]The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.[CR]The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Beyond the Ice Palace is an action/platformer developed by Elite Systems and released on many of the early computer platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Beyond the Ice Palace is to simply reach the end of each maze-like stage. At the end is a dragon-like boss, defeating which allows the player to progress to the next stage.The hero is able to equip three different projectile weapons: Two types of dagger and a morning star. In true Ghouls n Ghosts fashion, however, he can only pick up one and use it at any given time. The player is also able to call upon "the spirit of the woods": a large, somewhat sinister face that eradicates enemies on the screen but is a very finite resource. The player can also collect gems for points.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though the platformer received middling reviews - it was deemed too difficult by most, even with its generous ten lives - it was universally praised for its atmospheric chiptune music by David Whittaker.[CR]</plot>

Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.</plot>

Here the player can either use the full 3D perspective or a top-down view. After that, the used cue (there are three), the spin and the strength of the shot is chosen by aligning diagrams and sliders. Then the shot is performed and points assigned. Additionally the player can set certain parameters to change the game experience, e.g. ball weight, friction or rebound.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bionic Commando is the predecessor to the famous Nintendo Entertainment System release of the same name. It is not the same game as the NES version, but does feature similar gameplay. The basic storyline involves 1980's Capcom mascot Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson invading an enemy country to assassinate their leader and stop another war before it can start.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Bionic Commando series features the unique gameplay element of the bionic grapple arm which hoists the player to higher platforms and allows them to swing across gaps. Platforming is centered on this core concept so much so that this is one of the few games in this genre that does not allow the player to jump. Every move you make must involve thought on how to travel via the grapple.Super Joe also comes equipped with a gun that can be upgraded with pick-ups dropped from parachutes.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]The arcade version has been re-released as part of the Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1.There is also a PC port of the arcade version that adds an additional level.[CR]</plot>

The joystick is used to control your plane while the fire button fires one of various weapons. To select a weapon you press the space bar. You need also to keep an eye on your fuel gauge which slowly empties the further you progress.Along the way you will see an airfield or an aircraft carrier. Pressing forward and fire on the edge of these will allow you to land on them. Be careful though because the enemy can still hurt you. Here you can buy more weapons and even re-fuel. These items cost you points so make sure you blast every thing in sight to boost your score.As well as the main playing area you can also see your lives, score, damage gauge, fuel gauge and weapon selected.</plot>

			<title_clean>Black Lamp</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Black Lamp is a 1988 game published by Firebird for a number of 8-bit and 16-bit home computers. The player controls Jack the Jester, who is on a quest to bring back all nine of the magical lamps in the kingdom which had been protecting it from harm. Jack must explore the castle environs for eight of these, which are placed randomly each playthrough, while avoiding or eliminating the various respawning monsters. Jack moves slowly, so the player must be wary of where they're going and which platform they're jumping to.The ninth lamp - the titular Black Lamp - is protected by a dragon that Jack must eventually defeat. Doing so, and ensuring all the lamps are safely ensconced in a special display, wins the game.Jack can collect items lying around or left behind after defeating monsters. Food items restore health, sword items increase attack strength, magical instruments eliminate fall damage briefly and jewels provides a short burst of invincibility. The three latter items need to be collected in groups of five before they become effective.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Black Tiger</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]"Long Long ago, three dragons descended from skies above with a rolling thunder and destroyed a kingdom into darkness. From lengthy suffering and darkness of the kingdom came one brave fighter."[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Black Tiger is a single player action-adventure platformer designed &#8211; as most arcade games were &#8211; to extract quarters from the player&#8217;s pocket as rapidly as possible. As such, death and damage to the player&#8217;s limited health comes frequently from traps and surprise attacks from enemies. This is compensated by the vast majority of dangers having static spawn points and audio cues, allowing players to learn placement in the levels through (expensive) experience. Completing the game involves surviving eight stages and defeating the final boss, using as many continues as required.The player has a limited number of lives, separate reservoirs of health and armor, and every stage has a short time limit that can be extended. The player can only attack left and right with a long chained whip, but can do so at any time &#8211; i.e. while jumping or climbing &#8211; and also throws daggers in a 30 degree upward spread. When poisoned, the player turns a shade of purple and daggers no longer appear, weakening attacks significantly.Level DesignThe levels are short and may have briefly branching paths, designated by arrows that are colored when leading to the end of the stage, and desaturated when pointing to a side-path for item collection. Additional side-routes in every level through &#8220;dungeons&#8221; result in bonus points, extra time and zenny. These are clearly identified by a doorway marked "IN" and can only be completed once per level. Losing a life within the dungeon exits the player back to the doorway in the level. At the end of every stage is a mini-boss or dragon boss, and the mini-bosses become regular enemies in later stages.Shops, Items, Inventory and CollectiblesA signature feature of Black Tiger is the stone statues of old men, revived upon touching them. They may offer helpful hints, useless advice, add extra time, extra zenny, or let the player shop. The shop prices vary depending on platform and region in which the game was released, with the Japan releases (Black Dragon) being the most expensive and the UK releases the least costly. Within the shops it is possible to purchase weapon upgrades of stronger blade variants at the end of the whip, armor upgrades in increments of two up to a maximum of eight, chest keys and antidotes; the items never change throughout the game.Vases and locked chests are plentiful in every level. These containers may award points, zenny, extra time, trigger traps or spawn enemies. Chest keys and bottles of poison antidote appear as pickups, as there may not be a store nearby. Chests will only open when holding keys, and poison will not afflict the player when holding antidotes. POW pickups are strategically placed in the levels to clear the screen of most enemies when collected.Special items are also hidden behind breakable sections of walls. These sections can be located by a red puff of smoke - instead of the usual blue - when the player&#8217;s daggers impact on the walls. These items normally take the appearance of sprites seen in other Capcom games, such as barrels, bamboo, and the yashichi. These items award points, free armor upgrades, or 1-Ups.Enemies and TrapsThe variety of enemy design is broken up as the game progresses by color palette changes, which indicate stronger variants. In later levels enemies are far more likely to appear from pots and ambush the player.Falling Boulder - one of the most common, an audio cue warns before a boulder falls down from the top of the screen, sometimes they are visible before being triggeredChest Trap - an audio cue warns before jets of fire erupt in front of the chest and travel either left or rightSpiked/Bottomless Pit - the proof of platformer, poor jumping can result in instant deathRed Gas/Flame Jet - shoots horizontally out of certain walls for a short distance, hazardous when exploring for hidden itemsBlue Gas/Confuse Jet - same as above but also reverses left/right controls temporarily if player has no antidotesSkull Disc ("Spinning Scull") - indestructible spinning &#8220;coins&#8221; that have a small horizontal range of movementMan-Eating Plant - appears from floor at steady intervals, stuns, inflicts poison and damageBlob - very common enemy that can duck under weapon attacks and chase the playerBat - typically spawns in pairs and vulnerable to attack for a few moments before swooping at the playerSnake - coiled and stationary on climbable columnsTiger - sorry, there are no tigersMummy - typically emerge in succession from the background out of caves or other black areas, breathes fire and leapsOrc/Ogre - relentlessly approach the player once spotted or attacked, carries a shield but easily stunned by daggersSkeleton - spawn infinitely on multiple platforms, can jump and throw heads to attack from a distance, always drops 1 zenny coins which can be farmed if there is enough time on the clockFire Demon - stationary but attacks with omnidirectional fireballs that damage for as long as the player is in contact with it, moving fireballs can be blocked by player attacks.Reaper/Warlock - appears in mid-air to attack with fire pillars, turns invisible and teleports when hit, must be attacked numerous times.Stoneface block - after being awoken by proximity, leaps and tries to crush the playerRed Imp - transforms from a floating sphere to a fly rapidly and hurl spearsDragon - the three dragon bosses (red, blue and black) each have distinct attack patterns and are essentially battles of attritionStrategies and TipsWeaponry should always be considered the first investment of zenny, as weapons persist after player death while the level of armor will always reset to 2. There are also free hidden pickups that will raise the armor level.While poisoned, the player will only brandish the chained weapon and not throw the usual spread of 3 daggers. This cuts attack power significantly and enemies will be more difficult to stun and kill.When fighting the first dragon, always crouch to attack when it comes close. This makes the player immune to damage while touching the dragon itself.After returning from a shop screen, any enemies that were previously attacking on screen when the statue was touched will be reset.There is a limited amount of air control immediately after jumping, but not while falling. To reach high platforms, hold up while jumping then immediately move in the direction of the platform to complete the arc.[CR]Distribution and Conversions[CR]While most released ports for Black Tiger have been on various computer systems, it was briefly announced in development for the NES, but was never released.Emulation of Black Tiger outside of MAME manifested in the 1990s with the dedicated emulator Btishger, which became known for excellent playability in all areas except sound accuracy.Atari ST / AmigaThe U.S. Gold published conversion for the Atari ST and Amiga was done by Graham Lilley, with artwork redrawn by Taoman Irmak.Virtual Console ArcadeIn late 2010/early 2011 the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console Arcade in Japan and the U.S., using 60 blocks of Wii memory. Like other VCA games, various graphical, control, and &#8220;dip-switch&#8221; settings can be tweaked as desired. Changing the video settings to 100%/100% with 2 scanlines gives a reasonably faithful appearance to the arcade game.Xbox Live Arcade/PSNIn February 2013, Black Tiger was released on the Xbox Live Arcade store and the Playstation Network as part of the first Capcom Arcade Cabinet pack, alongside 1943 and Avengers.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. [CR]In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corps control.[CR]Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</plot>

			<plot>The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying.

			<plot>The first of Blinky the ghost's three outings, the ghost with the most has to progress through a series of levels and remove the hazards left by ghost-busters (who aren't called Peter, Egon, Winston or Ray for licensing reasons). He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important spells.[CR]The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.</plot>

			<plot>Blood Money is hailed as one of the best side-scrolling shoot-em-ups to be released for the Commodore Amiga. "The claws boss, the claws!"The graphics and sound are superb for the time and the gameplay is fluid, yet frenzied. Since there is no way to save your game, it quickly becomes an addictive and sometimes frustrating game to play. The difficulty ramps up considerably between levels and only the first two worlds are playable from the beginning. Once either of the first two worlds are completed, all 4 worlds are available to plunder. Gameplay of level 1 can be viewed hereGameplay of levels 2-4 can be viewed  hereThe game is segmented into 4 worlds, each navigated by a different vehicle:Metal World &#8211; HelicopterOcean World &#8211; SubmarineIce World &#8211; Jet Pack SuitRed World &#8211; Jet FighterA variety of enemies appeared unique to each level:Metal World &#8211; Glowing Orbs, Turrets, Robot Walkers, Spinning Shurikens, Floating Jaws, Orbiting Spheres, Red Jet Fighters, Triangular Spaceships,  Stationary Missile Launchers, Green Bubbles, Stationary MinesOcean World &#8211; Sea Cucumbers, Diagonal swimming Jellyfish, Vertical swimming Jellyfish, Crabs, Bubbles, Giant Crab ClawsIce World &#8211; Turrets, Dragons, Floating Mines, Ice Spikes, Bouncing Mines, Small Asteroids, Large Asteroids, Jet Fighters, Flack Cannons, Missiles, Sea SerpentsRed World &#8211; Worms, Spitting Plants, Stationary Mines, Spinning Blades, Floating Brains, Fire Serpents, Spinning Heads, Fire Ball ChainsThroughout each world, money is collected for downed enemies which can be spent in equipment stores along the way to power-up your vehicle.

			<plot>Blue Angel 69 combines the idea of Maxit with pictures of sexy female androids. The player takes the role of certain person who is proposed to play this board game with an android. If the player wins, more of the exposed picture of the opponent is displayed. There are ten stages to complete.In the game there is an 8x8 board. Each space in the board contains a point value. The object of the game is to earn as many points as possible by moving a marker to a non empty space to collect how ever many points are in that space. The first player is only able to move the marker horizontally, and the second player can only move the marker vertically. The board contains both negative and positive point values, so ideally you want to take a high, positive point value and force your opponent to take a negative value. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player with the most points wins.</plot>

			<plot>Blue Angels: Formation Flight Squadron is an F/A-18 flight simulator, with a focus on Air Shows. The Blue Angels are the United States' Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, known for tight maneuvers and precision flying. The game attempts to replicate this by offering formation flying, having to react and coordinate with other Blue Angels in the air.The player can practice any maneuver in the simulator: dozens of high, low and flat maneuvers, Diamond 360 passes, left rolls and 4-point rolls or an entire air show for example. Other than practice events, the player can perform an air show or just go for a free flight. In the air, players fly from a 1st person perspective inside the plane or a 3rd person perspective from a chase plane behind the player. Additionally there are 4 different camera views and 3 different gameplay speeds. After the flight, an analysis is displayed of the flight and the player's performance graded.</plot>

			<plot>Blue Max is a World War I fighter plane simulator, where the player may fly fighter planes such as Fokker, Sopwith, Spad, and many other ones. The game allows split screen gaming for two players, cooperatively or competitively, with multiple 3D camera angle features. Missions involve shooting down enemy planes, while others focus on specific targets. The game includes a very unique feature for those who chose to use it: the ability to convert the dogfights to turn-based battles fought on a hexagonal map but still maintaining the 3D view in a frozen window.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Blues Brothers is a 1991 game from Titus Interactive that features the titular brothers on the run from the law. Over the course of six levels the brothers must avoid the police while completing smaller tasks like unmasking a shark in a shopping mall. A two player co-op mode is also available.The game was released on various European and American home computers, and also received NES and Game Boy ports.The Super Nintendo version of The Blues Brothers is actually its sequel, Jukebox Adventure. The SNES version simply left off the subtitle as it was the first (and only) Blues Brothers game for the system. As such, there is no SNES version of this particular game.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]At release the NES version of the game was awarded scores of 6,6,5,5 from Electronic Gaming Monthly. They said, "...the video game does not cut it. Where is the music? Where are the personalities of the characters? What does this game have to do with the movie in any way? Beyond that though, The Blues Brothers is kind of fun. It's pretty simple, but the game play is there".[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Adventure novel protagonist Bob Morane, an agent of the Time Patrol, is transported back in time to a thirteenth century castle. His objective: to save the Holy Shroud - the cloth that collected the body of Christ on its descent from the Cross - from being captured by his arch-nemesis, the Yellow Shadow, who seeks to become pope and pervert the course of history.The game plays similarly to Iznogoud, Sidewalk, and Bob Morane: Jungle 1.  Action takes place on a tiny portion of the screen; exploring a series of static rooms that interconnect in multiple directions, Bob battles a bastion of besiegers - castle guards, mysterious shrouded dudes, and (except for the Amstrad CPC version) humongous, hairy bears. Yes, the Yellow Shadow is not above manipulating omnivorous mammals towards his nefarious ends. Luckily, Bob can search for hidden items and secret passages to further his aims, and should he perish in action, a giant temporal bubble is ready to encase him and bring him back to the starting point.</plot>

			<plot>Bob Morane, hero of the Francophone series of adventure novels and comic books, parachutes into the South American jungle near the ruins of an Inca sanctuary at the foot of the Andes.  Guide Bob through the hostile rainforest and labyrinthine ruins, help him stop his mortal enemy - the Yellow Shadow - from laying his dirty hands on the ancient treasure buried within, and free his friend Bill Ballantine who's being held prisoner on the premises.Much like Iznogoud, Sidewalk and Bob Morane: Chevalerie 1, the action is confined to a small viewport and your hero can traverse the static screens in two dimensions, right to left or front to back.  You'll have to overcome gigantic jungle beasts, enemy agents, and strange mechanical devices that resemble nothing in particular; fortunately, you can keep track of their locations using your "magneto-thermal detector", and fend them off with your trusty knife or with a bundle of dynamite (also useful for clearing away stubborn walls and blockages).</plot>

			<plot>The game Bobo is an cartoon style arcade game.[CR]The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 years.[CR]In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates.[CR]Besides playing all events it is possible to select and play just one event.[CR]Up to six player can play this game by entering their names. They play alternating not simultaneously[CR]Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. To pick things up you have to move the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). Tossing things is done by moving the joystick up (when using the keyboard you have to press cursor key up).[CR]Below you 'll find a brief description of each event:[CR]Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they  start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.[CR]Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.[CR]In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. [CR]The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.[CR]Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires[CR]In the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling around his cell. When all cell mates are fast asleep Bobo himself must go to bed to get some rest himself. The score in this event is based on the time Bobo is actually able to sleep himself.</plot>

			<title_clean>Bombuzal</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bombuzal is a puzzle game originally developed by Image Works for several North American and European home computers such as the Amiga, the Atari ST and the Commodore 64. The goal is to clear each stage of all its bombs by detonating them while also keeping clear of the deadly blasts. The game's original title is a play on the word "bamboozle", meaning to trick, mystify or confound someone.Mirrorsoft's port developed for SNES was released in 1990 under its original title in Japan, but the game was renamed "Ka-blooey" for a 1992 US release. Bombuzal holds the distinction of being the third game to be released on Super Famicom, as well as being the console's first port of a preexisting title.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bombuzal must detonate all the bombs in a single level without dying in order to advance to the next level. The bombs vary in size; however, usually only the smallest variety can be manually detonated by players if they wish to survive the blast. Instead, medium- and large-size bombs must be detonated from a distance via chain reaction. The player can switch between two viewing modes: an isometric view of the field for gameplay, as well as a top-down overview of the entire stage.As stages progress, puzzle solutions become increasingly difficult and often hinge on a single correct course of action, similar to other computer puzzle games like Sokoban or Puzznic. Failure to execute the proper sequence of movements and detonations usually requires restarting a stage, as the player will often end up trapped on tiles with bombs remaining and no escape route. In later levels, hazards such as fragile floors, slippery ice tiles and roving enemies are gradually added.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.[CR]As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</plot>

			<plot>Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to GemX in some ways. You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.</plot>

			<plot>Botics is a Pong variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode. </plot>

Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.</plot>

			<title_clean>Brat</title_clean>
			<plot>In Brat you must guide a baby, Nathan, through levels with features such as dynamite, bridges and holes. You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.[CR]The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.</plot>

			<plot>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.[CR]Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.[CR]A scenario builder is included with the game, making it possible to create your own missions and trade them.</plot>

			<title_clean>Bubble Bobble</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble is an arcade game created by Taito. The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early levelBubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a characterwhales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home VersionsThe home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. GamesRadar ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble is an arcade game created by Taito. The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early levelBubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a characterwhales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home VersionsThe home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. GamesRadar ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show is a collection of six mini games set in the Wild West.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Knife Throwing: In this game the player has to throw knifes at a spinning board and hopefully miss the young lady who is strapped to it. The score in this round depends on the distance from the girl which the knife lands. The closer the knife gets to the assistant girl without hitting her the higher the score. [CR]Trick Shooting / Bottle Shooting: This mini game is reminiscent of Operation Wolf and Cabal. The player has to shoot the enemy targets as they pop up but not shoot young ladies or innocent people in the back or the Sheriff. During the second section of this mini game bottles have to be shot when thrown in the air. [CR]Calf Roping: In the third game the player has to prove his cowboy skills by roping a cattle within the time limit. On horseback a calf has to be followed by moving the joystick up, down, left and right. If close enough the lasso can be slipped over the calf's head by pressing the fire button and the calf can be brought into a halt by pulling back the joystick.[CR]Bronco Riding: It is a necessary skill for any cowboy and that's exactly what the fourth game is. The player has to remain seated on the bucking bronco by pushing the joystick in the direction indicated by arrows which appear on-screen. The score increases the longer the player stays on. [CR]Steer Wrestling: In the fifth game a steer has to be chased and wrestled down. Therefor the player must get on horseback as close as possible to the steer and jump on the steer by pressing the fire button. To overbalance the steer the joystick has to be waggled left and right until it falls to the ground. [CR]Stage Coach Rescue: The last game is all about catching and jumping on to a moving stagecoach to stop a renegade Indian who has captured it and is terrorising the passengers. Wiggling the joystick left and right makes the horse run towards the stage. Moving the joystick up and down allows the player to avoid the suitcases which the Indian throws at him. Once alongside the coach it can be climbed aboard by pressing the fire button. The Indian can now be punched by pushing the joystick up (head punch) or down (stomach punch). Pushing left and right blocks the Indian's punches.[CR]Reviews[CR]MagazineIssuePageSystemRating%ReviewerLanguageASM (Aktueller Software Markt)08+09/198942,43Atari ST10.6 out of 1288Manfred KleimannGermanASM (Aktueller Software Markt)10/198978 Amiga10.6 out of 1288 Manfred KleimannGermanCrash08/198939ZX Spectrum86 out of 10086Mike Dunn, Nick RobertsEnglishST Format09/198970Atari ST83 out of 10083-EnglishThe Games Machine08/1989112, 113Atari ST82 out of 10082 -EnglishCU Amiga-6410/198937Amiga81 out of 10081 Tony DillonEnglishZzap!10/198972Amiga80 out of 10080Paul Rand, Robin HoggEnglishZzap!10/198972C6480 out of 10080Paul Rand,Robin HoggEnglishComputer + Video Games09/198976Atari ST79 out of 10079Gordon HoughtonEnglishMicro Hobby12/198940, 41ZX Spectrum7.8 out of 10 78-SpanishASM (Aktueller Software Markt)11/198977Amstrad CPC9 out of 1275 Bernd ZimmermannGermanAmstrad Cent Pour Cent10/1989111Amstard CPC71 out of 10071 -FrenchASM (Aktueller Software Markt)10/198978 C648.2 out of 12 68Manfred KleimannGermanAmstar &amp; CPC10/1989104, 105Amstrad CPC13 out of 2065 -FrenchThe One08/198970, 71Atari ST64 out of 10064 Brian NesbittEnglishYour Sinclair09/198994ZX Spectrum54 out of 10054 Duncan MacDonaldEnglishCommodore Format01/199150C6453 out of 10053 -EnglishPower Play10/198948Atari ST52 out of 10052 Heinrich LenhardtGermanASM (Aktueller Software Markt)10/198978 PC5.4 out of 12 45Manfred KleimannGerman[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Bug Bash is a horizontally scrolling platform game where you are a ladybug. The location is your home, a garden that overnight has become very untidy. Around you swarms of insects and bugs are flying about mindlessly with no interest in helping you clear up the mess. They have been brain-washed by the Evil Slug. Now you must arm yourself with a insecticide spray gun and begin your quest of restore the garden to it's normal order.[CR]The gameplay is quite simple. You simple pick up the trash and throw it into the trash can. At the same time you should stay clear  of the bugs or insects or you will lose energy which is equivalent to health in this game. The magic mushrooms that are in the game can be shot at to regain energy. There is also other pickups that will come in handy during the game. The game is divided into days and each days ends with a boss fight, i.e. an enormous frog.</plot>

			<title_clean>Buggy Boy</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Buggy Boy (also known as Speed Buggy in the US) is a behind-the-car rally racing game developed by Tatsumi in 1985. The original Arcade cabinet featured a wide, three-screen cockpit setup with a steering wheel, a gas pedal, a break pedal, and a 2-stage gear box. A single-screen upright cabinet version of the game was later released, called Buggy Boy Jr.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player can choose to race one of five courses: North, South, East, West, and the Offroad circuit. Each course has five legs (with the exception of the Offroad circuit, which substitutes legs with laps), all of which the player must reach the checkpoints before time runs out.Throughout each course, there are many obstacles which the player must avoid to maintain their speed. Aside from obstacles are changes in terrain, such as high banks, tunnels, and bridges, which may help or hinder the player's ability to avoid obstacles. Failure to avoid obstacles will result in a crash, which slows the player down significantly, resulting in losing precious time.ScoringPlayers get points for distance travelled, but additional points can be earned by performing several feats:Gates: Players can drive through gates that are spread along the course. Players are awarded 100, 250, or 500 points for passing under a gate, depending on what is marked on the gate's banner. An additional "TIME" gate awards 500 points, but also added two additional seconds to the time extension upon passing a checkpoint.Flags: Players can collect flags of various colors for 30 points.Jumping: Players can jump off the ground by running over logs that are spread across the course for a score multiplier. Any other bonuses collected while in the air are also multiplied. Players should be cautious while jumping, as they cannot steer or change speed while in the air.Driving on two wheels: Players can drive the buggy on its side on two wheels by running over tree stumps or rocks for a score multiplier. Like jumping, bonuses are multiplied while driving on two wheels. Players should be cautious while driving on two wheels; steering improperly will cause the buggy to crash.Soccer Balls: Players may find soccer balls on the course that they "kick" by running over them for extra points. Many of the soccer balls are hidden behind fake obstacles that they run through to collect. "Kicking" a soccer ball awards the player with 2000 points.Upon completing the course, or running out of time, the player is awarded with additional bonuses:Time Bonus: Players are awarded 250 points for every second remaining on the clock upon completing the course.Gate Bonus: Players are awarded 500 points for every gate collected throughout the race.Leg Bonus: Players are awarded points for every leg completed: 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000, and 10000 points, respectively.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Builderland - The Story of Melba</title_clean>
			<plot>The story of this game is quite simple, presented during the intro as a series of short scenes without words. Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation![CR]The premise, the map with the "stages", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous  Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when "boss" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.</plot>

			<plot>Do you like to play darts?  Would you like to have the opportunity to play darts on your computer?  Here is your chance.[CR]This game offers seven scoring styles such as Golf, Cricket, and the normal 501 scoring style.  Choose how you want to score the game and hop right in and play.  Aim your dart with your joystick or keyboard, then let it fly and hope you hit something good![CR]The game automatically scores for you so if you do not know how to score a dart game, you can still play.  Knowing what you should aim for is helpful for getting high scores, however.[CR]The darts games included in this package are:[CR]1. 501[CR]This is the classic darts game where both players start with 501 points. Scores are reduced by the amount each player scores when it's their turn to throw. A leg ends when one player reduces their score to zero by hitting a double. A game is the best of three legs.[CR]Round the Clock[CR]The player must hit each number in turn, starting at one and ending with the bullseye. A game is the best of three legs.[CR]Football[CR]In this timed game, the number of each segment plays no part on this game.[CR]Each player has a designated 'goal' area. Players take it in turns to hit a sequence of beds progressing towards the opponents goal. The winner is the player who has scored the most goals when time is up.[CR]Tennis[CR]The player serving must hit doubles, the player receiving must hit trebles.[CR]A bed is highlighted on the board, this is the 'tennis ball'. The server has two chances to hit their designated bed to 'serve' the ball. If they are in successful the point goes to the receiver. If they are successful the receiver must hit their designated treble bed. This is repeated until a player fails to hit the ball. Scoring is as in tennis. A match consists of the best of three sets.[CR]Golf[CR]Only the numbers one top eighteen are used in this game, representing the eighteen holes on the golf course.[CR]The object is to hit each number three times, hitting a double or a triple counts as two or three respectively, starting at one and working through to eighteen. The winner is the player to complete the game with the fewest darts[CR]Cricket[CR]In this game the players represent the batting and the bowling sides at cricket.[CR]The 'bowler' attempts bowl the batsmen out by hitting the inner or the bullseye, the inner takes out one batsman, the bull takes out two.[CR]Meanwhile the batting player attempts to score as highly as possible, but only points scored over forty count.[CR]The team with the most runs after two innings are the winners.[CR]Snooker[CR]All numbers count in this game, numbers one to fifteen represent the fifteen red balls on the snooker table, while the remaining numbers represent the colors, sixteen being yellow and so on through to twenty being black.[CR]To score, or pot a ball, that ball has to be hit by the player in sequence. The red balls must be hit once and the colored balls four times (doubles and trebles count as two and three hits respectively.) Play follows snooker in that after a red ball is potted a color must be attempted, hitting a ball out of sequence ends a turn and forfeits points etc. The player with the highest score wins.</plot>

			<plot>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. [CR]In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.[CR]The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.  [CR]In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.</plot>

			<title_clean>Cabal</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cabal is an action/shooter game developed by TAD Coporation in 1988 mainly for arcades (it was later ported to various home systems). In the game, the player controls an unnamed military commando as he travels to several enemy bases and attempts to destroy them. Although the gameplay was very similar to other games of this era, it sold well.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main character is an unnamed military commando, viewed from behind. Each level is a different military base, but the objective is usually the same: kill of the opposing forces and destroy the base. The commando begins behind a protective wall that can be destroyed by enemy fire, a la Space Invaders. The player is equipped with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a small supply of grenades, both of which can be supplemented by various powerups that sometimes emerge from destroyed objects. When the level is over, all of the buildings in the level collapse, and the next level begins. The game also features boss fights, although they were the most criticised part of the game due to the fact that when the player dies, they must begin the long, arduous fight all over again. Two players could participate simultaniously in a cooperative mode.[CR]Ports[CR]Cabal was ported to several home systems of the time by TAD Corporation, including the PC, Commodore 64, Amiga, and Atari ST. Rare handled the port to the Nintendo Entertainment System. The ports were of varying quality, with the higher-powered systems obviously getting an experience closest to the arcade game. There is an interesting cheat code in the computer-based versions of the game; by pressing the spacebar, players can automatically skip a level.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Caesar is a strategy game written GFA Basic 3 that takes place during the days of the Roman empire. The game starts in 200 B.C. and you can take control of one of the following states: Bosphorus, Carthage, Macedonia, Persia, Rome or Venetia. The aim of the game is to annihilate the other palyers. But it is not as easy as just to wage war on your enemies, you have to manage your economy, buy and sell food, recruit soldiers for your armies and build ships. [CR]When it's the players turn he/she have three moves; these move can be spent on attacking other provinces, raising armies, building ships or negotiate with other empires. Each turn represents a season, so there is four turns per year. Certain actions are only available in certain seasons, you can for example only fortify a province in the summer. At the end of each round a summary is given; the status of every player is given in a global index, considering countries, capitals, ships, troops, population, gold and corn. The player with the highest[CR]index, shown graphically and in figures, is winning. The index also decides the order of play. To win the game 180 index points, or more than 7 capitals are needed.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1987 by Epyx for a large number of systems, California Games was a collection of minigames based around outdoor activities in non-traditional sports. In most versions of the game, the player chose to compete in individual events or an event series. Unlike Epyx previous games, in which players chose a nationality, players get to choose a sponsor. The Commodore 64, for example, includes Maxx-Out, Costa Del Mar, Kawasaki, Santa Cruz, Ocean Pacific, Casio, Auzzie, Spin Jammer, and Ray-D-O, while the NES release adds publisher Milton Bradley to the roster.As a multi-platform game, the visual fidelity of California Games really depends on the machine that is powering it. In general, the art style was heavily informed by Californian imagery. The footbag event has the Golden Gate Bridge as a backdrop. On other platforms where space was at a premium, events were sacrificed. The Atari Lynx and 2600 releases only included four of the events: BMX, surfing, footbag, and halfpipe.Each event featured a different soundtrack, including some renditions of well known hits. Richard Berry's song "Louie Louie" accompanies the titles, while The Safari's hit "Wipe Out" sounds out during the surfing event.[CR]Events[CR]SurfingSet under a crashing pipeline wave, players gain speed to do aerial tricks and avoid falling off their board. Most versions of the game rate the player on a 10.0 scale, though some give points to the number of rotations in an aerial trick.HalfpipePlayers are given a time limit in which to earn points for rotation and hand plant tricks in a skateboarding half pipe. Not only must they execute these tricks, but they must turn their board in time to descend the ramp and keep momentum into the next trick.Flying DiskThis event requires throwing a frisbee to a partner off the screen. Players time their button presses to a meter to execute angle and speed and, once released, gain control of the offscreen player the catch the flying disk. Points are earned for successful catches.BMXPlayers ride along a dirt track with ramps and obstacles, doing wheelies, flips and spins to earn points. They are also judge on the time it takes to reach the goal, which can be impeded by falling off the bike or crashing.FootbagJuggling a hackysack with feet, head, and body, players must keep the bag from touching the ground while doing fancy moves to earn more points. Players can hit seagulls with the bag for bonus points.Roller SkatingPlayers skate along a path running parallel to the beach, doing tricks and spins while avoiding obstacles on the sidewalk.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]California Games II is the sequel to 1988's hit, California Games, and a part of Epyx's overarching "Games" series, including Summer Games and Winter Games. California Games II was released in 1990 for the Amiga, and later for several other systems, including MS-DOS, Sega Master System, SNES, and Atari ST. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in five different events.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the game's five events.Just like in California Games, there are several events that the player can play through. In California Games II, these five events are hang gliding, jet skiing, body boarding, snowboarding, and skateboarding. The player completes each of the five events sequentially, and then is awarded a point total at the end, depending on the player's performance throughout the events.EventsHang GlidingHang gliding puts the player in control of a hang glider flying over the ocean. The goal in this game is to drop water balloons in three different tubes, each of which yields points, all while avoiding prematurely falling in the water.Jet SkiingIn the jet skiing minigame, the goal is to complete a course as fast as possible. The player is giving buoy guidelines to follow, as well as time-reducing checkpoints and ramps. If the player fails to complete it in time, they are still awarded points, but less so than a fully completed course would yield.Body BoardingIn the bodysurfing event, the player is put in control of a character swimming in the ocean. The goal is to do tricks off of a large wave in order to gain points. Failure to complete tricks, or falling off of the wave results in penalization for the player.SnowboardingSnowboarding starts the player off in the middle of a slope. The goal here is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible, and to hit the ramp at the end of the cliff face. Unlike other games, the player is given several falls before the event is failed completely.SkateboardingHearkening to games such as Skate or Die, the skateboarding minigame puts the player in control of a skater on a half-pipe course, going through tunnels and doing tricks along the way.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Goldrush is a single screen multi-level Lode runner clone. The background story tells us that its the year 3081 and you are a new class III runner. Your first mission is to recover the PosiGold stolen from the Galactic Government on the planet Supre-60. The PosiGold is located on a spaceship where every deck is guarded by a single class II droid. You carry a 4D plastic carrier bag to carry the recovered PosiGold in plus thousands of bombs.Bombs only works on the floor and not on ladders, glass or the guard. After a while the ships computer will restore the damaged floor without any regard for what's in its place. Once a level has been cleared of stolen PosiGold the level exit will be revealed. Droids can be heat seeking or motion seeking (players choice).</plot>

			<plot>Campaign covers some of the most important battles of the Second World War, from Sahara to the Russian campaign, and from the Battle of the Bulge to D-Day. A map editor allowing users to modify existing scenarios or to create new ones is included.You can take involvement at many levels of a battle. You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank, direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from both sides are featured.It's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the "aficionados" of the genre. The game package includes a lot of extras: a thick "Equipment factfinder" manual (170 pages), 2 huge posters, replicas of WW2 postcards and of a newspaper.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cannon Fodder, and its sequel Cannon Fodder 2, are top-down squad-based shooters. They both make use of reflex-based puzzle solving with some later levels requiring a high level of dexterity and good timing to complete.

Each soldier is uniquely-named (some after the developers), standing in contrast to the "fodder" in the game's title.The player is able to split the initial squad of soldiers into smaller groups and switch between the groups. Squads are armed with guns (primary fire) and with a limited number of grenades and rockets to destroy enemy buildings and vehicles.

He discovers that he has been cloned and is transforming into a machine. To prevent this transformation, Captain Blood must search the galaxy to destroy five other clones which contain bodily fluids. The gameplay is from a first person perspective and has music from French electronic composer Jean-Michel Jarre.GameplayThe game uses an icon based alphabet which is used to speak to aliens while traveling the galaxy. The interface is used to gain trust and information as to the location of other planets. The game takes place on Blood's ship, called The Ark. Part of the gameplay involves navigating worlds and traveling to other planets via the co-ordinates obtained from other aliens.As the game progresses, Blood's health decreases and causes the on screen cursor to shake, making the game harder to play. This could be remedied by finding Blood's clones.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Insane genius Austen van Flyswatter has stolen a huge collection of diamonds, and retrieving them involves navigating a succession of fiendishly-designed arrangements of platforms and traps. Does that sound like a job for a retired superhero? Captain Dynamo thinks so, and aims to recapture them for their rightful owner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Captive is a futuristic dungeon-crawling action RPG where the player must escape imprisonment  onboard an alien space station. To achieve this, the player has control of four robots, through a futuristic laptop computer. These robots are stationed on board their spaceship somewhere in the galaxy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The location of the space station where the player is held is unknown to begin with. The only way to locate it is by guiding the robots through ten locations (levels), looking for probes that show the way forward.Each of these levels take place in dungeons on planets. At the beginning of the game, the player is presented with a probe and a map of the current galaxy. This map features hundreds of planets, making it difficult to guess which planets hold a probe. By dropping a probe onto the map, a planet holding the next probe (and, ultimately, the space station) is revealed.Each level has a scientist enemy that looks human but turns into a werewolf when attacked. When defeated, he drops a code that can then be typed into a computer that is located on the level. The computer then dispenses a probe.Once rescued from the prison, the player has the option to continue playing. At that point, the aliens appear and whisk the protagonist and their laptop away to another space station and the whole thing starts again with the difficulty increased. Although there were a large number of pre-defined levels, the game also comes with a random level generator.InterfaceThe top of the screen has monitor screens, one for each robot, plus a 'camera' screen. The use of these screens is covered below under the "Upgrades" section.The left hand side of the screen is used to view the robots' environment from a first-person perspective.The right hand side is dedicated to function buttons related to robot controls, a button for each robot's inventory, and icons for the robots hands (for details see the "Hands" section). There are also icons for instigating "sleep" mode (used for certain time-based tasks), pause, and save game functions.At the bottom of the screen is a remote control button panel, used for activating "Upgrades", although.MovementThe robots' view is displayed in a first-person perspective, and movement is grid-based. The party can only ever face North, South, East, or West. The party can rotate 90 degrees, walk forwards, backwards, and sidestep. DungeonsWith a planet identified by a probe, the player has to land on the planet's surface and search for the dungeon entrance. Whilst on the surface, players would be attacked by dinosaurs. Players would then have to enter a specific code to open the door to the 'dungeon'. At the end of the level, having retrieved the probe for that planet, the player must blow up the base using explosives on the generators. When escaping the exploding dungeon, the player has to quickly escape and enter the door code while being chased by flames.The RobotsEach robot has a color and can be named. Each robot has armour for arms, legs, hands, feet, torso, and head. Improving armor also improves a robot's stats (maximum carrying threshold, resistance to attack, etc). The torso is the most vital item; it powers the robots. Players have to regularly top up the power supply for each robot from power outlets found around each dungeon. Damaged body parts can be repaired by shop keepers. Only depletion of the torso's health deactivates a robot.UpgradesEach robot also has "slots" representing a backpack inventory, and slots for chip upgrades. Using money found on the bodies of enemies, players can make purchases from shopkeepers that inhabit the game's dungeons. These upgrades include things like visors for seeing in the dark, mappers to provide a basic map, and an item that allows robots to walk on ceilings (this can be used to avoid corrosive water and to help hit certain enemies). Where and when appropriate, upgrades are displayed on the monitors across the top of the game view. Use of these upgrades drain the robot's torso power charge.HandsRobots can hold weapons in their hands. These can be bought from shopkeepers, or dropped by defeated enemies (however, these dropped weapons were significantly worse than weapons bought from a shop).Weapons range from throwable balls, to swords, to lasers. Each weapon requires ammo that has to be stored in each robot's inventory. Weapons can also jam, forcing the player to reload, thus wasting ammo. Experience PointsThe use of armor and weapons is limited via an experience points system. Each robot gains experience from performing any and all tasks (even walking into walls). These points can then be spent upgrading the robots' stats. For example, the use of a Magnum VII may have required a handgun stat of 22 out of 24.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Although a platform game with a decidedly cute look, Car-Vup has little in common with others of the time. The clue as to why is in the titular pun - although you don't carve anything up as such.[CR]You're at the controls of a car across a landscape made up of colourless girders, and your task is to drive over each of these in turn, which colours them in. By default, upon reaching the end of each platform you turn around, but you can jump across the gap by pressing fire. There are enemies to avoid contact with; these follow pre-programmed movement paths.</plot>

			<title_clean>The Carl Lewis Challenge</title_clean>
			<plot>The game has a lot of things going for it. The game itself is a lot deeper than the title would suggest in that it is about more than just Carl Lewis. You can select from a variety of countries to enter your athletes from, and then train them to hone their abilities before the real competition begins. The events are varied and range from running the 100 meter dash to the javelin throw. And the selection of athletes is generous with a good selection of both male and female stars.

			<title_clean>Carrier Command</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]It's 2166 and the world is in the midst of an energy crisis. Two advanced Aircraft Carries are sent to colonize sixty-four newly-discovered islands in the Pacific. This mineral rich archipelago is seen as way of alleviating said energy crisis. However, terrorists remotely hack into the system and take control of the newer, fully automated carrier, the ACC Omega. The first carrier built, the ACC Epsilon, is controlled by a single human commander and this lack of automation prevented its takeover. With the Fifteen billion dollar ransom payment out of the question your country (never stated) has no choice but to make the project an aggressive one; you are made captain of the ACC Epsilon and must destroy the ACC Omega. Colonize more islands, get more resources, and ultimately lead the carrier's built-in drone fighters to a full-on assault on the enemy carrier, or cut off its supplies, leaving it stranded. An Extremely Subjective Strategy GuideYou are in command of a futuristic carrier and your task is to capture islands, expand your supply network and ultimately beat the opponent carrier which is aiming to do the same. A simple premise then, but that&#8217;s just the top of the iceberg. There are two play modes &#8211; action and strategy. If you&#8217;re starting the game for the first time, choose the strategy mode as it will allow you to explore the interface. The action mode will throw you straight into the belly of the beast so you need to be familiar with the controls if you are to survive the initial encounter with the enemy island ahead of you. A word of advice, once you feel comfortable with controls and the interface, restart the game before attempting to beat the enemy. This is due to the fact that the enemy carrier will start capturing islands and expanding its network from the second that the game starts, and if you&#8217;re not quick enough (or you think the Pause button is not your friend), you will fall behind to the point where you&#8217;ll be completely cut off. There are couple things you need to be aware of. Firstly, your carrier has onboard defenses that you will have to get familiar with if you wish to survive. The top mounted laser will be your friend against enemy mantas (aircrafts) and long range missiles. Once you feel comfortable you can also start using the flare which will defend you from incoming manta missiles. Finally, there are also drones and long range missiles at your disposal. The real fun begins once you start using your on-board vehicles. You have Mantas (aircraft) and Walruses (amphibious craft) at your disposal when invading enemy islands or attacking the enemy carrier. Both can be equipped with a plethora of missiles, bombs, long range scanners etc. Once you equip a vehicle you can dispatch it and then take control. Controlling them is easy and you&#8217;ll love it, especially flying the manta. Remember to refuel them every time you land back or get one from stock. Getting vehicles into the carrier is a bit tricky. You will have to initiate it from the ship itself once the vehicle is in range (and preferably in autopilot mode). It&#8217;s a bit tricky but you&#8217;ll get a hang of it quickly. Once you have mastered the control of your carrier and onboard vehicles, you&#8217;re ready to go out and start expanding your network of islands. One of the more cryptic parts of the game is restocking the ship with fuel and supplies. To do this, you first have to be aware of the fact that there are three types of islands - defense, resource and factory. The important part is that you can only resupply from an island that is connected to your stockpile island through the network. You can see the overview of resource network on your map view. This will play a key part in your strategy. You have to get it right or you will run out of fuel and the game is essentially over at that point. Also, when attacking islands, be aware they have unlimited amounts of aircraft and missiles, so you will need to get out of range and then launch your attack. You can try to coordinate your attack and defense all at once, but I only recommend this to experienced players. Once you feel your stocks are big enough to challenge the enemy carrier, you can try and defeat it. If you look at the message log, you can approximate its position depending on the island it attacked last. Set the heading toward it and if all goes well, you will win the game![CR]</plot>

			<plot>Castle Master is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. [CR]Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player controls the King of Albion, who seeks to expand his kingdom north and conquer the Celts. With the backing of the Pope, the three most powerful dukes, and a horde of laborers, carpenters and craftsmen, the player must battle the Celts and rule all of Bretagne![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The central gameplay mechanic is the designing, construction and defense of the player's castles. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses either a 1, 3, or 8 castle campaign. Each successive level is more challenging, due to more difficult and frequent attacks, and less-hospitable terrain. The player is provided with an overhead view of the terrain of which he is looking to conquer. He can then choose from several pieces to place, and design his/her castle. These pieces include, towers, walls, gates, and moats. Layout choices will directly affect how well the castle can defend against enemies.After the player has designed his castle, he must go about the business of managing his kingdom via the menus that are available to him/her. The player can alter taxes, hire or dismiss labor, levy military troops and buy food to prepare for a siege. Castle walls must be built one level and one section at a time. Battlements can be designed with defensive elements such as arrow slits and boiling cauldrons of oil.The time of year has an effect on gameplay, as castle construction must halt during the winter, taxes are collected every spring, laborers and military units are hired over time, etc... Other events also rely on the passage of time.Every month, a messenger arrives and brings you news of something that has occurred within the player's kingdom. The player is then given several choices in how to respond to these occurrences, with each choice resulting in a meaningfully different outcome. These choices are presented via a pop-up screen, with an image of the king thinking to himself about the choice at hand.The player will suffer frequent attacks by the Celts, and other adversaries, especially in later levels. When this occurs, the player must place his gathered armies using any number of strategies (hide in the castle with archers on the walls, a large force of ground units at a choke point in the castle, small groups of units working together, etc), and then allow for the combat to play out. Unfinished castle sections are much less effective at keeping the enemy out. Enemy units will arrive from an unknown direction and begin trying to destroy the castle. If the player's castle is destroyed, the game is over.Over time, the labor force of the Kingdom can be seen making progress on the player's castle. Progress is based on the happiness of the players population as well as the makeup of his labor force. Specialists are required to perform many of the building functions (wood workers for scaffolding and gates, stone masons for walls, etc). The player must decide how many resources to devote to workers/walls/moats/etc, resulting in many diverse and interesting gameplay possibilities that have a real impact on the outcome. When work the castle is completed, a larger battle will begin. If the castle survives, the player finishes that level, and moves on to a more difficult castle-building task at a new location.[CR]Graphics[CR]The graphics in Castles are standard 256 color VGA. Individual laborers are given discernible feature (horses, tools etc...) along with accompanying animations. Building progress is shown in functional detail. Several more detailed and realized stills also exist within the game. Castle planning is done from a flat overhead view, while combat, and progress can also be watched from a 3/4th isometric perspective.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Castles features a fairly standard MIDI soundtrack.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The CK23 is a plane that can take off and land like an ordinary plane, but can fly into space and orbit the earth for weeks on end. When it's ready it can swoop back to the earth destroying all in it's path. It's Development site is on a highly guarded mountainous deserted island surrounded by minefields, electric fences and numerous vehicle and foot patrols. The major problem is that it belongs to your enemy. You have been parachuted in (where you land is down to the wind) to enter the heart of the development complex, take the blueprints to the plane and set a time delay detonator  in the nuclear reactor. You have eight hours till sunrise to complete your mission.Armed with your gun and explosives you travel on foot but can take a shuttle between villages to explore the island. Although the residents of the island have been evacuated there is a resistance movement which consists of 17 scientists who each are hiding in buildings on their own. They communicate with computer terminals and have a plan to wreck the development complex. You must search the buildings in each village to find these people who will assist you in your mission. Catch 23 is a 3D game viewed from a 1st person perspective showing the outlines of the buildings. You can use a joystick or keyboard to control your character to move about and complete other tasks.</plot>

			<title_clean>Celica GT Rally</title_clean>
			<plot>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</plot>

			<title_clean>Challenge Golf</title_clean>
			<plot>Challenge Golf is a golf game with four courses (18 holes each). It uses the standard "two-click" control system: a bar represents the power the athlete puts into the shot and a line runs up and down. The player clicks when the line is at the desired place. After that, the same is done again for the snap of the shot. The only exception is when it comes to putting, then the field is shown from a top down view and the player has to choose the direction by choosing one of a few pre-defined positions. The power is determined the usual way.It is important to calculate the wind in, which is also the only thing affected with the three difficulty levels. Other features are a handicap system, 16 clubs (change the parameters of the bars) and a replay system after shots.</plot>

			<title_clean>Championship Manager</title_clean>
			<plot>Championship Manager starts a successful series of football management games, which means that you don't actually control your players during matches, but you're in charge of choosing the starting lineup and tactics. Matches are played out through a running commentary, with the chance to interrupt it to make substitutions or tactical changes. Each player's performance is rated out of 10, and these are among the many statistics stored throughout the game.[CR]The game features all the most important British competitions, and the database 80 league teams (each with complete squads) and 380 non-league and European teams (who you will sometimes play against, but can not purchase their players - buying overseas players is dealt with elsewhere). There are 1500 players featured, each rated on attributes such as passing, tackling and creativity, and with details such as age and nationality also stored, and 650 managers, coaches, scouts and physios.[CR]Between matches you can purchase or sell your players and trim your squad to suit your needs. When you approach a player, and both the club and player are interested, you put in an offer and see if the club accepts it - they may request an increase. The player will have demands for contract length and wage, before a deal can be completed.[CR]The game follows the season by splitting each week into weekday and weekend, each of which may or may not include a match, and after you have done everything you press Done, and the game progresses in time.</plot>

You must be careful not to run off track, or into the other cars, as this causes the car to slow.[CR]Your car has 3 gears, and you push fire while accelerating to go up a gear, and push it while braking to go down (which makes it harder to recover speed after an incident). The circuits are full of hairpins, traffic (not all of it in direct contest with you for position) and hills - rising over those can be precarious. The races are over 4 laps, and each lap's timing is displayed on screen, along with the distance left to complete this lap.</plot>

The Gods Of The Sea also featured the sponsorship of a celebrity at that time: Patrice Martin.</plot>

			<title_clean>The Chaos Engine</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Chaos Engine is a top-down shooter that was initially created for the Commodore Amiga. It was later ported to other platforms, including the PC and SNES.A remake of the game was released on August 29, 2013 for PC, Mac, and Linux. It is currently available for download on Steam and GOG.com.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the game's introduction.A time traveler takes a journey back to Victorian England, bringing fabulous technology. However, his futuristic technology falls into the hands of the evil Baron Fortesque, who retrofits the equipment for his own personal means, thereby creating an alternate timeline. The Baron creates what comes to be known as the "Chaos Engine", a terrifying machine with the potential to alter the matter of time and space. After prolonged use, the machine absorbs the Baron, making him a part of the machine. This turns out to be the last the world would hear of the vile dictator. However, things don't end there, as the ramifications of the machine echo, as it turned humans savage and feral, creating terrifying androids and resurrecting prehistoric beings. The English countryside changes forever. Out of panic, what remains of the government hires the best soldiers of fortune in the world to shut down the Chaos Engine and save humanity.Now, six greedy guns-for-hire, motivated by money, set out to destroy what remains of Fortesque's empire. This is where the game begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The object of the game is to traverse levels while destroying as many enemies as possible. Scattered throughout each level were various one time powerups, special abilities, food, and money, which was used to purchase upgrades every second level. These upgrades include speed, power, and intelligence. Each playable character had specific weapon types, be it The  Scientist's weapon which can pierce through enemies, to Mercenary's fast but weak gatling gun.The game has 4 worlds, each consisting of 4 levels. The worlds are "Forest"; "Workshop"; "Fortesque Mansion"; and "Sewers", where the player faces off against the Baron.After beating the game, it is revealed that the narrator of the plot is, in fact, the Baron, trapped inside the machine until it was to be destroyed.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Brigand"This mercenary is in the business purely for the money. The Baron has stashed away large sums and Brigand is willing to risk his life to find the loot. He has average abilities and begins the mission with a Rifle and Shotburst."Brigand is an average character, the basic jack of all trades. His weapon is powerful when upgraded, and his Shotburst can be useful if used in the right situation. Gentleman"The intelligence and speed of the Gentleman keeps him at the top of his game. While he's not very strong, the Gentleman can avoid a lot of trouble with his quick moves. He starts with a Flame Pistol and mapping abilities."Gentleman is very similar to Brigand, only with a faster movement speed and less damaging regular shots. He has the map, which is useful to navigate through the levels. Thug"The ox-like Thug is a mutant powerhouse who can withstand a big beating and still fight back with a mighty force. His Shotgun fires several small shells and the Molotov weapon that he begins with sends out a circle of flame"Along with Navvie, Thug is one of the 2 "heavy duty" characters. Boasting impressive firepower, they are somewhat limited due to their incredibly slow movement speed. Mercenary"Experience is on the Mercenary's side. This fighter is a veteran of many battles and a good leader. While his abilities are average, Mercenary does make good use of a Gatling Gun and he is an expert with explosives"The Mercenary is a very useful character, and one which is often advised to select as an AI partner, due to his "First Aid" ability, which heals both players instantly to full health. His firepower is sub-par, especially in the later stages, being outclassed by several other characters. Navvie"The strongest fighter of the group got his physical training by building roads and canals. He also had a stint with the army where he learned to make weapons. Navvie begins the mission with a powerful Cannon and Dynamite"Navvie is the most powerful character in-game. Boasting the highest firepower in-game, which also encompasses knockback, he is one of the most powerful characters. However, like Thug, he suffers from painful movement speed. He also boasts "Dynamite" as a special weapon, which clears the entire screen of enemies. Scientist (Preacher in other versions)"The Scientist is the brains of the bunch. He is smart and fast. While his homemade Lightning Gun may not be the toast of the town, the First Aid Kit with which he begins the mission makes him a good member of the team"The Scientist often comes off as the most specialized character. Featuring a weak weapon which can pierce enemies at higher levels, and the fastest run speed in-game, he is a powerful yet difficult character to master. He also has the most powerful special attacks in-game, such as Freeze and First Aid.[CR]Special Items[CR]NameDescriptionShotburstSends a wave of bullets in a 360 degree angle around the character, killing everything in its path. It is limited to the current floor.Molotov CocktailSends a circle of fire at enemies in the direction that it is thrown. Can go up and down levels.BombSends several detonations across the screen in random direction, and kills anything close on detonationDynamiteKills every enemy on screen, save for boss monsters.ShieldMakes both characters invincible for a short time.Land MinePlants a mine that destroys the first enemy to walk over it.AirburstSame as the shotburst, but it fires on the level above. Useful for reaching usually un-hittable enemies.Party PowerThe most powerful item in the game. It increases the player's weapon power and speed to maximum for a short duration.First aidRecovers a large amount of HP to both player characters.MapShows the map.Repel MonsterWhen this blinking light is placed on the floor, monsters will run away from it for a brief time.Distract MonsterAll enemies will rush to attack this special ability, including all missiles fired by the Chaos Engine. Incredibly useful, but situational.Freeze MonsterAll enemies on screen are frozen. Useful to clear out rooms in a short period of time in a safe and efficient manner.[CR]</plot>

The author was not shy about his program's prowess.  Built into the program is a pull-down menu, giving it's performance against Chessmaster 2000, Chessmaster 2100 and Colossus X, in 10 games apiece.[CR]The game was designed to improve as it played, so over time a game that played against good players would be much better than when it first began.  Users have the option of saving, so that the gained intelligence isn't lost.[CR]Although the author clearly wanted the game to be used by serious chess players, he included whimsical chess pieces as well.  One set includes farm animals (sheep pawns, dog rooks, horse knights, chicken bishops, cow queens, and pig kings); Another setting includes Science-Fiction pieces that look like aliens. The game can be played in 2D or 3D, and includes digitised speech on the Amiga version.</plot>

			<plot>Chinese Karate is a one vs. one fighter. Like the title suggests, the fights are restricted to hand-to-hand combat as well as flying kicks. The game consists of a tournament with six fights in which the player, in the role of the combatant with the white robe, battles against an opponent dressed in red. The goal of each fight is to bring the opponent's health bar to zero before the own health runs out. If no fighter manages to KO the enemy after two rounds of 99 seconds, the guy with the most remaining health wins. Each fight takes place in another area with a new background image and progresses in difficulty. Between fights the player gets to engage in a bonus game in which items, e.g. flying balls or vases, have to be destroyed for bonus points.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chip's Challenge is a puzzle game created by Chuck Sommerville, first released on the Atari Lynx in 1988. The game was later ported to Windows, DOS, Amiga, Commodore, and Amstrad systems. The story of the game is about a high-school nerd named Chip McCallahan, who meets Melinda "The Mental Marvel" in a lab. She will allow Chip to join her club The Bit Busters if he manages to navigate through the clubhouse.Chip's Challenge for WindowsThe gameplay of Chip's Challenge is simple. The player must navigate through 144 levels (not including bonus ones) collecting computer chips in order to proceed to the next level. The first 8 levels are lesson levels, designed to help the player understand the challenges present in the game. Chip also has to deal with hazards and puzzles such as locked doors, monsters, trap doors, etc to proceed. Blocks may also be needed to move or used to get further through the levels. Chip can be moved by the mouse button or the arrow keys, and has to collect all the chips to pass the socket and reach the exit square. Not all levels have sockets, so Chip may only need to find his way around the level to reach the exit square. Each level also had a unique password used to save the player's progress through the game, and some hardcore Chip's Challenge players may want to record their high scores and best times to try and improve them.The player community of Chip's Challenge has p. Players can now make their own levels with "ChipEdit", record footage of them playing the game with "ChipCap", and download many custom created levelsets online. Official levelsets, such as the Chip's Challenge Level Pack 2, for example, contains 149 new levels created by players of the community.A sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chip's Challenge 2 was in the developed shortly after release, but copyright issues prevented it from being legally released until May 28, 2015 , when it was released alongside the original on Steam, Both games, along with a level editor, are available in a bundle for $5, or individually.A spiritual successor. Chuck's Challenge 3D was released in 2013. The Chuck in the title is the designer of Chip's Challenge.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Chrono Quest II</title_clean>
			<plot>This is a sequel to Chrono Quest, part of a series of games called Explora in their original French releases. After the events of the first game, you attempt to return to France of 1922, your own time period. A disorder on Explora, your time-machine, makes it use up all its metal fuel, leaving you stranded on an unknown time era. You need to find enough metal for Explora to be able to return you to your place in time. [CR]The original point-and-click interface (text-based with auxiliary icons) was replaced by a fully icon driven one. There's a row of icons at the bottom of the screen with movement arrows, a save game icon, "get", "give", "examine", etc. The conversations with characters have a basic form of speech-synthesis which can be turned off (the full text of the dialogue is displayed either way). The game boasts 13 different locations and multiple time stages.</plot>

			<title_clean>Chuck Rock</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In this racing game, the players get to race in police cars instead of the usual racing cars driven by speed freaks (like in the Crazy Cars series). Break the law instead of upholding it, while racing through the streets of San Francisco (Cisco for short, hence the name). Take in the Golden gate Bridge, China Town and the Twin Peaks.Avoid collisions with trams, other cars (driven by annoying citizens), buildings and road blockades etc., while trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out!  Use your horn to alert other road-users of your presence.</plot>

			<title_clean>Civilization</title_clean>
			<plot>Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism. </plot>

			<plot>Clogged up is a moving puzzle game. On a 6x6 board your goal is to reach the exit with your clog shoe. It can only left and right and the way is blocked by many different stones in different lengths (2-4). All those stones can only be moved in the direction of their orientation, so some can moved up and down, others left and right (in later levels there are blocks movable in all directions). You have to move the stones until the way is free for your clog to move to the exit.There are six worlds with several levels to unlock, starting with a Dutch theme and an Atari theme in world two. Each level solved is saved so you do not have to play it again. There are no points, but "loscores", which are the amount of moves required until the level is finished. Also, if you only use the minimum account of moves possible, the score is marked as "perfect". For each level solved you get additional help calls, which can be used if you are stuck. In a two-player multi-player mode two identical boards are displayed beside each other and the players simultaneously try to make the position as difficult as possible. After a given time the boards are swapped and each player has to solve the position the other player set up. The faster player wins the round.There are high-score tables (or "loscore" table in this game), which are saved to disk.</plot>

			<plot>Dominique, that careless girl, has been kidnapped again, and naturally it is up to Cobra and his mechanical mate, Lady, to rescue her.[CR]Cobra II plays almost exactly as the previous game, only with new level layouts and slightly more rich gameplay. The isometric playfield is the same, and even the border decorations are the same. You control both Cobra and Lady, though optionally a second player may take control of Lady. You still shoot anything that moves, and have a stockpile of smart bombs to destroy anything that you failed to shoot. A star moves around the corners of the screen; follow it to find the exit to the next level. A new feature is that sessions can be saved and loaded at any point.</plot>

			<title_clean>Codename Iceman</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Codename: ICEMAN is a graphic adventure/submarine simulator released by Sierra in 1989. It was written and designed by Jim Walls, who also created the Police Quest franchise. Similar to many of Sierra&#8217;s adventure titles at the time, Codename: ICEMAN employs a text interface, asking the player to type in whatever directions they want the protagonist, Lt. Commander Johnny Westland, to follow. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Lt. Commander Westland is enjoying a vacation in Tahiti when the U.S. Ambassador to &#8220;the Middle East&#8221; is kidnapped. Oil has been discovered in Tunisia, and it&#8217;s believed the Ambassador&#8217;s abduction is a plot by Russian agents to hurt U.S. relations within the region. Westland hitches a ride on a submarine to the area, but after the Captain of the sub is incapacitated, circumstances lead to Westland taking control. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Codename: ICEMAN&#8217;s interface is operated in a typical method for adventure games of that time period. In order to interact with the environment, commands such as 'open drawer' and 'look in pockets' are needed. However, ICEMAN&#8217;s interface is slightly more technically advanced than some of its contemporaries, in that Westland&#8217;s position on the screen has a contextual impact on the responses the player receives. For example, if players simply type 'look', they will receive a description of whatever Westland is facing without having to know what the object he&#8217;s looking at is beforehand.A large portion of the middle of the game is taken up by a submarine simulator. As most of the submarine panel is unlabelled and unexplained, it&#8217;s necessary to have the game&#8217;s manual handy to refer to during play. While most of the simulator is practicing changing speed and depth, there are battles with other ships as well. Many factors must be considered during battles, such as different types of sonar, temperature inversion layers, proper use of &#8220;Silent Running&#8221;, etc. [CR]Copy Protection[CR]There are vast amounts of copy protection present in Codename: ICEMAN. Information in the manual is required for many parts of the game. These include: performing CPR, following the proper method of requesting to board a Naval vessel, decrypting messages from Washington, plotting an efficient course for the submarine, handling the submarine controls, and surviving a Naval battle.[CR]Dead Ends[CR]There are numerous ways to become irrevocably stuck. One example is players turning in their ID card to a guard in order to enter a meeting. After the meeting ends, players must not only remember to ask the guard for their ID back, but they must also think to read their ID card in the guard&#8217;s presence to notice that they received the wrong card. If this isn't done at that precise time, players will not be able to progress further in the game past a certain point. This is only one of several scenarios where restoring to an earlier game (if available) would be necessary. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>This racing game has novelty value if nothing else - instead of the more conventional vehicles, it sets you riding a sidecar in a game with realistic and arcade elements. The circuits are based on real ones, although the opposition (of which there are 9) are known simply by first names such as David and Paul.[CR]The display appears to use real 3D, with some fairly terrifying directional changes, although it doesn't tilt as you turn. A full map of your position relative to your rivals is presented at the top of the screen. Crashes cause gradual engine damage, reducing your initial 140mph top speed by a slight amount each time - you'll also lose time as you rejoin. Before each race you must set a qualifying lap, which allows you multiple attempts.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Outnumbered and outgunned, the player controls commando Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson. His job is to blast his way through levels filled with paramilitary scum and save the hostages, using only a few grenades and his trusty rifle. Some will run at Joe, guns blazing, while others will be smart enough to hide from him. The maps are varied with trees, rivers, and bridges, and grenades can be found scattered around the map.Beating the main sequence will loop the game back around to the beginning in the style of the classic Arcade.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The NES version of Commando contains several secret rooms that weren't found in the Arcade original. It was the first Capcom NES conversion that they themselves performed, rather than giving it to developers-for-hire Micronics to handle as had been the case with their previous NES games. As such, the NES version of Commando might be seen as Capcom's first foray into console game development.The Atari 7800 version was produced by Sculptured Software under license from Data East USA. It contains weapon power-ups, such as a rapid-fire rifle.The Commodore 64 version features different music by Rob Hubbard. The C64 music was later referenced in a track on the Bionic Commando Rearmed soundtrack. A hacker group known as DSE produced a bootleg sequel (which they called "Commando: The Second Version") by hacking new levels into the game. [CR]</plot>

While you can access some menus as the bottom of the screen you can see the map on the main part of the screen where each unit is indicated as small square. Your aim, of course, is to eliminate all the enemy units.[CR]Some special actions can be selected, like deploying special units, attack with chemical weapons or even nuclear ones.</plot>

			<title_clean>Conquests of Camelot</title_clean>
			<plot>It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land.Conquests of Camelot is an adventure game that requires the player to input text commands, mostly by combining verbs and objects (such as "look man", "take purse", etc.). A few commands (such as "ask about") have keyboard shortcuts. Unlike most other adventures, the game does not focus extensively on inventory-based puzzles. Rather, it presents a diverse array of tasks depending on concrete situations. These involve exploration, solving riddles, gathering information, participating in arcade sequences such as jousting, and others. Rudimentary money management is present as well. Many problems have different solutions, and it is possible to reach the final part of the game even without having completed some of the essential quests (e.g. failing to save the knights). However, Arthur is being judged by the game in three different categories: skill (referring to the action sequences), wisdom (evaluating the amount of cultural information gathered), and soul (determining the moral value of Arthur's action). Failure to achieve a high score in the last category leads to a bad ending.The game is set in a concrete historical period, but adds an alternate reality to it, assuming that pagan deities really existed, but were overshadowed by Christian worship. However, there are only a few references to real religious practices of the time or any historical characters.</plot>

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.[CR]The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</plot>

			<plot>Cool Croc Twins is a platform game where, as one of the cool crocodile twins Punk and Funk, you try to reach the beautiful crocodile girl. [CR]To do so, you'll have to complete over 60 levels. Each level is made of a bunch of thin, floating platforms. When you approach the edge of a platform, you do not fall off - rather, you begin walking upside-down on the other side! Instead of jumping, you "reverse the gravity" of your croc, causing him to fall up or down until he lands on a platform. [CR]You goal on each level is to light up all the bulbs by bumping them with your head. If you hit the bulb three times it will be completely lit up. Some bulbs are invisible on higher levels. There are also foes who want to stop you and who sabotage your efforts by bumping into the bulbs you've lit, turning them off. Your foes can walk on both sides of the platforms just as you and can jump from platform to platform just as you, so watch out! [CR]The game can be played by 2 players, so if you are Funk then your friend is Punk and you can challenge each other in scores.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cool World is a platformer/adventure game based on the movie of the same name. The player must navigate Cool World as either cop Frank Harris or cartoonist Jack Deebs (played by Brad Pitt and Gabriel Byrne respectively in the movie), depending on the version, and prevent Holli Would from passing over to the real world.The game was released on many platforms between 1992-93, around the time the movie was released. Like most licensed movie tie-in games of the era, it was not well received critically.Super Nintendo VersionIn the Super Nintendo version the player assumes the role of Jack Deebs and is trying to find a way to escape Cool World and return to the real world. A large part of the gameplay involves solving adventure game puzzles and avoiding the "Popper Police" for as long as possible. If the player collects enough coins, they can pay the fine and keep playing.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In Cosmic Pirate the player takes the role of a criminal who works for The Council, a space pirate organization. It offers several missions to the player, all with the goal to hijack a space truck. During the course of the game the player will undertake increasingly more dangerous and difficult missions.This game is a multi-directional shooter. For each mission the player gets transported to the estimated destination of the truck. However, the correct space sector has to be found first through the means of elimination. The player uses warp beacons to go to the next sector and when the correct one is found, the radar shows the way to the truck. However, every usage of a beacon costs money which is earned by shooting alien ships in the current sector, which can be freely explored in all directions. Every killed enemy gives credits and probably leaves an extra behind which gives advantages if picked up, e.g. bonus credits, a protection shield or a smart bomb. Money left after finishing a mission can be reinvested into ship upgrades.</plot>

			<plot>In the game you play a role of the special agent Cougar. Your mission is to penetrate the criminal's fortress to retrieve an information on new drug. The game is divided on three parts of different styles.[CR]First one is side-scrolling action in different locations such as prison, mines, or temple. For example, you begin in the prison, from where you must escape finding the keys to open doors, fighting the guards with martial arts, avoiding the grenades and lethal obstacles, acquiring the gun, and finally jumping into the plane. [CR]Second one is a flight simulator. For example, you have to control a plane, flying over the territory and shooting enemy planes with gun or missiles.[CR]Third one is a motorcycle riding. You have to reach the checkpoint for 3:00 before blowing up.</plot>

			<plot>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.[CR]You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</plot>

This takes in several parts of the USA, in several powerful cars. Initially you have a Porsche 911 Turbo in your hands, but this can later be upgraded to a Lamborghini and then a Ferrari. There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers. Each race must be completed within the time limit.</plot>

			<plot>The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name.  Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it "The Hippest Place in The KnownUniverse".  Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers.  The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes.  He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages.  The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis.  At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.The final stage on each level is a torture chamber, which takes place on a single screen.  Here Clyde must stop one of his friends being killed by the demons, who are using some sort of ACME device.  This is a puzzle game stage, where you must use the items in the room to kill one of the demons threatening Clyde's friend.  Clues can also be bought from the witch.  Whatever the outcome, either death will be gory, although the cartoony graphics of the game means that things aren't really graphic.</plot>

			<plot>Crime City is a classical point-and-click adventure. You play Mr. White, a poor chap who writes detective stories but wants nothing more than to be a real private investigator. It's a pretty classical story: one day, he can't really write a thing, but then, a mysterious blonde stands before his door, telling him his Father, Henry White, was arrested for murder. It's up to you to prove the police wrong.[CR]A difference to the classical adventure exists: you need money to travel, get information or training. To get money, you can trade at the stock market. What's also different is that the time of the day really matters and that the protagonist becomes sleepy after staying up too long.</plot>

			<plot>Crown is a jump and run game. The goal is to travel trough six different countries to finally become king. The game is non-linear, so the player can choose which country he wants to go to. [CR]The levels are pretty different: in England, you need to control a knight on his horse. You need to jump over all hurdles and collect all 80 shields to complete the level. In Scandinavia, you control a Viking on his boat. Here you need to collect treasure chests and avoid the whales crossing your way. In Russia, you play a Russian bear who needs to imitate the dance of a girl next to him. If he succeeds, the bystanders will give him money. In Japan, you control a small dragon which needs to jump from island to island. On his way, he needs to collect 80% of the stuff floating around or he will starve to death. In India, the small Indian boy needs to walk over the bridge, avoiding the flying bananas (?) and catch 8 mice. And finally, in Arabia, you control a dude on a flying carpet who needs to catch at least 50% of the flying lamps to stay on his carpet.</plot>

			<title_clean>Cruise for a Corpse</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cruise for a Corpse is a point and click adventure game developed by Delphine Software for home computers. It is a dialog-driven murder mystery, where the player controls Raoul Dusentier, a French police inspector invited on a private cruise by a wealthy businessman, only to find his host murdered upon arrival.The third and final of Delphine's adventure games, it featured many interface improvements over its predecessors, and also scenes with the detailed polygonal animation that the company became known for.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Raoul Dusentier, a police inspector in 1920s Paris, receives an invitation to attend a private cruise, hosted by wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan aboard his newly restored ship. Grabbing a chance at a vacation, Raoul readily accepts, and is ferried onto the vessel.He is immediately met by Hector, Karaboudjan's butler, who informs him that something terrible has happened to his master. Following Hector to Karaboudjan's office, he finds the businessman's body dead on the floor. But before he has an opportunity to investigate, the two are ambushed and knocked out. When they wake up again, a whole night has passed and the ship is now well out on the ocean. Even worse - the body has disappeared.With little to go on, Raoul now has a day to solve the mystery and finger the murderer, before the ship returns to the port.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Cruise for a Corpse is a mouse controlled point and click adventure. Based on the second version of Delphine's Cinematique engine, it featured an improved and streamlined interface, with a contextual menu of the available actions on the left mouse button, and the inventory on the right one.The goal of the game is to gather evidence as to the identity and motive of the murderer. While there are some regular adventure game puzzles in the game, Raoul's investigation is mainly done through dialog, where his knowledge is represented by a series of keywords he can pick from during conversations. Asking the right person about the right subject will gain him new information, unlocking another keyword. Additional keywords can also be gained by gathering physical clues or witnessing certain events.Progression through the game is symbolized with time, which will advance 10-45 minutes whenever Raoul discovers something of significance. The passing of time also causes changes in the game world, as characters will move around the ship and certain events or areas will only be available at specific times.When the clock reaches 6:30 PM, the captain will announce that the ship is about to land, and the inspector gathers the suspects to present his evidence. The player is then given choice of who to accuse, and a good or bad ending will play depending on whether the correct person was picked.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Raoul Dusentier - A French police inspector, and the protagonist of the story.Tom Logan - Karaboudjan's solicitor. Confident and ambitious, he may not be content with simply taking care of other's business.Rose Logan - Tom's wife. She puts on a happy face, but some say their marriage is doing poorly.Rebecca Karaboudjan - Karaboudjan's wife. A cold socialite, some think she's having an affair.Daphne Karaboudjan - Karaboudjan's daughter. Young and rebellious, she did not take well to her father arranging her betrothal.Julio Esperenza - Daphne's fianc&#233;. A playboy from a rich Spanish family.Father Fabiani - A priest and friend of the family. There are murmurings he's being investigated by the church for inappropriate behavior.Suzanne Plum - A friend of Fabiani's. A fearless woman of integrity, or a loudmouth lush depending on who you ask.Dick Schmock - A recent addition to the family. Nobody seems to want to say much about him.Hector - Karaboudjan's butler. Unflinchingly loyal, but there may be things in his past he'd rather not discuss.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Crystal Castles</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Crystal Castles is an arcade game released in 1983 where the player controls "Bentley Bear" who must collect gems while avoiding enemies. The arcade version is controlled using a trackball, and takes its name from the castles the player inhabits in order to obtain the "Crystals" or "Gems". It is one of the firstarcade games to feature a definitive ending, as apposed to continuing until a loss of lives. The game was both published and developed by Atari Inc.The Atari 5200 version of the game, as a casualty of the video game crash of the 1980s, was developed but never released. A working prototype of the game is actively traded between Atari enthusiasts.[CR]Easter Eggs[CR]Moving into the southeast corner of the first level and jumping at least 100 times causes the word Atari to appear in level 1-2On level 5&#8210;4, killing Berthilda and going to the corner of the area where she was and jumping, causes "FXL" to appear in the southeast corner of the screen. These are the initials of the programmer Franz X. Lanzinger (who later moved on to work at Tengen).[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>The Curse of Ra</title_clean>
			<plot>The Curse of RA is a puzzle game where the player (Scarab) has to escape a pyramid by solving the riddles. The player needs to remove all stones on a board by finding a counterpart. Only two stones with the same symbol can be removed at a time and they have to be on a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The game starts with Scarab on an ankh and that item has to be returned upon completion. Moving a stone is done by sitting on one and moving it towards the counterpart. Not all stones can be moved however and there are teleporters, obstructions and diversions to make it more difficult. There are also traps and for instance ice that forces Scarab to move in a single direction. When the stones are aligned, pressing fire matches them and they disappear.The game can be played in a Logic or in an Arcade mode. Logic mode offers 100 levels with no time limit. Special stones can make the player&#8217;s life easier or harder. In Arcade mode the player has to complete a level within a certain amount of time. Special coins can be used to buy extras after each level, such as ability to fly for 30 seconds, more time, extra lives and others. Levels are generated at random. The Arcade mode has a high score table. Demo mode shows the usage of all the different stones found in the game. This is a sort of non-playable tutorial. The game also provides a level editor.</plot>

			<plot>Originally released in 1990 (and ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992), Corporation was one of the earliest first person shooters. Unlike most later games in the genre (which Wolfenstein 3-D popularized two years later), you didn't aim at the center of the screen, but with your mouse cursor which you could move freely across the screen (while controlling the character's movement with a joystick). System Shock would use a similar targeting model in 1994.Apart from the shooting, the game has some rudimentary RPG mechanics, including character stats (you get to choose between four characters at the beginning of the game, with varying base stats) which can be enhanced with cybernetic implants, as well as an weight based inventory system. At the beginning of the game, and at various points over the campaign, you get a budget to buy your equipment, which you assign to inventory slots on the character's body.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>After its time as a hit in the arcades, Cyberball was ported to the home consoles, with the Genesis translation being the closest to its arcade predecessor.In Cyberball, you control a 7 robot football team. The robots are of different sizes and different talents (smaller robots are faster but can take less punishment, for example). As robots are hit, they emit smoke before eventually exploding and fumbling the ball, which makes over-utilization of your best player not the best idea.Rather than downs, the teams must move an explosive ball past the 50-yard line as it goes from cool to warm to hot to critical before exploding and destroying the character who has the ball at that point. The list of available plays is small, with the defense only getting to choose how deep their coverage is and the offense getting a limited selection of pass, run, or option plays.The Japanese Mega Drive version of the game supported the Sega Meganet service for online play.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Cybercon III</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The world has fallen in to total chaos because of the Cybercon III computer system. Designed to coordinate the defense systems of many nations, the autonomous computer has unleashed nuclear warheads and robotic weaponry against all of humanity. Extinction is not far away as the last remaining pockets of human resistance are remorselessly fought by the machines.However, a chance discovery has revealed the location of Cybercon's central Brain Stem, and with it a hidden back door into the defense complex which protects it. Donning a powered maintenance exoskeleton, you must penetrate the complex, destroy or avoid the robotic guardians, and discover the hidden key codes which allow access to the Brain Stem.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Cybercon III is presented as a first-person full 3D polygonal environment, albeit a flat-shaded (untextured) one, and was one of the earliest games to feature such. The player has freedom to explore the whole complex, must navigate through many rooms, across narrow ledges and deep canyons, and through disorientating mazes.The ultimate aim of the game is to locate the sonic key codes that unlock access to the central Brain Stem of Cybercon, and then destroy it. The player starts with a set of sonic keys (presented as color/shape combinations) which allow access to various piece of equipment (for example doors, elevators and retractable bridges) throughout the complex. New key codes can be found and allow access to more equipment and new regions.A major game system is the player's powered armor, which has a number of primary and secondary systems which may be independently enabled and disabled. Up to four energy banks provide power, some of which may be self-charging fusion batteries. The level of available power and the number of enabled systems affect the performance of the systems, so for instance the player may choose to jump higher via the power-assisted movement system by disabling the weapons and shields, or fire more powerful shots by disabling all but the weapon system. Other systems include the sonic key, self-repair, and energy transfer systems.Roaming the complex are a number of (polygonally rendered) robots, including tanks, giant wheels, and "angel droids", some of which can be much larger than the player. Damaging the robots without fully destroying them can cause them to drop useful items, such as extra energy batteries, power storage spheres, and other upgrades. Other items which can be found in the complex include a bazooka weapon, and cameras that can be placed and remotely viewed on the HUD, including the remotely pilotable "parrotcam" which is useful for scouting areas safely.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot 'em up. In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships.Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all aliens on each screen act in the same way.</plot>

			<title_clean>D-Day</title_clean>
			<plot>This multi-genre game represents famous historical events of World War II called D-Day and related to operation "Overlord", when Allies attack Axis massively in France.[CR]The game proposes to be a general in command of Allies group and optionally perform certain actions by yourself also. Such actions include:[CR]1. Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; [CR]2. Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; [CR]3. Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; [CR]4. Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village.[CR]All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.[CR]Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.</plot>

			<title_clean>D-Generation</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]D/Generation's In-Game TitleDesigned and created by Robert Cook, D/Generation is an isometric action-adventure puzzle game that was released by Mindscape in 1991 for the DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST platforms, and was later ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1993. Set in the year 2021, D/Generation takes place in a futuristic setting with elements of cyberpunk and dystopian fiction, and the story follows the actions of a simple courier making an urgent delivery who finds himself entangled in the illicit corporate world of bioweapon research gone horribly awry. With the courier as their player character, players must climb ten floors of the Genoq Biolabs research building in search of the scientist Jean-Paul Derrida, the recipient of the package they carry. Malfunctioning security systems and hostile organic weapons (called Neogens) will impede their progress, while traumatized Genoq employees may be able to help the courier piece together what happened at the building prior to the player's arrival.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mere hours after receiving an urgent call in his Paris apartment, the protagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in Singapore via jet pack, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical research facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist Jean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and seal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his problems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. All lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and furthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have run amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant warnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the item in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips Genoq.Something is amiss within Genoq Biolabs.Over the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the courier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal bioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, which had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a front for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling biological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the company to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, and the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed D/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the building. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's corporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in order to prevent details of their activities from going public.Upon reaching the top floor, the courier discovers that it was not Derrida, but rather D/Generation that sent for him, and that the package he carried with him held a neurotransmitter which it needed in order to escape the building. Trapped within a hallucinatory realm conjured by his own creation, Derrida warns the courier that D/Generation must not be allowed to leave, as it was designed to be a genetically perfect killer that could blend in anywhere. Utilizing Derrida's advice, the courier is successful in luring D/Generation into a trap where it is killed by powerful microwaves. With moments to spare, he escapes the building, preventing the airstrike and saving the remaining employees trapped within the Genoq building.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected rooms (called "scenes" within the game), accomplishing various tasks within them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each level is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents a particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The game alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with many scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of things, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security systems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. Certain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of dangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue survivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely cleared of enemies.As the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.At the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to manipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into the game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other Trackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides with a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two examples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking before they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close doors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success in many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as other devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way as to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and pattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since tougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be performed quickly.The player's Laser sidearm is a good example of how D/Generation marries action and puzzle design elements. Its first and most obvious purpose is to kill the various hostile inhabitants of the Genoq building, however it's beams can activate switches, and will also ricochet, so it is usefully in many situations in which the player might wish to activate a switch from a distance, or cannot feasibly approach one due to a particular hazard. Even in combat situations when one is faced with forces that represent an immediate danger, it often behooves the player to be mindful of other objectives within the environment, as a stray volley could, for instance, kill a survivor, thus depriving the player of an additional life as well as potential exposition.[CR]Weapons &amp; Items[CR]The arsenal of D/Generation, while not exceedingly deep, is decidedly tactical. Other than the Laser, which has unlimited uses, all items within the game are collected individually, with most being quite rare. With such limited quantities, this means that even using a single Grenade might have serious repercussions later on, like the inability to fight back against a deadly C/Generation. In general, it is a good idea to only use an item when presented the a situation which would be otherwise extremely difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.LaserLaser The first weapon found by the courier and the only one which has unlimited uses, the Laser is an invaluable tool not only for killing lesser Neogens like A/Generations and B/Generations, but also for solving various puzzles throughout the game that might require long-range switch activation.GrenadeGrenade The secondary weapon to the Laser's primary, the Grenade will be used by most players as the first line of defense against C/Generations, which are completely immune to laser weaponry. They are also able to disable Trackers, though it is rarely wise to use them in this way, since Trackers can usually be avoided or neutralized in other ways.BombBomb Use of the Bomb places a small, pulsating, red pyramidal device directly at the player's feet. After a few moments, it detonates, obliterating anything destructible in the immediate vicinity (including the player). This blast can even destroy doors, which grants a rare opportunity to access restricted zones without need of a key.ClockClock The Clock immediately slows down time for everything within the game world save the player, albeit for only a short period of time. When expecting heavy, hectic opposition, or when a particular puzzle might require an extremely fast execution of actions, the Clock can be invaluable.ShieldShield Upon use, the Shield seemingly causes the player to go out of focus. While the Shield is active, the player cannot be killed; the benefits of such a state should be readily apparent. Certain potent attacks such as Tracker grenades may destroy the Shield, but the player will not be killed as a result.Plasma BarrierPlasma Barrier The Plasma Barrier gives the player the ability to project a bouncing barrier similar to those created by Genoq's normal security system. It can be thought of as a hybrid of the Laser and the Grenade, as it has the ricocheting capability of the former combined with the destructive force of the latter.[CR]Neogens[CR]The products of Genoq's covert organic weapons research, the lethal Neogens have overrun Genoq Biolabs, permeating all levels of the building through use of ventilation shafts. In addition to the threat posed by the constructs themselves, oftentimes additional Neogens will spawn through vents, doing so indefinitely until said vents are closed by the player. Certain types seem mostly interested in the player (C/Generation), while others show no reservations in attacking survivors when given the opportunity (A/Generation).A/GenerationA/Generation Certainly one of the most numerous Neogens found throughout Genoq Biolabs, the A/Generation is a bouncing red sphere whose primary intended purpose was battlefield cleanup, though it has no qualms trying to "clean" the building's denizens, including the player. Their attack does not instantly kill, thus it is possible to break free of an A/Generation if a laser beam hits it after it begins absorbing the player.B/GenerationB/Generation The blue, cylindrical B/Generation is both faster and more deadly than its predecessor, the A/Generation. Purportedly capable of traveling in excess of seventy kilometers per hour, it subdues its target by simply crushing it from above, killing it instantaneously. While this compaction is quite handy in simplifying corpse disposal, it unfortunately means that their is no window of opportunity to survive the attack.C/GenerationC/Generation Of the more devious of Genoq's creations is the deceptive C/Generation, an organism that can mimic nearly anything, animate or inanimate. It will usually lie in wait for its victim, revealing its true form only when its hapless target is close enough to be attacked and decapitated. It is much more persistent than previously encountered Neogens, as evidenced by its propensity to follow the player between room.D/GenerationD/Generation The latest Neogen, the D/Generation prototype has no direct attacks per se, but does have the frightening ability to cause powerful, unshakable hallucinations, which render its victims powerless. It was built with certain safety precautions which would prevent it from ever leaving the Genoq facility of its own free will, but that has not stopped it from taking over the building's computer network and turning Genoq's creations against it.[CR]Security Measures[CR]Subverted by D/Generation's influence, the protective measures of Genoq Biolabs are a constant hindrance to the player. They at times can be overcome through sheer brute force, such as when using a Bomb to blow a path through a secured door, though more often than not players must simply be mindful of the threat they pose if they wish to survive their ordeal. In particular, players should always be on the lookout for keys, as they are the main means of progression on most floors.Security KeySecurity Key Littered throughout the Genoq facility are a multitude of Security Keys which grant differing levels of security clearance. There is a clear progression in most areas which leads players to find keys with successively higher clearance levels, though keys can sometimes be obtained out of order, or rendered unnecessary with a well-placed Bomb.Electrified PlateElectrified Plate / Land Mine Both Electrified Plates and Land Mines are stationary emplacements which do not present a threat unless a player attempts to walk over one. Electrified Plates will turn on and off intermittently, providing an opportunity to pass by, whereas Land Mines are constantly in an active state, and are only neutralized if triggered by something.TrackerTracker A troublesome presence throughout all ten levels of Genoq Biolabs, the Tracker is a sentry turret that will fire upon any human target directly in front of it. They come in two basic varieties: those that face a fixed position, and those that rotate in order to seek targets in all directions.Plasma BarrierPlasma Barrier The Plasma Barrier is a rebounding environmental hazard which typically bounces in a set pattern within a certain scene. They are capable of activating switches as well, so in some cases they represent active puzzle elements rather than mere passive obstructions.TeleporterTeleporter A Teleporter pad will transport a player or object instantaneously to another like pad in the immediate vicinity. Most types of player ordinance can be projected through a Teleporter, which is useful knowledge in cases when a Tracker or other danger awaits on the other side.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In the third game in the Dan Dare series, Dan has been kidnapped by the evil Treens, lead by Dan's arch enemy, the Mekon. He is taken to their scientific satellite orbiting Venus, but it doesn't take long for Dan to break free and go down into their ship. While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some.[CR]The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that get in his way using a variety of weapons, bought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon can be seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will eventually run out of fuel.[CR]This is the 16-bit version of the game, which differentiates from its 8-bit cousins. As well as an introduction that leads into the game, more weapons are added, and each of the game's five levels are structured differently.</plot>

			<plot>[CR]BACKGROUND[CR]200 years on from Driller times, the Ketars take revenge. On the Dark Side of Evath's other moon, Trucuspid, a giant weapon, Zephyr One, has been constructed aimed to blow Evath to bits.To gain sufficient power, a network of ECD's (Energy Collection Devices) were constructed around the moon. The suspended solar cell at the ECD apex collects energy from Evath's sun then transmits this energy through the power line matrix for the final assault on Evathkind.[CR]OBJECTIVE[CR]To avoid mass panic on Evath this mission is highly confidential. You have been dropped inconspicuously on Tricuspid into a safe zone by a routine patrol ship. Your mission is to destroy every ECD, thus disabling the Zephyr One weapon and saving Evath from certain destruction. Score guide - first week target - one million points.[CR]YOUR EQUIPMENT[CR]Your space suit comes complete with quad lasers, a plasma band shield, jet power pack for extra mobility, plus a small supply of fuel.[CR]YOUR VIEW[CR]The display shows the Freescape TM generated view through your space suit helmet. The LED lights to the right indicate the rate at which the ECD's are collecting power. When the top LED lights, Zephyr One will fire!!![CR]TIME IS CRUCIAL[CR]Evath is only minutes away from destruction. Every time an ECD is successfully disabled the energy collection rate will be slowed, thus allowing more time.ONLY THE BEST WILL SUCCEED.GOOD LUCK![CR]</plot>

			<plot>In the game similar to Moon Blaster, you are a pilot of ground-skimming jet sent on the  surface of some dark hostile planet to eliminate the enemies blasting them off. There are four kinds of enemies determined by brain and force in 4-points scale, and you may assign them before the start of your mission. Sitting in the cockpit in first-person view, you may speed up or turn your jet, collect different weapons such as lasers, missiles, powers, and blast the enemy tanks or environment off. You should examine the scanner to see the directions and distances of the threats, and watch the shield level until it reaches zero.</plot>

			<plot>Gameplay Types The game consists of three different kinds of stages. Platforming stagesShooting gallery stagesDangling Stages The platforming stages are standard. run and jump across obstacles in the environment while avoiding or attacking enemies, until you reach the end of the level. At that point Darkman will either proceed to the next level or face a boss fight, if the player is going up against one of the members of Durant's gang. During the levels where you are attacking one of Durant's crew, Darkman spends part of the level disguised as the boss of the level. Darkman can do the boss' moves, and enemies will not necessarily attack you. However, this disguise only lasts for a limited time, determined by how well the player did on the photography stages.  The shooting gallery stages put you behind a camera, instead of a gun, as you take pictures of the boss of the next stage to build up a disguise. While Darkman cannot be killed on this stage, your performance determines how long Darkman's disguise lasts on the next level.  Dangling stages put Darkman hanging at the end of a rope underneath a helicopter as he's sent through traffic, like in the climactic scene with Durant towards the end of the film. Through this, Darkman can move up and down the rope, and collect power-ups and 1-ups in the environment. However, he can also be killed if he hits too many vehicles.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. [CR]You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.[CR]From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.[CR]The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</plot>

			<plot>The evil magician Drax is terrorizing the jeweled city and cast a spell over the beautiful princess Marina who is forced to obey him. From the lands to the north, a hero is sent to help the city and free the princess. He is Gorth, the strongest of the barbarian warriors. With his sword in hand, he has to beat eight of Drax's best warriors and at last the magician himself. He will fight them in the woods, on the mountaintop, in the dungeon... finally reaching Drax's palace itself.[CR]This is essentially a one- or two-player fighting game where you control a big barbarian and fight another player or a computer AI.  There are several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half a point while others take off a whole point. Each player has six of these "power points". They also have a special hard to perform "death sword" which decapitates your opponent, killing him with one fell swoop.</plot>

			<title_clean>Defender of the Crown</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A siege on an enemy castle.Defender of the Crown is a Strategy game set in Medieval England. The player takes control over a young Saxon man (either Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword or Wolfric the Wild) wishing to become the King of England after the previous King (King Richard) is murdered by a Norman traitor, and the crown has been stolen. After being recruited by Robin Hood to fight for the good of the country, the player starts out with only one castle and ten soldiers and must build up his force to take back the crown and avenge the king's death by fighting against several Norman factions.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay revolves around a Risk-style board of England in which players defend their territories from the Norman Factions, and partake in ruthless conquest in a bid to take over their territories. Amassing larger bands of troops increases the players chances of success. Many territories contain enemy castles. Upon launching an attack on a castled territory, the player must lay siege to the enemy castle by firing boulders at the castle wall from a catapult. The player can also decide to raid enemy castles for loot, which he can then use to strengthen his forces.In addition to this primary gameplay, several side-missions exist, including:A Jousting Match.Rescuing captured princesses: The player will occasionally receive a message from a damsel in distress, asking to be rescued from an enemy castle. The player must raid the enemy castle, sword-fighting towards the princess at the top of the castle. Upon the successful rescue of the princess, the player's character will marry the princess. There is a brief scene in which the shadowy figures of the character and the princess are seen seductively approaching each other, and their shadows are seen passionately kissing.Jousting matches: Occasionally invitations to rival factions tournaments will be received, in which the character must engage their rivals in mounted jousting battles. The player must line up their lance with the centre of the opponent's shield in order to knock him off the horse. A monetary prize is granted to the winner, which can be used to benefit your military conquest. The hero can also hold his own jousting tournaments from time to time.[CR][B]Ending:[/B][CR]Upon successfully completing the game (by defeating all the Norman factions) it is revealed that it was in fact Robin Hood who stole the crown. He did this in order to provide the hero a platform to prove their worthiness to become the new king of England. Robin returns the crown to the hero who is crowned king, and everyone lives happily ever after.[CR]Platform Differences[CR]The Amiga Version.Defender of the Crown was released on many different platforms. The main differences between platforms were the huge graphical differences. The Amiga version boasted the most technically proficient graphics and was heavily praised as one of the best looking games in 1986. The ports to the NES and DOS were the least graphically desirable versions of the game due to the limitations of the hardware.The DOS Version.Some gameplay differences also existed. The original Amiga version was rushed due to financial constraints on the developers, so several planned features (most notably attacking options such as flaming projectiles for the catapults and disease-based attacks) were absent from the final product. These features were included in some of the later ports of the game, including the Atari ST version.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Defender of the Crown was branded as an "interactive movie" and described by developers as a homage to several classic Hollywood movies, specifically Ivanhoe &amp; Robin Hood.Five pages of the game's manual are dedicated to discussing the legend of Robin Hood and his historicity.At the time Defender of the Crown was the largest game ever released, taking up 1.5MB. For this reason, the tape version of the Commodore 64 release needed to be edited to remove several pictures, including pictures of Robin Hood at the start of the game.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP SP3 / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10Processor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 12. 2 MB available space[CR]System Requirements (Mac)[CR]MinimumOS :OS X 10.7.0 or newerProcessor : Intel Core 2 Duo 2 GHz+ processorMemory : 512 MB RAMGraphics : 256 MB VRAMHard Drive : 12.2 MB available space[CR]</plot>

			<plot>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.[CR]Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.</plot>

			<title_clean>Deja Vu</title_clean>
			<plot>D&#233;j&#224; Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!! is the first game made by ICOM, known for its adventure games such as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. In Deja Vu, action takes place in Chicago in December 1941. Your character's name is Theodore "Ace" Harding - a retired boxer working as a private eye. He wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who he is or what he is doing there. To make matters worse, you as him soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegetable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.</plot>

			<plot>As in Stormlord, you must rescue as many fairies as possible, on this occasion by catching them out of the sky as they fall. This isn't as easy as it sounds, because this scrolling platform shooter has many sections in which the fairies are falling towards fiery pits, and you must catch them without hitting this pit. The controls allow you to jump, and then jump again while falling, so you can, with effort, climb most of the way up the screen. The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives - although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.</plot>

			<plot>The sequel to Millennium 2.2 (released two years prior), is a space strategy game in which you start with a minimum amount of supplies and scientific knowledge, and must expand beyond Earth to explore and colonize other planets.As Earth has been devastated by war, the available remaining population must be trained either for research, production or as marines in order to be assigned to their different jobs. As your research team discovers new technologies and items, and your mining facilities gather the needed material, your production team can start building the items necessary to your expansion. When your first space shuttle is built, you can launch it to build an orbital factory station which, in turn, allows you to build larger interplanetary spacecraft to reach farther planets with rare minerals.As you colonize other planets, gather new materials, and mine asteroids, you will be able to build different items not available at the beginning of the game. Certain spacecraft can later be equipped with devices to automate asteroid mining and transportation of minerals from one location to another. The graphics of Deuteros are dark and consist of mostly static screens with basic animations. There is no background music during gameplay, only futuristic sound effects. The interface uses simple point-and-click on different icons and buttons (more functions become available as the game advances.)</plot>

			<plot>A scientist obsessed with Picasso's cubist paintings develops a weapon that turns everything to cubes. The United Kingdom sends a secret agent to revert the affected objects and monuments back to their original state.[CR]Devious Designs is a puzzle game where geometric shapes have to be assembled. The player controls a 007-style secret agent that has the ability to walk on the walls, lift heavy objects and shoot. Using these, he must drag and drop the geometric pieces scattered on the screen (by standing next to them and holding the fire button) on translucent slots. Each level is a screen with a timer on the top. When the counter runs out, the level is reset and the player looses one life. Like in Bubble Bobble, various objects fall from the screen that can be collected for points, along with more useful power-ups like explosives, extra-time, extra-lives and a special block than fills a slot (it can be shot if it's not needed). Also, if the player takes too long to solve the level a random enemy appears, but it can be killed by the agent's gun.[CR]The game starts with 6 lives and has a password system.</plot>

			<plot>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a 2D shooting gallery.In the early 90&#8217;s, two things just wouldn&#8217;t die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington&#8217;s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You&#8217;ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist&#8217;s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don&#8217;t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist&#8217;s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.For more information on the movie Die Hard 2, see the trivia and links sections.</plot>

You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

			<plot>Create a party of eight characters from the usual D&amp;D classes, and lead these characters on their quest for adventure.[CR]The initial character development is fairly comprehensive, but the user interface for the game itself is a 2D top-down perspective with symbolic representations of everything. The game map is a simple grid with icons in various squares to denote the location of your characters, monsters, trees, etc. Combat takes place on a "zoomed-in" map of the same variety, and is turn-based.</plot>

			<plot>Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel superhero is not enough to stop him. As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</plot>

Try to shot down the opponent, avoid getting hit and avoid the large airship who floats around in the airspace. If you fly too high you will lose control of the airplane and it will crash. Sometimes a truck driving at the bottom of the screen will fire a surface-to-air missile making the situation a bit harder to manage.</plot>

			<plot>Doodlebug is a side-scrolling platform sequel to the programmer's earlier shooter Bug Bash in a very colourful cartoony style. Your aim as the "Doodlebug" is to make your way through five different levels (with three sub-levels each), killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie.The most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies (presuming you've picked some up). If the pencil's flight path is uninterrupted then they'll draw a useful item for you: Either an Umbrella (for long falls), Ball (to be able to jump onto higher platforms), a Potion (invincibility), a Clock (stops time) and an Eraser (kills everything on screen).</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released in 1987 in arcades, Double Dragon is an early brawler game credited, in part, for the popularity of the beat-em-up genre during the 1980s and 1990s. The game was first developed by Technos Japan Corporation and published by Taito Corporation, and has since been ported to numerous consoles, computers, handhelds, and even cellular phones. The game also spawned the popular Double Dragon franchise, which has had five games in the main franchise, as well as two Neo-Geo fighting games.After the initial arcade release, the game has been ported to a variety of systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 (two different versions), PC, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari Lynx, Xbox Live Arcade, Zeebo, iPhone and Android. Every release differs in some aspect or another, particularly the Game Gear, NES, Game Boy, and Atari 2600 versions.The game's popularity led to several sequels (with the latest iteration released in 2003), a cartoon series (which ran for two seasons), a comic book (published by Marvel, ran for six issues), and even a movie (which was released in 1994, inspired by the television cartoon). The cartoon and its resulting movie release were both loosely based on the NES version of the game, whereas Jimmy Lee is initially a villain (having been raised by the antagonist of the franchise, the Shadow Master).The game's soundtrack was composed by Kazunaka Yamane, and was released in an album on February 21, 1988. The soundtrack, titled Original Sound of Double Dragon, features all nine tracks from the arcade version of the game. These tracks are all arranged versions of the songs found in the game.GameplayDouble Dragon follows Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee (incorrectly named Hammer and Spike in the promotional materials with the American version of the arcade game), two martial artists whose love interest, Marian, is kidnapped by a gang called the Black Warriors. Playing in cooperative mode triggers a different ending, where Billy and Jimmy must fight each other for the affection of Marian.The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade versionA three button beat-em-up, there are three base moves in Double Dragon; punching, kicking, and jumping. Various combinations of these moves produce other moves, such as head butts, elbow smashes, jumping kicks, backwards kicks, or the signature Double Dragon hair grab (in which the character grabs the enemy by the hair, making them vulnerable to attacks and throws).In addition to moves, Double Dragon has a variety of weapons that can be carried from fight to fight (this was altered in the NES version, where weapons could only be used if the enemy it was taken from is still alive). There are four weapons; baseball bats, whips (neither of which are incredibly effective), knives (which are arguably the most powerful weapons in the game), and explosives (timed explosives which can be thrown).[CR]Other Versions[CR]NES VersionOnly two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES versionReleased in 1988 (and later on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008), the NES version of Double Dragon was among the better received ports of the game. Published by Tradewest, Double Dragon on the NES has many differences from the arcade game on which it is based, beyond the obvious decrease in graphical and sound quality. The plot was altered, due to the exclusion of a two-player cooperative mode. Rather than fighting the leader of the Shadow Warriors, Billy Lee faces off against his brother, Jimmy Lee.Other than the single player story, there are a few other modes that implement two player gameplay. Mode A allows players to do a tag-team style game, alternating who is playing after each death. Mode B is a one-on-one tournament fighting game, where players can choose to fight either computer controlled opponents or player controlled characters.The two player fighting mode in NES versionThe game also implemented an upgrade system, where players earn hearts for dispatching certain amounts of enemies. These hearts upgrade the character's abilities, allowing for more complicated moves such as backwards elbowing and face punching. In addition to moves, there are a variety of weapons available, ranging from baseball bats to whips (as well as ranging in damage dealt, and subsequently usefulness).There are many other differences found in the NES version, some due to general technical limitations. For example, only two enemies can be onscreen simultaneously due to the NES's abilities. Naturally, the stage design deviates from what was found in the original arcade version, including new areas, expanded sections, and completely new levels.Master System VersionSega Master System home console port of Double DragonAfter the NES version was released, Sega brought the game to their 8-bit platform as well. Due to the Sega Master System's more powerful hardware, the Master System version has better graphics (with more colors), more enemies on-screen, and modes and levels that are very similar to the arcade version.Unlike the NES version of Double Dragon, the Sega Master System version retains the two-player cooperative mode found in the original arcade version. Although it doesn't include the head-to-head versus mode found in the NES game, Double Dragon on the Sega Master System does have one other feature not found in the NES or arcade versions; an unlimited amount of continues (except for the final level).Mega Drive/Genesis VersionIn 1992, Double Dragon was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. This game was developed by Ballistic, and is very similar to the arcade release. Double Dragon on the Sega Genesis was criticized for one key aspect; its control. The game, according to fans and critics, makes it incredibly difficult to hit enemies, with small hit boxes and sloppy movement.Handheld VersionsThe Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable characterThe game has had three different handheld ports; Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and Atari Lynx. The first of these three versions was released in 1990. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon is heavily influenced by the NES game, with similar level design, enemies, and overall graphical style.The Game Boy version varies on one key aspect from the NES Double Dragon; it does not include the heart system found in this game. Every move is accessible from the start. In some areas, portions of stages were removed completely for the Game Boy port, particularly some platforming segments of the final stage. Additionally, every character in the two player fighting mode was removed except for Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee.On the Game Gear, Double Dragon was significantly different from other versions of the game. Subtitled "The Revenge of Billy Lee" in Europe, this game centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee, and Billy Lee's quest of vengeance against the Dragon Clan. Other than this, the game was largely a different game, with altered stage design, different weapons (i.e. guns), and the lack of any modes beyond a single player story mode.With large sprites, the Atari Lynx version is another recreation of the original arcade game. Giving only a small view of the stage, the game was criticized due to the fact that enemy and character sprites take up nearly three fourths of the Lynx's screen size. The Atari Lynx version also includes a practice mode, which allows players to fight a varying amount of enemies to learn the controls and moves of the game.In 2003 the game received an enhanced remake for the Game Boy Advance in the form of Double Dragon Advance, which added several new features including cutscenes, additional levels, and new moves.Smartphone VersionSmartphone versionIn 2011 a smartphone version of Double Dragon was released on both iPhone and Android. Rather than a straight port, this version adds several features, some of which originated in the Game Boy Advance remake. In addition to the Lee brothers, players can unlock 24 playable characters for use in any mode.Other VersionsLike the sequels to Double Dragon, Binary Designs worked on computer ports to create a variety of versions of the game. Additionally, a second Commodore 64 port was created by Ocean Software, and differed in many ways from the previous Commodore 64 port. While all of the games naturally differ from the arcade game on which they are based, there are several relevant details relating to the ports.The ZX Spectrum version was incredibly different when it came to graphical style. Due to an attempt at the detail of the arcade version, this version had character and enemy sprites which were transparent other than the black outlines. This, combined with an attempt at some detailed color, caused the game to run very slowly.Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by ActivisionBoth of the Commodore 64 ports were very close in style, attempting to emulate the gameplay of the arcade release (the first even included a two player mode, almost unheard of among the computer ports). A major difference for the first version was a complete lack of sound, other than the sound effects created by punching and kicking. The second version lacked a two player mode, although it is considered by Double Dragon fans to be a slightly better port.Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, these two ports were handled by Activision. The 2600 version of the game naturally cut much of the game's content; with redone sound and graphics to fit the platform's capabilities, removed enemy sprites, cut weapons, and a shorter story mode (although there is still a two player cooperative mode, as well as a two player versus mode). The 7800 version was improved graphically and sound-wise, although it removes the versus mode.SoundtrackOpening (Double Dragon)The City Slums (The Black Warriors Arrive)The Industrial Area (The Great Fray)After the BattleSetting Off (A New Battle)The WoodsThe Giant Abobo AppearsThe Hideout (Willy the Nemesis)Ending (Reunion With Marian)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement.Two Amstrad CPC ports of Double Dragon were created. One for the CPC 6128 hardware, which was very well-received and released almost exclusively in France, and another version created for the CPC 464 which was universally panned.The more well-received version of Double Dragon on the Amstrad CPC actually had more in common with the Atari ST and Amiga versions.An advertising campaign from Data East around the release of Bad Dudes stated that, "Bad Dudes Makes Double Dragon Pale by Comparison."Most versions of Double Dragon are infamous for their glitches and exploits, such as suicidal enemies, weapons that can be carried to future stages, frozen sprites, incorrect graphics, and even walking up walls or in the air.

			<title_clean>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II centers around the murder of MarianOriginally released in 1988 as an arcade game, Double Dragon II: The Revenge is the sequel to Double Dragon, which was released in 1987. Double Dragon II once again stars Jimmy and Billy Lee as they investigate the murder of Marian, the love interest of the series. Marian was shot to death by a group known as the Black Warriors. Other than the original arcade release, there have been a variety of home console versions, including releases for the NES, Game Boy, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Amiga. These versions all differ in a variety of ways, from minor elements to major gameplay changes.On March 10, 1990, Meldac released the soundtrack of Double Dragon II: The Revenge in Japan. Featuring new renditions of the songs from the NES version of the game, including arranged songs and a pop remix of the opening theme, with vocals sung by Manami Morozumi. The soundtrack, composed by Kazuhiro Hara and Nobuhito Tanahashi, contains 13 songs, two of which are different renditions of the same song (Dead or Alive, one with lyrics and one without).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade Version The first level in the arcade game.The original arcade release is essentially the same as its predecessor. The game is a side scrolling beat-em-up, in which players can fight enemies across a four stages: an airport, lumberhouse, a field, and the base of operations for the Black Warriors. The largest differences between the original Double Dragon and Double Dragon II are improved moves, range of attack, and control scheme. In Double Dragon, players could either kick or punch. Double Dragon II changes this, and opts instead for directional based attacks (e.g. if the player is facing to the right, one button will send out a flurry of punches and the other button will have the character kick from the back).In addition to friendly characters, all of the enemies have received significant makeovers as well. As well as a range of new enemy characters (including the final boss, Willy, leader of the Black Warriors), enemies now have new weapons to carry around and use, including shovels and hand grenades. Enemy attacks are also modified, including a new range of combos and special attacks (to combat the new moves that Jimmy and Billy have received, such as the Hurricane Kick).NES Version The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard.Possibly the most well known version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, the NES version was originally released on December 23, 1989 in Japan, and then later released in North America during January of 1990. Published by Acclaim Entertainment and developed by Technos, Double Dragon II for the NES is very different from the arcade version on which it is based. Similar to the previous NES game, Double Dragon, this NES game is a one to two player side scrolling beat-em-up, although this was the first version of a Double Dragon game on the NES that could be played by two players simultaneously in co-op. The game has an expanded story, including cutscenes before each stage (of which there are nine). In addition, there is a separate final boss in the NES version, which can only be fought on the hardest difficult level. Upon being defeated, Marian is brought back to life (unlike the arcade version).The Lee brothers retain the bi-directional attacks from the arcade version (with B and A on the NES pad corresponding to Left and Right attacks, respectively) as well as the spinning Hurricane Kick special move. In addition, they can execute "hyper" uppercut and "hyper" flying knee attacks, which send enemies flying skyward and backwards, respectively. The latter move is particularly useful for making quick work of enemies (including boss characters) when fighting near a bottomless pit area. While the Hurricane Kick can be executed on the fly by jumping and then tapping both buttons at the peak of the jump, the latter two must be executed by timing button presses almost perfectly when the player character is just exiting his kneeling frame of animation (initiated by either landing from a jump or getting up from a fall), making them slightly more complex moves to pull off.Stage design (as well as several new stages with story sequences playing out before each one), modes, and the plot changes are all among the differences between the arcade and NES versions of Double Dragon II. Arguably the largest change is the addition of a two-player "Mode B", where the players can damage each other during the game - this factor was subsequently used to discover a number of exploits and shortcuts by the speedrun community. (Another side effect of "Mode B" was that if one player killed another, the first player would gain the life that the other player lost, something that could be used to give a single player up to 7 lives.) Additionally, Double Dragon II on the NES adds five new stages, differing enemies, radically different stage design, and a new final boss (named the Mysterious Warrior).Other VersionsOther than the well-known arcade and NES versions, there have been a variety of other ports of Double Dragon II: The Revenge. Two other home console ports were produced in 1991 and 1993 (both exclusively in Japan) for the Sega Mega Drive and the PC Engine respectively. The Mega Drive version is largely unchanged from the arcade game, only slightly altering the second stage. The PC Engine version featured upgraded graphics (including the story sequences from the NES version, which are redone for this version), new music, slightly altered stage design, and voice acting for the main characters, including Billy, Jimmy, and Marian.Several ports were released for PC platforms as well, with Virgin Mastertronic and Binary Design handling ports to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST in 1989. These companies were the same companies to handle the PC ports of the original Double Dragon as well.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrackDead or Alive (2:48)The Vengeful Demon has Begun to Move (3:37)A Quiet Pursuit (3:01)Tension at the Night Sky (1:43)Advancing Towards Sunset (2:25)Escape to the Forest (3:43)Wicked God (1:25)Breaking the Barrier (2:37)Enter to the Enemy's Base (3:19)Roar of the Twin Dragons (3:55)Miracle of the Twin Dragons (1:25)Sweet Memories (3:13)[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Down Fall</title_clean>
			<plot>Downfall is an "endless runner" type of game in which the environment is constantly moving and control of the player is strictly limited. The player is controlling a little guy, travelling down over myriads of platforms which constantly scrolling from the bottom to the top. Moving is only possible from left to right, no jumping is possible. Leaving the stand on a platform, the player is starting to fall and must land on a deeper platform. Luckily, during flight limited horizontally movement is possible. The game ends if either the player reached the upper border (standing on a platform) or falls to the bottom border without landing on a platform.Points are gained by simply surviving, having the score counter constantly increasing. There are different levels which change without interruption and are marked with differently looking platforms. Randomly appearing fruits reward extra points depending on the level, and rarely extra items can be found like balloons slowing the speed of the fall. Some of those must be activated, some are instantly active.This arcade style of game was originally presented in the game Man goes down by Alex Herbert on the Atari 2600 and the authors of Downfall explicitly name this game as inspiration.The game supports modified Jaguar gamepads featuring "rotary control", means a paddle which can be endlessly turned left and right and therefore being a natural control for this game. The graphics are simple, but colorful multi-level parallax scrolling backgrounds are present in all versions.Falling down, the game simply asks you: "How low can you go?"</plot>

			<plot>The game was released on the PC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST. It was announced for the Amstrad CPC, but that version was never released.  There were some differences depending on which console you played the game. These mainly consisted of player character choices, however the Spectrum version had fewer characters than the other releases.      Version Exclusive  Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST Playable Characters: Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Doctor, Companions: Ace or UNIT soldier  MS-DOS/PC Playable Characters: Second, Fourth or Seventh Doctor, Companions: Ace or UNIT soldier  ZX Spectrum Playable Character: Seventh Doctor, Companion: Ace Other characters you encounter during the game include K-9 (The Doctor's robot dog) and Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who is also the final end of level boss.  Some versions of the game featured special Daleks, such as hovering Daleks from the 1960s TV Century 21 comic strips, the Peter Cushing 'movie' Daleks and the special weapons Dalek from "Remembrance of the Daleks" (the TV serial).  Its relationship with the TV series canon is in dispute, however it has been attempted to fit in between the Virgin New Adventures novel "Head Games", which suggests the game takes place in an alternative universe created by the Doctor whilst he is affected by energy from the Land of Fiction. The PC and Amiga versions both contained a secret room, hidden behind some blocks during one of the levels. It mostly contained  programming credits for the game, in particular for graphics and music. The credits were hidden due to the BBC not wanting individual credits given for the development team, possibly due to their stance on Doctor Who at the time of release.  The game was designed and storyboarded by 221B Software Development, the PC, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST versions were developed and published by Alternative Software.  The ZX Spectrum version was released due to popular demand in 1993.  It had a different first level to other releases of the game - in older versions of the opening level, The Doctor had to travel through a sewer on a hoverboard.   It was also the last licensed Spectrum game due to it no longer being a commercially viable platform.   Although the game was released by Alternative Software, it was advertised as being released by Admiral Software. This was due to Alternative Software being a budget software label, and that wasn't the image they wanted for this game. It was soon recalled due to legal action from a software house already called Admiral Software. The game boxes had stickers placed over the logo, and the in-game graphics featuring the logo were replaced or removed.  Later, the game was re-released in the "Sci-Fi Collection" with two other title (Galactic Warrior Rats and Suburban Commando) for the PC. This was later re-released itself with a slightly different cover in 1995.  The game engine created for the game by 221B Software was later re-used as the basis for the Suburban Commando game.

			<plot>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.[CR]The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoots energy bolts ferocity. The dragons tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. [CR]There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoots tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Spirit is a vertical shoot-em-up that owes many of its mechanics to Namco's earlier arcade hit Xevious. The most direct similarity is that the dragon has two forms of firepower: A fireball that hits aerial enemies and a bomb that hits ground-based enemies.The dragon can power up by collecting eggs: Red eggs will increase the power of the dragon's fire breath while the blue eggs allow him to grow an additional head, effectively doubling its damage output as well as increasing the coverage. It's possible to have up to three heads in total. In addition, there are also various weapon power-ups that provide a temporary boon such as larger flame spouts or enemy-seeking fireballs.Dragon Spirit saw many home conversions for both computers and consoles. The NES version, Dragon Spirit: The New Legend, made many modifications to the game.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon's Lair - Escape from Singe's Castle</title_clean>
			<plot>Dirk the Daring is a heroic, if clumsy knight. When Princess Daphne was kidnapped by the dragon, Singe, and taken to his castle... Dirk set out to rescue her. Due to a lack of disk and memory space in the systems of the day, the port of the arcade game, Dragon's Lair was split into two parts. The first part covered the half of the game dealing with entering Singe's Castle and saving the Princess. This second part, named Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle completes the game, continuing the adventure of Dirk the Daring after slaying Singe the Dragon.[CR]Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon's Lair II</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon's Lair III</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Lord (Dragon's Breath in Europe) is a strategy/raising-sim game from Outlaw and Palace Software. It was released for Atari ST, Amiga and PC MS-DOS.The player - as either the ruthless mercenary Bachim, the vampiress Oureod or the "green beast" Ametrin - must raise dragons and use them to find pieces of an amulet which will allow them to gain access to the mythical power of the cursed mountain in the center of the countryside.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Dragons need time and money to hatch due to the amount of heat involved in the incubation process so the player also needs to use their adult dragons to earn money by terrorizing the local settlements and taking in taxes while searching for the amulet pieces. The player can also spend money on reagents to produce potions that can increase the strength of the dragon (whether they're hatched or still in the egg) or increase the productivity and happiness of the villages under their control.The player can also play an action mini-game if they choose to take manual control of the dragon during its raids. These vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups play similarly to Namco's Dragon Spirit: however, if the player's dragon takes too much damage it'll die. If the player chooses to let the CPU handle it, they can choose the level of aggression that the dragon uses: the higher this level, the more damage the dragon causes but it also increases the chance of its death. Dragons can be killed by wandering barbarians or from taking too many damage from raiding runs, which can cause a massive blow to the player's funding and may remove them from the game. The game ends when all three players are no longer able to continue, or if one of them finds the complete amulet and reaches the mountain.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The premise of the game is that Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge McDuck to a contest to tell who of them is the richest duck in the world. The player has 30 days to collect treasures from around the world with the help of Huey, Dewey and Louie. Launchpad McQuack also joins them on the adventure.The game has several types of gameplay, among which is mountain-climbing with a rope, taking pictures of rare animals, and cave exploring, all based on classic arcade game types. It can probably be regarded as a lost relic in the Disney canon of games, as its existence is rarely referenced by anyone as the NES game is held in such high regard.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Dungeon Master</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dungeon Master is a first person dungeon adventure from developer FTL (Faster than Light). The quest is to descend through 14 levels of the eponymous Dungeon to retrieve the Fire Staff - the only weapon capable of stopping the evil Lord Chaos.Dungeon Master was originally released on the Atari ST home computer in 1987. It was later ported to various other home computers of the era, such as the Amiga, the PC, the FM Towns, the Sharp X68000 and the Apple-II. It would eventually see console ports on the Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx-CD as well. Dungeon Master was eventually followed up with a far more challenging expansion pack, Chaos Strikes Back, as well as a sequel in 1994: Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep.Dungeon Master was a trailblazing RPG in that it created the first truly real-time dungeon crawler. Previous games of the genre, such as Wizardry and Ultima, focused on long turn-based battles and thus were a little too ponderous for many. Dungeon Master's many boons to accessibility made it a huge hit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The quest begins in the Hall of Champions. Portraits of fallen warriors line the hallways and as the player views these they are able to resurrect them to join the party. Champions must be selected carefully to complement each other as each have different skills and equipment that will be needed on the journey.The game featured a sophisticated experience system for the time in which it was made. Each character is able to progress in four classes: Fighter, Ninja, Priest and Wizard. Advancement in each is dependent on using the skills relevant to the profession. For example, a character put at the front of the party that attacks enemies with melee weapons will advance in the fighter class. Ninja classes are raised by throwing items, Priest classes are raised by creating potions through magic and Wizard classes are raised by casting offensive spells. At any point the player can simply choose to spam an activity over and over to raise their levels, as with each level raised in any class came additional health, mana and other stats. This helped mitigate the game's occasional difficulty spikes, such as the tough worm monsters on the fourth floor.As well as the experience system Dungeon Master gave each character a number of additional attributes that needed to be carefully managed throughout the quest. Characters would need food, drink and rest. Food can be occasionally found after defeating monsters, water supplies can be replenished in the occasional fountain and it is important to remember that sleeping wherever enemies were close is always a mistake.The magic system in Dungeon Master includes various recipes for spells and potions, which requires casting the correct magical runes in order. If combined correctly a spell would result. If not, nothing would occur, but the player would still lose mana from the attempt. Basic spells are provided via scrolls but many are left to the player's experimentation, with knowledge of what each individual rune symbolizes as clues.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a maze-based arcade game, developed by Hudson Soft. The first in the Bomberman series, it unfortunately didn't contain any multiplayer. At the time it was well-received and today it is considered as a genre-defining video game. There has since been countless iterations on its blueprint and huge multiplayer communities around them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a robot working at a bomb factory who gets bored of making bombs. He hears a rumor that anyone that makes it out from the underground factory gets a wish. Bomberman, desperate to escape, sets out on a journey to the surface. The only thing standing in his way is the factory security guards who will do anything to stop him. Spoiler alert: Bomberman will turn into Runner when he reaches the surface.[CR]Other Versions[CR]The Famicom version differed slightly from the MSX original, so the Famicom version was ported back to the MSX under the title "Bomber Man Special".European versions were released under the names "Eric and the Floaters" (MSX/Spectrum) and Dyna Blaster (Amiga, Atari ST, and PC)[CR]</plot>

Sega released the game for their own system, the Sega Master System, in 1989 but only in Europe. Other versions would be released on European home computers like the Amiga and Atari ST. The game has a visual design reminiscent of US cartoons from the mid-20th century, such as Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle and Woody Woodpecker, with exaggerated facial expressions and surreal silliness.The player(s) proceeds across a series of stages, fighting unusual creatures and bosses via an assortment of ranged weapons and close combat. Ranged weapons tend to have limited uses and vanish after a while.[CR]</plot>

As with the manga, the game is set during the Three Kingdoms Era of Ancient China and allows the player to select between four warriors that would eventually represent the Western Shu kingdom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The players control any of the four warriors Zhang Fei, Liu Bei, Zhao Yun and Guan Yu riding on horseback and taking out enemy swordsmen and archers with various melee weapons.

The game has eight levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics.  For each of the four tropical islands, the surface has to be cleared at first by flying around in a side-scrolling perspective, reminiscent of Choplifter. Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed.The basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank.  When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank.After all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter. Gameplay in these sections is traditional, save for the fact that the player travels downwards from the upper part of the screen: dodging enemy bullets and shooting as many aliens as possible until the level end boss is reached and defeated. An upgraded chopper is important to survive these levels.</plot>

			<plot>Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.[CR]ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.</plot>

			<title_clean>ESLA League Manager III</title_clean>
			<plot>ESLA League Manager III is the final game in the series of German football managing games. For the first time in the series, the game is not only available in German, but also translated to English. Like in the predecessors, up to four players can manage a club in the first four leagues, participating in league and cup competitions (national and international).The graphical interface is much more colorful and more detailed information about player and team performance are shown, and the options to tweak the gameplay allow a finer control like in the former two games. For example you can set specific starting settings for your team and conditions for winning and loosing the game, like disabling the sacking because of debts, as well as the strength of leagues. You can choose the nation you want to play the leagues in, which is modifying player generation. Like in Spitzenreiter 2, the clubs are fantasy ones, but now they are assigned to a city, so now Liverpool is playing against Manchester, even if the clubs are called "Rebels Liverpool" and "Mj&#246;llnir Manchester". For single matches, tactical formations can be set, you can set a motivation level for the game, bribe the referee or set an extra bonus for the players. Also, the training options are extended, you can either set the pre-season training schedule for six weeks and during the season the training for a single week. Games are still presented as series of the events like goals, but after the match a finer analyses of the game including individual ranks for each player, is shown. On the transfer market you can strengthen your team by buying new players or negotiate the contracts of the players of your squad.</plot>

			<plot>Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets you in charge initially of a small single-celled organism, and challenges you to guide its evolution. Your initial tasks are to roam around finding food, and then find a potential mate. Depending on your organism's status, different predators will be after you - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, you are taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and you have the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually you can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish or even human.</plot>

			<plot>After six years away from Earth, your delivery contract is finally over, you've been paid a fat cheque and you can't wait to get home. As your ship gets closer and closer to the old beloved blue planet, the anticipation mounts.[CR]But wait! What's this? The earth is an unfamiliar, grey husk! A vast alien mothership hangs above it, mercilessly sucking out all of its natural resources. While you were away, the Eco Phantoms arrived, and did this![CR]Now, you've managed to steal an Eco zeppelin craft and have gone down to Earth, to try to reverse the planet-draining process before it's too late. The Eco Phantoms have built several domes on the planet's surface, which house their buildings and equipment. You'll have to navigate through three of these domes, learning how to operate and maintain your alien craft, gathering resources, collecting data spheres, rescuing prisoners and engaging in confrontations with the Eco forces. Eventually, if you survive long enough, you'll be able to enter the alien mothership, where you will have to reprogram the main computer, to reverse the process and restore Earth to life.[CR]Eco Phantoms is quite an ambitious mix of exploration, combat and strategy.</plot>

Every of the 32 levels plays out on a non-scrolling field where the player has to evade two enemies and touch certain tiles. This causes objects to appear which can be picked up and dropped at another place. If an enemy touches an object, it transforms into a pill which also has to be picked up and dropped elsewhere. There are save tiles where the enemies can't touch the player.</plot>

			<title_clean>Elite</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Elite is a space trader game with cockpit-view space travel sections that occasionally involved combat. Originally released for the BBC Micro in 1984, it was quickly ported to various other systems both inside and outside the UK. It was followed by multiple sequels that expanded the depth of the game's vision of a fully explorable universe, the most recent of which is the 2014 game Elite: Dangerous.The game starts as all Elite games do by setting the player into the open world with 100 credits and a lightly-armed cargo ship (the Cobra Mk III in this instance). The main thrust of the game is to simply earn credits through trading goods between different space stations and making a profit by taking advantage of the variable prices of different products between systems. This is not the only method by which the player can earn credits, however, and Elite was revolutionary at the time in that it allows the player free choice in which role/roles they enter into during gameplay. Ships encountered can be destroyed and plundered, military missions can be taken up, asteroids can be mined for resources and lucrative bounty hunting contracts are available. The player is never tied into a career and can jump between jobs at any point. Beyond this there is no overarching story or even backstory with the aim of the game being simply to explore and earn credits.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] revolves around travel between planets (planetary systems are not available) by way of a hyperspace drive which requires fuel to be replenished at the destination port. The skill behind the gameplay was in choosing the right items to trade so the maximum credits were earned from different trading runs.Military missions mostly involves destroying ships or transporting sensitive cargo, but aimed to take the player to parts of the universe not often explored, such as anarchic worlds never worth the risk for a simple trade run. Similarly, destroying ships often revolve around attacking unique prototype ships leading to intense dogfights of a higher difficulty to those randomly encountered travelling between planets.Bounty hunting runs along similar lines with missions taking the player into dangerous territory and often involves fighting higher quality ships for which the player received far greater monetary rewards. Credits can be spent on ship upgrades which in turn unlocks varied types of gameplay. Mining lasers allows the mining of asteroids which often gives up valuable minerals whilst making the player a tempting target for pirates, and the fuel scoop allowed the player to catch fuel by skillfully flying close to the surface of stars.[CR]Locations[CR]The notion of an open-world game at the time was unheard of. With eight galaxies and 256 planets in each galaxy the game had to be procedurally generated to due to the limitations of the 8-bit computers of the time (the entire game fits into 22KB of memory on the BBC Micro, for example). As such each galaxy, whilst being unique to each player, will all have planets with a pre-determined composition. The issue with creating the galaxies by this method is that it would occasionally lead to galaxies being in positions whereupon reaching them, the hyperspace drive would not be powerful enough to transport the player out again, which in essence broke the game.Planets vary in terms of safety with some entirely safe and others more prone to attack by the game's primary antagonists, the Thargoids (whose homeworld was highly dangerous) and pirates who would intercept the player in more lawless territories. Technical limitations ensured that the player not land on planets, with every planet having an orbiting space station that they could dock into but not explore.[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]With the game garnering high critical praise and selling handsomely sequels were forthcoming.  Frontier: Elite 2 was released in 1993 adding textures, an expanded game world and a new control method, moving the game away from its Arcade-style along with a raft of other expansions. This was followed by  Frontier: First Encounters which garnered significant negative press due to its premature release resulting in the game being filled with game-breaking bugs. Elite 4 has been in development since 1999 for PC and modern consoles yet the lack of information on it has led to fears of the game being vaporware. All that has been heard is that the game was once an MMO before being restarted due to technical limitations and more recently a source indicated to eurogamer.net that pre-production has been put on hold indefinitely while Frontier Development's title "The Outsider" was completed.In December of 2014, the Kickstarter-funded sequel Elite: Dangerous was released for the PC, with Mac and console versions to follow. Elite: Dangerous was one of the first games to be featured on the Xbox One's Game Preview Program.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]It was possible to come across a product named 'Tribbles' when visiting space stations. If the player decides to buy it and then undock into open space again, after a short time of flying, small light-colored blobs will start to appear on the screen. After a while the whole screen will be completely filled with these blobs making it completely impossible to fly. This is a reference to the Star Trek (the original series) episode called "The Trouble with Tribbles", where small furry animals get into a space station and start breeding at a phenomenal rate until they completely infest it. This is only available in the Commodore 64 version.In certain versions when docking or during the intro the Blue Danube Waltz is played as a nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey.Stills of the game were displayed in the music video for 'Pump Up The Volume' by MARRS.The launch of game was unique for the time. A special larger box housed the game and came with a novella on the game world to gain extra attention. The game was launched at a launch party at Thorpe Theme Park in the UK (an unheard of marketing move at the time) and there was a contest for the first gamer to reach "Elite" rank within the game.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Elvira is a horror adventure game that was released in 1990 by Accolade. Elvira was the second game to come from Horrorsoft, their first being a game called Personal Nightmare in which Elvira also made an appearance.The game is based on a B-movie about the character of Elvira. Cassandra Peterson created the character of Elvira - a crypt keeper who entertains her guests with scary stories.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]On the demise of Uncle Elmo, Elvira inherited Castle Killbragant. However, the castle is full of monsters. When she visited the castle she was imprisoned by the various creatures returning from the underworld. The player, an amateur ghoul-buster, has to help Elvira escape. Players must find six keys to open the chest an dispose of the creatures that are encountered. In doing so, players explore her enormous castle. There are towers, dungeons, catacombs and gardens; all locations connected by doors and pathways.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Elvira was one of the first mouse games touting the sophisticated modern nature of its "point and click" interface. Icons for examine, mix, pick-up, and other context sensitive commands allow the player to manipulate the environs of the castle. Magic spells are used to improve skill in combat and advance the plot through solving object-oriented puzzles.To move around, players click on any part of the screen or click on one of the highlighted direction arrows. The latter moves the player forward, up, or down in the direction they are facing; the left, right, and back arrows change that direction, and redisplay the perspective from it.Armed guards will attack the player as well as monsters. When attacked, the game switches into combat mode. Fights are seen from a third person view; in combat mode, players only have two options - trust and parry.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Elvira II - The Jaws of Cerberus</title_clean>
			<plot>Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. [CR]Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). [CR]For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. [CR]As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. [CR]Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</plot>

			<title_clean>Emlyn Hughes Arcade Quiz</title_clean>
			<plot>Emlyn Hughes' Arcade Quiz is a game based on quiz machines found in bars and public houses. The idea is to move through ten mazes of blocks and reach the Win bar on the right of the screen. Be careful though, as the maze scrolls to the left and if your not quick enough you will reach the Lose bar on the left of the screen. You will encounter different types of blocks that will help or hinder you. These include Question blocks, get it right and you can move on, get it wrong and you have to answer another question meaning you slowly scroll towards the left of the screen. Money can also be collected to help stack up your total at the end of the level. Other blocks include a block that will block you for a certain time and a block that moves you in a random direction. When you reach the Win bar you enter a bonus game where on a time limit you have to answer as a number of questions based on how many coins you collected. Afterwards you have a choice to either cash in your money or move onto the next level which will cost you money to enter. Along with the main playing area, you can also see how much money you have and any bonuses collected.</plot>

			<plot>This adventure is licensed from an autobiography of the rather sordid life of Maryat Rollet-Andriane. It centres around a man's efforts to attract her - suffice to say, he doesn't do so by offering her a can of Pepsi, and the game is not aimed at the young or prudish. Most of the game involves using multiple-choice dialogue to produce the correct outcome. You will visit bars, beaches, and many glamorous cities. There are also several sub-games, as you visit a casino, fend off love rivals, and face down smugglers.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of Sega's most highly regarded Arcade games, Enduro Racer is a follow-up to Hang-On and focuses more on the stunts and jumps unique to motocross among all other forms of motorbike racing. Players must reach the finish line within the time limit, avoiding other players and obstacles and carefully navigating over each jump.Most home ports attempted to emulate the Arcade's ever-shifting 3D perspective to varying degrees of success depending on each respective system's graphical power.For the Sega Master System port, Enduro Racer is depicted from an isometric perspective and plays very differently. It does allow players to customize their vehicle with upgrades between each race, using points earned for how many vehicles they overtook. This would be the version that would later see a rerelease for Nintendo's Wii Shop, specifically the Virtual Console. Unfortunately, a lot of the content was removed for the US and international versions, including several tracks.[CR]Ending Credits[CR]The game contains a message for players once completing all of the stages in record time:Congratulations!You successfully completed all of the stages! "Enduro" is a symbolic journey through life via the media of race.The results are insignificant and what really counts is competing.Of particular importance are the lessons to be learned concerning one's self from the various encounters you experience along the way.There is no victor or loser in this test of endurance.The only thing that really matters is that you make a commitment to begin the long and trying trek.This game is then dedicated to all of the "Life riders" who have started out on the solitary trip to find their own individual limits.Last but not least, may we sincerely congratulate you on a perfect run.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>England Championship Special</title_clean>
			<plot>Featuring the English national squad in a top-down soccer game, England Championship Special represents British publisher Grand Slam's attempt to cash in on both England's respectable semi-final entry at the 1990 World Cup and the popularity of Anco's acclaimed Kick Off series.[CR]With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the "Championship Special" part of the title refers. The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match.[CR]While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn't buy the Euro Championship license. You'll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the "Champions of Europe" title in a nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals.[CR]Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at all.</plot>

			<plot>Years in the works and heavily inspired by Battlestar Galactica, this space opera game tells the story of the evacuation of mankind through the territories of the evil Rexxons. The game features eight levels of space flight action shooting. For instance navigate your vessel through a minefield within a timelimit. Or destroy the communication arrays of the Raxxons on the planet itself. Although gameplay is limited, the vector graphics are impressive and so are the cutscenes. You can look at your spacecraft from 6 diffent perspectives. The game is best played using the mouse. The action is viewed from the cockpit.[CR]</plot>

Remember, each shot lowers your ray power slightly so more powerful weapons can be lostTry to rescue all the hostages for a larger life bonus at the end of each levelDon't hang around in the Canal Zone, the time limit is very tightRemember two players means twice the firepower![CR]Theme &amp; Style[CR]Who will come to save Dr. Sarah Bellum?Escape from the Planet of Robot Monsters flaunts so much style and campy sci-fi clique it's hard not to love. From it's hard-as-snails space marines dressed in brightly coloured spadex jumpsuits, to the sexed up factory workers enslaved by the Evil Snake-ish Reptillions.Oozing this much sexual inuendo could easily have turned into an limp gimick quickly. Thankfully, EPRM backs-up it's digs at the sci-fi genre with some excellent Lichenstein inspired artistic style and an overall quality that will captivate the player till the game's climax.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Eskimo Games takes the winter sports multi-event format and emphasises the winter rather than the sports. Operation Snowball is similar to the arcade game Cabal insofar as it resembles Operation Wolf but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and destroy the shots they aim at you.[CR]Eggsterminator places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a birds nest. Birds will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds themselves causes you to fall and lose time. Ice NIgloos involves using your axe to collect ice, and taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you time.[CR]Miami Ice is a clone of Tapper, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles.[CR]The final event is not present on the C64. It is Barbearian, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.</plot>

The game can be viewed top-down (similar to the Kick Off games) or side-on (similar to Manchester United Europe). Three different passing modes are offered, with the aim of providing precise one-touch passing or the ability for long-range direct through-balls. The match options include 10 skill levels, variable wind, five different pitch conditions, and variable match lengths. You can play league and cup tournaments featuring up to 32 of the games teams, which are taken from the top clubs in top European countries.</plot>

			<plot>Tecmo's World Cup '90 arcade game was remodeled based on the 1992 European Championships for its home computer release. The tournament's structure of the time (2 groups of 4 play each other once, top 2 go through to semi-finals followed by a final) is recreated, with any of Europe's soccer nations available to be chosen as those 8, and 1 or 2 human players choosing their team, playing on either keyboard or joystick.[CR]The matches are played from a side-scrolling perspective. The ball sticks to the player's foot, and can be kicked or passed with a press of the fire button. The referee is fairly lenient when it comes to tough sliding tackles, although fierce contact will result in a free kick being given.</plot>

			<plot>This conversion of a Taito arcade game was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships. The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.[CR]Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</plot>

			<plot>Developed by the Late Jeremy C. Smith and Peter J. M. Irvin, Elite was way ahead of it's time both in innovation (foreshadowing Metroidvania and games such as Kirby and Prince of Persia 2008 with no Fail-States and in the sheer amount of features. In the mid 80s, action adventure games usually consisted of jumping platforms pits and monsters or the puzzles and platforming of games such as Thunderstruck and Dizzy. Exile loosely shared elements of the above, along with Thrust style physics (an earlier Lunar Lander type game by Jeremy)With the ability to fly, shoot or throw objects in practically any direction and the particle effects and physics involved, the roaming creatures which could follow you across the map (compared to simple back and forth movement of many games even well into the 16 bit era) as well as your (upgradeable) space suit having 4 pockets and the ability to remember 4 teleport destinations anywhere on Phoebus, how all this fit into The BBC/Acorn Electron's 32k (or even the 512k Amiga) is amazing.The game itself involved blasting your way into the mines, away from the harsh surface winds, encountering various forms of life such as the mischievous space imps and Maggots Triax experimented on, and the helpful Fluffy, exploring and solving physics based puzzles to find items including remote control devices (RCDs) to open doors and transporters, and whistles to control rogue robots, destroying or disabling turrets and doors and, eventually making your way to Triax.Since your thrusters and weapons all used the same energy capsules, and grenades were sparse trying to avoid combat and item conservation was important, but multiple solutions to some puzzles was possible, an early example being a small ship which had 2 grenades behind an explodable door, careful use of your first found grenade could get you both, at the risk of them being caught in the blast or if you were patient, one of the RCDs could open the door later on and get you both grenades without loss. Likewise you could shoot certain turrets or robots/creatures to gain energy capsules but the loss of energy via shooting or the loss of a grenade (and the risk that the unstable energy capsules would explode before you could pocket it had to be weighed up.Another early puzzle involved finding a flask and filling it with water from a pond to put out a fire surrounding the first RCD, but carrying the empty flask out of the small alcovein which it was first found would result in the door closing before you could leave, so you had to go halfway down the tunnel, where the door in question would automatically open, "remember" a teleport slot before entering the alcove, then throw the flask out and teleport back to catch it.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.[CR]This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available  this can only be done when no ball is active.[CR]Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally  simply pick up and place a generated fuse.[CR]Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.</plot>

			<plot>Extensor is a light cycle game played from a first person perspective. Taking place on the planet Spazm it sees the player competing in a futuristic sports tournament against a number of computer dromes. To win the game the player simply has to avoid crashing into walls or into his or his competitors' trails. In addition to the first person view that takes up most of the screen there is also a long range scan that shows an overview of the arena with the positions of all light cycles as well as a smaller top down view centred on the player.Before starting a game it can be customized in various ways. This include the speed of it, whether the speed should be constant or player controlled and how many AI controlled bikes should compete. Up to six AI bikes can be included and it's also possible to change their strategy (offensive or defensive). The pattern of the arena can also be selected, from no walls to a large amount of smaller obstacles. </plot>

			<plot>Of all the mundane tasks which've been turned into action-packed games, bug-repelling must be up there with being a Paper Boy or a Trashman. These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats and even toy tanks.[CR]You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.</plot>

			<title_clean>F-15 Strike Eagle</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]F-15 Strike Eagle is an F-15 flight simulator released in 1985 based on real life missions in which the F-15 flew. In the 70&#8217;s and early 80&#8217;s the plane was used during missions in the Middle East and Asia, where it was used to destroy both ground and air targets. The game was designed by Sid Meier with input from Air Force pilot John W. "Bill" Stealy in a custom language called SidTran. The game was developed by MicroProse and published by Amstrad CPC. The game was the first part of a trilogy consisting of: F-15 Strike Eagle II  F-15 Strike Eagle III It was later released again by ZX Spectrum in 1987 and again, in 1993, on the Game Boy and Game Gear. The game sold more than 1.5 million copies and was awarded Action game of the the Year in the same year it was first published.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game consists of 7 missions which have you fighting against the Libyan air force. The player starts each mission taking off from the U.S. Navy Carrier, the USS. Nimitz and flying against Libya and their Russian-built air force. The game has an arcade mode and 3 difficulty levels and features 3 types of both enemy aircrafts and SAMs. While playing, the pilot will have access to many tools available to modern pilots of the time including:Heads-Up DisplayComputer-assisted targetingAirborne radarGround tracking display mapsChaff and flares [CR]Game Features[CR]The PC version of the game included a method of DRM that required the player to use a decoder wheel to start the game. In later versions, players were able to use "Mission Codes" in order to continue from where they last left off. The later versions of the game also included a system that allowed the player to earn special rewards, promotions, and various medals for their action in combat. This was one of the first games to give a player access to chaff and flares. This game was also one of the first games to experiment with wire frame rotation. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>The second in the series features campaigns in Lybia, the Persian Gulf, The Middle East and Vietnam, making for a total of 250,000 miles of potential action and danger. Primary and secondary aerial and ground-based targets must be destroyed on each of these. You are armed with a cannon, AMRAAM long-range air-to-air missile, Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, and the Maverick air-to-ground missile.[CR]11 camera angles including internal and external views of the plane exist. To help new players there is a training mode, with options to disable crashes and automate take-off and landing. Enemy AI is responsive, but a targeting computer helps you take them out before they can do it to you. The game incorporates two "Director's Modes" which cuts away from your cockpit to highlight special events occurring elsewhere in the game world, like enemy base launching fighters, SAM sites launching SAMs, and your missiles hitting the target.</plot>

			<plot>Rule the night! Take the pride of American Stealth technology and take on the best the Warsaw pact technology can offer! Dodge between radars, sneak under enemy fighters, and take out your primary objectives and secondary objectives with your limited weapons onboard, then make your way home. Can you survive all the way to general and win the Congressional Medal of Honor?[CR]F-19 Stealth Fighter was based around Sid Meier's closest estimate of the stealth fighter based on the data available at the time. You get full 3D graphics, 3D enemies, random objectives and enemy dispositions (so each mission will be different), dynamic radar effectiveness that depends on your position and radar cross section, enemies that search you out if you do "tickle" their defenses, even civilian aircrafts in the air, and ability to play in cold war, moderate war, or all-out war, with very different rules of engagement.</plot>

			<plot>Set in the near future, players are assigned the latest in flight technology and four campaigns to play through - the testing range in Monument Valley, Arizona, and the war theatres in the Pacific, Europe and the Middle East with 99 missions in total, and multiple endings.The player gets to choose between two semi-fictional aircraft, the F29 and the F22, both based on design proposals for the Advanced Tactical Fighter validation program, a competition arranged by the United States Air Force in 1981 which concluded in 1991, the year after the game's release. Because the winner wasn't known when the game was made, the F22 depicted in the game does not look anything like the F22 Raptor design that won the competition and started production in 1997, but rather early proposals for the Lockheed YF-23 (the F22's primary competitor), and the F29 design was used as the X29 Experimental Aircraft in tests by NASA from 1984 to 1991, but was then retired.The cover art for re-prints of the game after 1991 features an aircraft that looks more like the actual F22, instead of the canard design of the original art, but the planes are still the same in-game.The Amiga version of the game was notoriously bad, having been rushed to the market with several major bugs and missing music. The PC version fared better, but had some odd issues - it could only be installed to the C:\RETAL folder, otherwise it wouldn't launch, and even then it required the presence of a floppy in the A: drive to save, it couldn't save progress to it's own install folder. The sound card detection was also inconsistent, sometimes it would launch without any sound at all, or with music but no digitized or Adlib synthesized sound effects, and unlike most other games of the time there was no sound setup program, so you had to rely on the game's automatic sound card detection.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>F1 Tornado is a flight combat game played from a first person perspective unlike the 8-bit game with the same name which is a side scrolling game. The game contains three dimensional vector graphics and the player takes control of the titular fighter plane in missions over the Persian Gulf and other locations.The aircraft moves forward by itself and the player's control is limited to steering, climbing, diving and shooting. When an enemy appears within the player's view the head on computer automatically locates it and locks on target and the player simply has to press the fire button to shoot it down. In additional to the primary machine gun attack there is also a missile attack that is initiated by holding down the fire button. Enemies includes most commonly aircrafts but also ground targets such as installations, tanks and gun emplacements. While playing it's necessary to keep track of the plane's damage and fuel levels. At times collectibles will appear and picking these up will recharge some of the fuel or repair some of the damage.</plot>

			<plot>The action in this ice hockey game is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective with a semi-3D effect. The puck loosely sticks to the player as he skates, and the netminders are CPU-controlled. Fights and penalties can be turned on or off, and the length of the match can be varied. [CR]As well as individual one or two player modes, a full managerial mode is included. This sees you take control of an international team and guide them through a full schedule of matches, including developing their skills and team-work.</plot>

			<plot>Fallen Angel is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Double Dragon. You play the fallen angel, sent on a mission to locate the leader of a drug distribution network. Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don't need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Federation Quest 1: BSS Jane Seymour (alternate title: Spacewrecked: 14 Billion Light Years From Earth) is a first-person sci-fi strategy action game. It was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1990.The player's goal is to search each individual ship (there are twenty in total) for a means to repair its core systems, before they are able to move onto the next. In order to repair the systems, they need to supply coolant (found in a lab) stored in flasks (manufactured in a special room) to each of the four rooms that separately control the four main computer systems. Attempting to stop them are the various environmental hazards such as radiation and lack of lighting/oxygen, the escaped alien specimens and the former crewmembers who have gone insane from sustained cryosleep.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Federation of free Traders</title_clean>
			<plot>Federation of Free Traders is a space simulation/exploration game that is quite similar to an earlier title, Elite. The player is able to zoom around in space while trading goods, undertake missions, or simply explore the galaxy (which consists of over 8 million planets). There is a significant amount of playable options in FOFT and a considerable attention is paid to detail. For instance, if the player becomes tired of roaming through outer space they skim a planet or two (which plays in a similar fashion to David Braben's other game, Virus).During the docking sequence players can create their own programs for automated functions, using a built-in BASIC like language called SIMPLE. </plot>

			<plot>Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.[CR]Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.[CR]On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</plot>

			<plot>With the full support of Scuderia Ferrari, Formula One racing was recreated in detail in this simulation, with the top drivers and teams of 1986 to compete against for the most successful F1 team of all. You job does not start at the racetrack; perfecting the car at the Maranello factory, in the wind tunnel to sort aerodynamics, and at the test track of Fiorano, is all required to get the most competitive car you can.[CR]You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tyre compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like. The action is viewed from inside the cockpit, with rear-view mirrors to help prevent collisions.</plot>

			<title_clean>Feudal Lords</title_clean>
			<plot>Feudal Lords is a turn-based strategy game set in the medieval kingdom Euthrania. Four lords, either controlled by human players or AI, fight for control over the kingdom. This is also the winning condition: getting all provinces into the own sphere of influence. Of course the lords also have a fair amount of management to think about, e.g. building up an army with different soldiers types, ensuring the kingdom's stability by taxing and trading and diplomacy to get the other lords off the back for a time. There are two options to overtake the kingdom: open war (sending an army to another province and the computer calculates the result) and behind-the-scenes plotting to start an uprising or order the assassination of the hostile lord. The game is completely menu based.</plot>

			<title_clean>Fiendish Freddy's Big Top 'O Fun</title_clean>
			<plot>In Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun the player must perform various circus acts, in a game play style not dissimilar to Konami's  Track and Field or Epyx's  California Games.  Acts in the game include the high wire, juggling, platform dive and human cannonball. Each act has progressive levels of difficulty. For instance, in the diving, the player must land in progressively smaller receptacles, the final part requiring successful navigation into a tea cup!  The controls and player input required change with each act.  The game was released across most 8-bit computer systems. The game was included as part of a bundle on some systems. On the Commodore 64 this came in the form of a 4 game cartridge bundled with later hardware releases. Fiendish Freddy shared the cart with  Klax, International Soccer, and  Flimbo's Quest.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Final Assault is a mountain climbing action/simulation game. The object of the game is to climb to the peak of a mountain via several different trails of varying difficulty. Progress is made in a fashion similar to that used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out, you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more luxuries such as extra rope.</plot>

			<plot>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.[CR]The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</plot>

It is a side-scrolling beat-em up with attacks consisting mainly of simple punching and kicking, as well as grabs, throws, aerial attacks and special moves which clear the area around the player while draining a small amount of health. Knives, swords and pipes can also be used. In the original arcade release, there are three playable characters: Cody, Haggar , and Guy.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Damnd Taunting HaggerThe story revolves around a street gang known as Mad Gear kidnapping Jessica, who is Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend. Instead of giving in to the gang, Haggar, Cody, and Cody's training partner, Guy, take to the streets of Metro City to destroy the gang and rescue Jessica. The player fights through the streets, through the subway system, through a wrestling ring, and eventually fight all the way the leader of the Mad Gear gang's mansion. The final boss is the leader of the Mad Gear gang on a wheelchair with Jessica on his lap rolling around and shooting the heroes with a crossbow. The trio eventually beat him out of his chair and kick him through the large window he is standing next to.[CR]Hardware[CR]An original Final Fight arcade machineFinal Fight was originally on Capcom's CPS arcade hardware. It featured a dedicated cabinet with a control panel that had two buttons and a 8-way joystick. Although three characters where selectable only two player could play at a single cabinet. Cabinet Colors varied but where typically black, with large character graphics where featured on the side.[CR]Ports Sequels and Emulation[CR]The SNES version of Final FightThe SNES version, released in North America in 1991, disappointed many because it dropped the co-op play, removing arguably the most attractive element of the game and it also removes Guy as a playable character. Though a second version was later released in 1994, called Final Fight: Guy, where Guy was a playable character and Cody was not. This version was available as a rental-only game from Blockbuster video stores.It was recently discovered that two variations of Final Fight: Guy exist- the common "orange box", and the rarer "black box." There is a lot of confusion as to where these black box version came from, and very few have ever been found. Theories express that it could have been the original color of the box until an exclusive deal was later made with Blockbuster or that it was a Canadian variant, despite it being marked as available in the US. This small variation can make these versions of the game very valuable from a collector's standpoint.Two sequels, Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3, were released on the SNES in 1993 and 1995, respectively.The game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as Final Fight One. Final Fight: One featured small dialog exchanges before boss fights, unlockable features, and the Street Fighter: Alpha versions of Cody ,and Guy.Final Fight: Double Impact was a PSN and XBLA game that was attached with Magic Sword.The game was also released as part of the 'Capcom Arcade' on iOS ( iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) in 2011.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]HaggarThe big slow strong character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the pipe, and has a piledriver and spinning lariat. He is the mayor of Metro City as well as Jessica's Father.CodyThe middle of the road character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the knife, he is the only character able to use the knife without throwing it. He uses a jumping spin kick, and is Jessica's boyfriend.GuyThe fast character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the Katana. He uses a jumping spin kick similar to Cody's. Guy is a friend of Cody's[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Metro City as it appears in Final Fight (CPS arcade version)There are six stages in the first Final Fight all taking place in Metro City.Stage one - SlumStage two - SubwayStage three - West SideStage four - Industrial AreaStage Five - Bay AreaStage six - Up TownBonus Stages:The first bonus stage takes place in a gas station in between level two and three, where the player destroys a thugs car as fast as they can within the time limit.The glass panes factory is the second bonus stage, it takes place between level five and six, where the player is to destroy all of the glass panes in the factory within the time limit.[CR]Boss Characters[CR]DamndDamnd is the first level boss, as well as the character that Haggar talks to in the attract screen.*In the SNES version his name was changed to Thrasher.SodomSodom is the Second level boss. He uses two swords that can be knocked out of his hands and used against him.

			<plot>In Fire! the player mans an advanced helicopter and tries to solve some of humanity's problems by shooting at them. The game consists of five thematically unrelated levels which consist of two stages each, e.g. in one mission the player has to destroy drug plants in South America and another one requires to deal with terrorists at sea. Regarding gameplay, this is a traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter: the player moves from left to right while shooting everything which moves. Shields and fuel are limited and if one reaches zero, the one and only life is lost. However, they can be refilled with power ups which are left behind from killed enemies. The standard gun can be either aimed straight or slightly downwards, but by picking up the correct power ups the weapon system can be upgraded.</plot>

			<plot>The background story of Fire &amp; Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed.  The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world. [CR]In this "jump &amp; run" you can also get some power-ups. You can find some coyote puppies; these puppies follow you, are invulnerable, and also shoot enemies. In higher regions you find some snow-flakes; enough of these and you get a great snowball for freezing more enemies on the screen.</plot>

			<plot>2160.  Beam technology, energy shields, and ground-skimming propulsion systems have revolutionized ground combat into high-speed, wide-ranging battles. World powers like the Pacific Combine and the European League spar and vie for territory with Grav tanks, striders, and Leviathans.  Take the role of a commander overseeing one of these skirmishes and match your tactical wits with the computer or another player.[CR]Firezone translates pen-and-paper, tactical wargaming to the computer screen.  Your primary view is a hex battle map with up to seven different types of terrain, showing stacks of infantry, artillery, armor, and command bases.    There is a structured turn sequence, with players alternating movement, fire, and retaliation.  The game stretches beyond a table-top wargame by allowing hidden units and providing a map-editor with which to create your own scenarios (nine are included).</plot>

			<plot>In First Contact, a communication space station is overrun by aliens. The player takes control over the maintenance droid with the goal to keep the station running as long as possible. The aliens will destroy vital part of the station and the droids need to repair them. There are also other important tasks like getting repairing equipment out of lockers or refueling.The player does not control the droid directly, but programs a script which is then performed independently. If the droid is interrupted, they stop the program and don't fight back. It has to be manually restarted by the player. To be more effective, the droid can be split into three droids with different abilities which have to be programmed individually. The game ends when all droids are disabled by the aliens, but if only one or two are down they can be repaired. There are four decks which can be reached through teleports.</plot>

			<plot>If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training.  Whether or not they actually got the approvalremember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new groundthey attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.[CR]This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. [CR]The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.[CR]Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.</plot>

			<title_clean>Flight of the Intruder</title_clean>
			<plot>Set in Vietnam, during Operation Linebacker in 1972, Flight of the Intruder lets the player pilot the F-4 Phantom II and A-6 Intruder through 13 campaign missions, or take the role of an Air Group Commander with the ability to create (and fly) their own missions. The missions are played alongside up to 7 AI wing men (4 of each aircraft type), and the player can switch between the planes at will, as well as select their loadouts in the pre-mission briefing. At the games harder difficulty levels the the player would have to worry about the reliability of the plane and it's weaponry - the F-4 would not have an internal cannon, and would have to rely on heat seeking and radar guided missiles that were prone to misfire, as well as an engine creating a visible smoke trail that would alert enemies. On the hardest difficulty the player would also have to follow basic rules of engagement. There were - as per usual for flight simulators at the time - several difficulty levels and an easily accessible cheat menu that would allow the player to make the plane invincible or have unlimited ammunition.There was a non-advertised serial port based multi-player mode included in the game, where one player would be able to fly the MiG's (otherwise not accessible to the player) in head to head combat.The game was in production before the novel's publication. Mirrorsoft obtained permission to use Coonts' name after the novel was a success, and the book was bundled with most releases of the game. He also wrote the introduction to the manual.Rereleases after 1991 generally used the same cover art as the movie.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Flimbo's Quest was a 2D platform/adventure game in which you take control of                             Flimbo, and quest through 7 levels to save your girlfriend                           Pearly (she's been                              kidnapped by  mad scientist                            Franzs Dandruff).The levels were not constantly scrolling to the right, a la                              Super Mario, but could be traversed left and right to search for scrolls needed to progress to the next level.  The number of scrolls required to complete a level increased each time you progressed.  The scrolls were located inside certain enemies in the game, destroying the enemy allowed you to collect it's scroll. Taking them all to the wizard                          Dazz Bazian would enable him to create the spell that would take you to the next level.Certain items could also be bought from Dazz Bazian to help the player through the level. These included extra time and lives, scrolls (so that you could 'skip' searching for one), and perhaps most importantly, a powered up weapon, which made tackling adversaries significantly easier. Coins to purchase these items could be found throughout the levels. There were also coin rooms, where, if the coins were collected in the correct order, larger amounts to spend could be amassed.Whilst the game was not long, it was addictive in its simple gameplay and could at times prove to be very difficult (sometimes due to lousy controls).

			<plot>Flip-it &amp; Magnose, the title characters of this action game with strong puzzle elements, live on Mars. Unfortunately the planet has not exactly the biggest water resources of the universe and so they are sent to Earth to get some. In the vertically scrolling platform levels the player has to solve puzzles by collecting objects and using them at the right place respectively giving them to the right people. However, the water is not given directly, but there is a water drop which has to be caught by using the water catcher object. The goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of water within the time limit.The player character can't die, but loses fruit when he falls too much of a distance. Fruit can be collected when wandering through the levels and are used between the six levels to buy traps which have different effects (and of course different prices), e.g. wasting a bit of time or reversing the controls. This is useful because the two Martians don't work together and try to beat each other's water score. There are also other items to collect which are not directly related to puzzle solving, like a spring for long jumps and objects which help against special hazards in the level. Collecting pills is a bit of a gamble because they can either add or subtract points on the water or fruit counter. The game uses a split-screen; one half for each Martian. In two-player games, the second Martian is controlled by player two.</plot>

			<plot>On Quiffy's journey he was charged with collecting up the litter found in the caves, and could only progress to the exit once the level was clean.  However, Quiffy couldn't stand still for too long, a ghost of Quiffy's dead Aunt would trace his path through the level, killing him if they touched.    Levels slowly filled with water from a number of running taps.  Levels would fill realistically, with water building and flowing into new spaces and creating air pockets. Quiffy could collect a variety of weapons, including grenades, dynamite, a boomerang, a flamethrower, and shuriken, and required oxygen tanks to exist underwater for longer than a few seconds.  The game had a perverse sense of humour, with bizarre teddy bear enemies, and the risk of weapons turning into rubber chickens at random intervals. In a distinctly 80's attempt at copy protection, Flood was issued with a poster, and the game asked a random question about the content of the poster.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Football Director II is the successor of Football Director, slightly extending the gameplay of the predecessor. Still, you are managing a football team in England, but you can start now with a top division team. For more challenge, you can also start with a small team in league 4 and fight your way to the international competitions.Managing a club starts with the staff, you can hire and sack coaches, physios and scouts. You can trade players, if there are any good offers on the market. Building stands helps to increase funds, as well as negotiating contracts to save some money. You get some statistics of your performance, can build up a youth team, set extra training if the team is not performing too well.The games themselves are not playable, you just see information about goals and cards and can get some more information after the game to make your conclusions what to change.</plot>

			<plot>Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.[CR]You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.[CR]There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to 8000 a time can be won on this.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Forgotten Worlds is a  side-scrolling, 360-degree rotatable shooter that was released on multiple platforms in the late 1980s and early 90s. It features two floating soldiers sent to an alien planet to defeat a being known as  Bios. The game was originally known as Lost Worlds in Japan. It is also known for being the first Capcom Arcade game to use their CPS-1 board.Forgotten Worlds was originally released in the Arcades on July 1988. It would quickly be adapted for the home computer market, such as the Amiga, C64 and Atari ST, by US Gold. Other console versions would follow, including a Master System and Genesis version by Sega and a TurboGrafx-CD version by NEC Interchannel. It was recently rereleased on  Wii  Virtual Console in North America on November 17, 2009.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The player is taken the role of Zak, a prisoner in a planetary prison called &#8220;Waste&#8221;, and of course, you have to escape. Stealing a space craft, you fight your way through the guarding forces.Foundations Waste is a vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up, in which you have to collect extra weapons, like a side shot, shields, a drone which can be controlled by the inverse control of the player ship and some kind of seeking missiles. Sometimes the power ups are fakes, inverting your control or slowing your ship down. You loose all extra weapons either on dying or on entering a new level.The enemy forces are tanks, ships, flying vessels and later even space ships. Each level is featuring an end-of-level guard, which can be destroyed for extra points, but can even passed if your fire-power is too low at that moment.</plot>

			<plot>Sir Fred was a brave and noble knight in love with a beautiful damsel, but evil Ultimor, an ugly dwarf with magical powers, casted a spell upon him and minimized to the size of the dwarf. Enemies were laughing at him, and other dwarfs were attacking him. What he should do? Yes, he should find and defeat Ultimor, return his size to be brave and noble enough, and to win back his belle.[CR]The gameplay flows in 2D side-scrolling mode, where you may use your sword, throw the daggers, and avoid the enemies. You may walk, jump and run, and perform this not in one plane. Background, foreground and middle planes are available to change. The daggers should be thrown to eliminate as enemies with range weapons as flying and hard-to-reach ones. Different items should be collected such as keys, other daggers, etc. [CR]There are several themed levels such as forest, grotto, castle, etc. in the game. To finish the level you should find the key and proceed with it to the entrance of next level. Your energy is represented by apples, and you should collect them also. Sometimes magic star appears on the level. It should be destroyed to eliminate all visible enemies. Magic potions are also differ either to give invincibility or to restore your energy.</plot>

			<plot>The Earth has been under siege by evil aliens from the planet MOZONE for centuries. The planet can not be saved - it's time to find a new home for humanity. A heavily armed ship is sent ahead to scout for such a place - naturally, lots of MOZONE ships stand in the way.[CR]Frenetic is a traditional vertically scrolling shoot'em'up. The action moves through eight levels, set both in space and on the ground (with such environments as a jungle planet and a water world). While most levels have a technological theme, some feature organic enemies and backgrounds, reminiscent of games like R-Type or Xenon 2. Going with tradition, each level has a huge end boss.[CR]The player's ship can collect a variety of power-ups: lasers and missiles, shooting to the front, the back or the sides. Speed-ups and shields are also available. Power-ups are revealed by destroying certain enemies or special bonus capsules, and several are given to the player for free at the start of a level. The weapons can be upgraded by collecting the same power-up several times.[CR]The game features a two-player mode, with two ships moving against the aliens at the same time.</plot>

			<plot>In Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun the player must perform various circus acts, in a game play style not dissimilar to Konami's  Track and Field or Epyx's  California Games.  Acts in the game include the high wire, juggling, platform dive and human cannonball. Each act has progressive levels of difficulty. For instance, in the diving, the player must land in progressively smaller receptacles, the final part requiring successful navigation into a tea cup!  The controls and player input required change with each act.  The game was released across most 8-bit computer systems. The game was included as part of a bundle on some systems. On the Commodore 64 this came in the form of a 4 game cartridge bundled with later hardware releases. Fiendish Freddy shared the cart with  Klax, International Soccer, and  Flimbo's Quest.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Frontier - Elite II</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frontier: Elite II was the sequel to the seminal Elite and furthered the ambition of an open ended space trading game. The sequel brought with it markedly improved physics and a realistically modelled galaxy. To augment the open-ended nature of the game the universe was procedurally generated and real sized planets despite there being little to explore on them.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Whilst no plot emerges during gameplay there is a plot present in the manual which sets the premise of the game. Fresh from victory in the Thargoid War during the original game humanity finds itself in crisis. With the Thargoids retreated to their own territory humanity has fallen into a cold war between the militaristic Federation and the slave owners of the Imperial Fleet. After a short war a tense ceasefire is in effect made worse by new anarchic systems taking advantage of the fear of military action by operating without law. You enter the world as always with 100 credits and a ship as the original protagonists grandchild, with no alliances to the factions and a chance to carve your own path in the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Changes from EliteWhilst Elite restricted you to one ship, Frontier: Elite II encouraged purchase of new ships to suit your style of play. Military vessels ranged from light fighter crafts to mammoth naval style crafts with trading crafts offering larger cargo space and mining crafts coming with specific mining lasers. Graphics are understandably improved with texture mapping and curved polygons moving the series from the simplistic wireframe style of the original. FactionsThe game has two primary factions which players may join. The Federation based on Earth and The Empire based in the Achenar system. Progress through both involved completing missions given at bases which allowed for promotions. The reality was that there was little gameplay difference between the two aside from the location of the base and how that would affect trade routes. The Empire was more permissive of slavery allowing for new trading opportunities whilst slavery was an arrestable offence in Federation territories. Certain ships were also designated as being independent, Federation or Empire ensuring they were out of bounds to those in an opposing faction. Finally upon joining a faction it locked off the enemies portion of space due to enemies becoming hostile upon spotting you. ControlUnlike Elite, whose controls were arcade style, Frontier opted for a rigid Newtonian physics model making flight control and dogfights highly difficult. In moving momentum had to be considered as did gravitational pull. Whilst difficult this did offer emergent gameplay such as using planets to slingshot great distances (not programmed in but emergent through the physics model). This put control closer to a flight simulator than the arcades. Making gameplay approachable despite these difficulties was done in two ways. Firstly long distance travel is done by use of the hyperdrive which makes long distance travel extremely quick and day to day such as docking and navigating to positions for using the hyperdrive can be handed to the autopilot. Earning CreditsThe game starts you with one hundred credits and an Eagle Long Range Fighter, setting you loose on an open ended universe. As with Elite the game concerns engaging in legal or illegal trading to earn credits and advance in whatever fashion the player desires. The game revolves around finding the most profitable trading routes and running them to earn maximum credits. Trading can be done by simply purchasing from ports or by mining asteroids however the cost of a mining vessel does restrict that aspect of the game until later levels. Certain items are deemed illegal in various ports and planets (such as narcotics) with the reward of lucrative black market trading being offset by the risk of police intervention. Again though black market trading involves a certain amount of investment (life support for cargo bay to transport slaves for example) which limits it to a more advanced player. Beyond trading bounty hunting and military missions can both be highly profitable but come with inherent risks. Bounty hunting taking you into anarchic systems and to highly dangerous ships with military missions raising your rank by allying you to a faction and to a set of solar systems whilst making you unwelcome in others. BugsRushed for release in the UK for Christmas 1993 the game was filled with bugs. These ranged from inconsistencies between the booklet and the game (with regards to ship details) to incorrect prices paid for gems in the Cemiess system making trading there almost game-breakingly lucrative. The only bug which required a patch however was the "mining glitch" where attempting to leave equipment in a system ended in a crash. The most famous of bugs however is the wormhole bug which exploited a maths overflow in calculating hyperspace distances. In essence is the jump distance was exactly 655.36 light years the game would allow a jump regardless of ship capabilities. This was removed for the versions released after 1993 however it has made the freeware UK version the most popular. Moving away from bugs large portions of the game seemingly suffers from it's ambition by showing a lack of polish. Ships such as "The Lion" cannot handle having turrets installed as it simply fires into it's own wing and missiles being largely unable to damage crafts. Whilst minor there are instances of this lack of polish impacting strongly on gameplay as can be seen by the police AI being astonishingly poor resulting in police chases being impossible due to the police crafts crashing into each other almost instantly.

[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]The only sequel received was Frontier: First Encounters which launched for the PC in 1995 to mixed reviews due to its premature release drawing criticism of it being half finished. A proposed modern iteration named Elite 4 was planned and down as being under development on the Frontier Developments website but was never shown. On November 5th 2012 Frontier Development launched a Kickstarter to help fund development of Elite: Dangerous, a sequel in the genre and spirit of the original games for release in 2014. The project achieved it's goal and raised over &#163;1.5 million in funding.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Tie-in of the rather unknown but truly brilliant board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.[CR]This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers... if it wasn't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in.[CR]The computer game is an extremely accurate conversion of the board game - virtually every aspect has been taken care of.[CR]What's especially refreshing about this game is that it does not rely on luck - it's pure strategy. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something inbetween) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</plot>

			<plot>One of the first Speedball clones takes the basic court layout of basketball as its inspiration. There are 5 players on each team, on a small court with 2 and 3 point shooting areas. The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.</plot>

			<plot>The Citizens Defence Force does not trust the United Nations to keep a troubled 21st century world at peace. It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently.The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with &#8216;up&#8217; referring to &#8216;climb&#8217; or &#8216;dive&#8217;, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves &#8211; this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</plot>

The sports simulation boasts an impressive variety of diciplines, divided into three sections:Track and Field: running, relay, hurdles, steeplechase, discus, shot putt, hammer throw, javelin, long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault;Water Sports: free style, breast stroke, back stroke, butterfly, relay, diving;Fighting: boxing, wrestling, judo, fencing.Eliminating the different distances in single events (such as 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle), though, The Games' "over 30 events" melt down to 22; and counting only those which differ to some degree in their execution, it boils down to six: running, throwing, jumping, swimming, diving and fighting.The Games '92 is divided in three parts: During preparation time, manage and train twelve athletes by sentencing them to gym time and daily practice. Game time advances with each action until the olympic games begin.In pactice, heats and finals, you take control of your athletes and drive them to peak performances through rhythmical tapping of the cursor keys, and the occasional press of the space bar.In the database section, you can read up on previous games and winning athletes, and take a look at Barcelona location maps.</plot>

			<plot>Gary Linekers Superskills is a soccer game with a catch: it is only about the training! The player has to solve a sequence of mini games in a limited amount of time (overall). The mini games are divided into three basic categories: gym (button mashing), ball juggling (using moves with the right timing) and field event. The latter is also split into three succeeding disciplines: dribbling around obstacles, penalty and kicking the ball through hung up tyres.It is important to monitor the athlete's pulse rate and energy level which can be refreshed by either taking a rest or drinking. The game automatically does it for the player if the stats get too low, but it takes more time then. The game features three difficulty levels which can be assigned separately for each participant.</plot>

			<title_clean>Gauntlet III - The final Quest</title_clean>
			<plot>Like in the prequels you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment.[CR]These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.[CR]The big difference is the graphics. While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has an isometric kind of view.[CR]The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.</plot>

			<plot>Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.[CR]The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). [CR]Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).</plot>

			<plot>Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it's down to the protagonist to clear up a situation scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion.Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.</plot>

			<title_clean>Germ Crazy</title_clean>
			<plot>In Germ Crazy, you play the part of a fledgling surgeon who must protect his patient from a debilitating, flesh-eating virus. The disease must be stopped by whatever means necessary; whether by antibody injections, black market drugs, amputation, or all-out germ warfare. Just be sure that your patient doesn't suffer too much surgical abuse or else he will be greeted by Mr. Grim Reaper himself. On the flipside, being too careful may result in the rapid spreading of this hideous mutant virus, and the poor victim will literally rot away until all that remains is a skeleton![CR]The gameplay is complex and unique, and resembles a more biological version of Sim City. There are six levels of difficulty, but even at the easiest level, Germ Crazy is a difficult game to master. The subject matter, although undeniably grim, is tempered with a sadistic sense of humor throughout.</plot>

Spanning five short yet brutally difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like Shadow of the Beast and Ghosts 'n' Goblins.[CR]A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, Ghost Battle casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sir Arthur with Princess Prin PrinGhosts 'N Goblins (known in Japan as Makaimura, translated to Hell Village) is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed and released by Capcom in arcades on September 17, 1985. Players control a knight (named Sir Arthur) who must battle legions of demons, ghosts, and other undead creatures in order to save Princess Prin Prin from Satan, King of the Demon World.Known for its unrelenting difficulty, the game was later ported to various systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (by Micronics), Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, IBM PC compatibles, Sharp X68000, and Game Boy Color. The game received numerous sequels (maintaining the platforming feel of the original) and spinoffs (such as the Gargoyle's Quest and Maximo series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur starts the game with the lanceGhosts 'N Goblins is a side-scrolling action game with platforming elements. The game has six stages with a boss at the end of each stage. Upon completion of all six stages, the player has to repeat all six stages again with increased difficulty before finally beating the game. There are five weapons in the game: Axe, Dagger, Lance, Torch, and Shield. Sir Arthur starts the game with the lance, but can pick up other weapons as they are dropped by enemies. Enemies include zombies, red demons, dragons, ogres, and other monsters. The shield must be equipped to enter the final stage and complete the game.Ghosts 'N Goblins is often regarded as one of the hardest games ever made. It only takes two hits from any attacking foe for Arthur to die, and considering the player's supply of just 3 lives, completing Ghosts 'N Goblins is considered to be very difficult. There are, however, ways of improving both the quality of Arthur's armor and how many extra lives he has. Better armor can be found throughout the game in a few hidden locations. The extra lives are earned by first scoring 20,000 points, then 70,000 points. Thereafter, the player gains a new life for every additional 70,000 points they earn.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]WeaponDescriptionLanceThe Lance is Sir Arthur's starting weapon. It travels in a straight line and will go off the screen unless it connects with an enemy.KnifeThe Knife works similarly to the lance in the sense that it travels in a straight line and will go off the screen unless it connects with an enemy. The main difference is that it travels at a faster speed than the lance, but is weaker.TorchThe Torch, when thrown, travels in an arc and when it strikes the ground fire is emitted that damages enemies who touch it making it a powerful weapon. However, only two can be thrown at a time.AxeThe Axe travels in an arc similar to the torch and only two can be thrown at a time. The difference is that it can pass through enemies and doesn't emit fire on the ground. The axe is considered to be the worst weapon in the game due to the awkward throwing arc and its property to pass through enemies is not very useful.ShieldThe shield travels in a straight line like the lance and knife, but has a very limited range. However, it can destroy any enemy projectiles it collides with making it very useful. This weapon must be equipped to be able to enter the final stage.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts in an action-platforming game originally published in 1988 by Capcom for arcades. The game has since been ported to several home computers and consoles. It is the second entry in the notoriously-difficult Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. Three years after Sir Arthur rescues his true love Princess Prin Prin from the evil Astaroth, Lucifer (or Loki in some versions) brings forth an army of macabre minions and steals the  souls of several helpless victims; among the souls stolen is that of Arthur's beloved. Once again, Arthur dons his trusty armor to fight the demonic hordes and rescue these lost souls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur unleashes Thunder MagicGhouls 'N Ghosts gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, but with a few notable exceptions. Arguably the most significant addition is Arthur's new ability to fire any weapon vertically up or down. Most of the original game's weapons are present and a few new weapons have been added, as well as a new set of magically-infused Golden Armor. When equipped, the Golden Armor allows Arthur to charge his current weapon to perform a powerful magic attack. Each weapon has its own unique magic, save for the Psycho Cannon.Weapons &amp; Magic Lance - Fires a lance in a straight line. Thunder Magic fires a powerful magic bolt vertically from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right. This weapon is called "Sword" in some versions. Sword - A strong melee-only weapon that is swung in a short arc. Thunder Dragon Magic unleashes a flaming dragon upward that attacks sky-bound enemies. This weapon is called "Super Sword" in some versions. Axe - Hurls an axe in a straight line. This weapon can penetrate objects, but has a slow rate of fire. Exploding Magic summons several large explosions around Arthur's position.Torch - Lobs a torch in a short arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Fireball Magic creates four fireballs that swirl outward from Arthur's left and right sides. This weapon is called "Fire Water" in some versions.Discus - Fires a bladed disc in a straight line which will follow the contour of any platforms on contact. Firing while crouching causes the disc to move along the ground's surface. Mirror Magic creates a temporary protective shield ahead of Arthur's position.Dagger - Fires a dagger in a straight line. This weapon is comparatively weak, but it also has the fastest rate of fire in the game. Double Magic creates an invulnerable shadow clone of Arthur that mimics his movement and attacks for a short time.Psycho Cannon - Only available on the second playthrough. Fires a blast of powerful magic in a straight line for a short distance. This weapon cannot be charged, although its range is increased while wearing the Golden Armor.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts WorldThe game features five Stages, each of which is split into two distinct areas by a checkpoint.Stage OneThe Execution Place, a mass grave at the edge of the Demon Realm, is where Arthur begins his long quest; however, the murderous skeletons, swooping vultures and hair-trigger guillotines located here will attempt to bring his adventure to a very sudden end. This area is also a tribute to the first Stage of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins, complete with remixed music. The Stage's second half at the Floating Island on the Lake features strong winds that slow movement to a crawl. Past the island's poisonous forest, a giant demon known as Shielder protects the exit by spitting fireballs.Stage TwoA constant stream of demonic turtles bounce down the slope leading to the The Village of Decay, a destroyed human settlement. After crossing a gigantic ant lion pit, Arthur is ambushed by an upgraded version of Firebrand known as the Red Arremer King. Further ahead, earthquakes and demonic flames plague the Town of Fire, a sweltering ruin terrorized by the hell-hound Cerberus.Stage ThreeArthur finds himself riding a treacherous elevator up through Baron Rankle's Tower; quick movements are required to avoid being crushed against the ceiling in this auto-scrolling area. At the peak of the Horrible-Faced Mountain, Arthur boldly leaps across the outstretched tongues of several demonic statues before battling a living storm cloud called Gassuto.Stage FourGiant bones litter the floor of The Crystal Forest, a cave system leading directly into Lucifer's castle. At the halfway point, Arthur descends down the slippery slopes of The Rotting Grotto, stepping across several man-eating plants to land on the back of Ohme, a gigantic immobile worm infested with smaller creatures that collectively act as the Stage boss.Stage FiveIf pain was like food, then Lucifer's Castle of Evil Demons would be a feast. The entryway swarms with skeletal dragons and a gauntlet of four Red Arremer Kings as an appetizer. After climbing an ominous spiked ladder, Arthur does battle with Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins. Once Astaroth is dispatched, Arthur is assaulted by two Shielder heads attached to the walls of the next room. Twin Astaroths flank Arthur for a surprise rematch further ahead, followed by a trio of Gassutos. Past one final Shielder head and a legion of demonic insects, Beelzebub guards the Stage exit.After completing this Stage, Arthur receives a message that he cannot defeat Lucifer without the Psycho Cannon, a weapon blessed by the goddess of battle. In the series' tradition, Arthur is sent back to the first Stage, where players must complete the full game a second time. While wearing the Golden Armor, players can discover the Psycho Cannon in certain treasure chests on the second playthrough.Final Boss: LuciferThe enormous Lord of Hell sits atop his throne, firing lasers from his mouth and hands and stomping his feet in a last-ditch attempt to exterminate Arthur. However, his evil strength is no match for the power of the Psycho Cannon, which Arthur uses to destroy Lucifer once and for all before reuniting with Princess Prin Prin.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Goal takes the basic gameplay of Dino Dini's previous Kick Off games, but updates most features in some way. The control is loose, making it tricky to keep the ball while dribbling, and holding down fire when the ball is at your feet will trap it, allowing you to pass it more easily.[CR]Teams from various European countries are included, and you can customise these by moving players around, and changing the starting lineups and formations. An Arcade Challenge mode sees you play matches against each of the 5 computer team speeds, in succession, until you lose one - you can also arrange leagues or play individual matches.[CR]A wide range of options are included, with variable wind settings, a range of pitches and referees, variable match lengths, and the chance to play up/down or left/right, a choice of close or distant view, and variable computer speed and skill (these can be combined to vary the game quite significantly).</plot>

			<title_clean>Gods</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The seventh game from prolific Amiga/Atari ST developers The Bitmap Brothers, Gods is an action-platformer game in which the hero Hercules must defeat four evil guardians in order to be granted his immortality by the Greek Gods.The game employs a variable AI that increases or decreases in severity dependent on how well the player is performing. Playing badly will cause less enemies to appear and more bonuses to be awarded, while surviving for a long time might increase enemy aggression to compensate. Hercules can collect treasure and use it to buy useful power-up items from vendors accessible at the end of every area. Many enemies constantly respawn, so the player is recommended to move quickly through the maze-like stages, though some strategy is required due to the number of key puzzles to solve.Gods is scored by synth musician John Foxx, and the striking box art illustration (as seen on European versions of the game) was created by English comic book artist Simon Bisley.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,7,5,6 saying, "...faithful to the original and even better as a SNES cart. The strategy aspect is a definite plus especially with the hidden rooms and intricate puzzles. The pseudo artificial intelligence for the skill level is cool and works quite well".[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Gold of the Realm</title_clean>
			<plot>A dying man is found on your doorstep. He hands you a map and in his dying breath, tells of a great treasure of gold located in one of four castles built by the Four Princes of the Realm. Although deserted for many years now, the gold still remains, along with only a few evil things and remnants of sorcery that watch over the treasure.[CR]You remember a tale your grandfather has told of a disguised evil magician who had won the favor of the Four Princes and would serve as the Court Magician. They would later trust him to hide away the Realms riches within the Gray Castle, protected by his magic. But, once the gold was in his grasp, the magician rose up against the Princes, casting them out of the castles with powerful spells of magic. Legend also says demons rose up to destroy any that remained in the land, especially each of the Princes of the Realm. Very few survived to tell the tale. With only your work horse as company you leave on your quest. [CR]At the start of this game of exploration, you have a choice of difficulty, Easy, Medium, and Hard. The Easy level has one castle to explore with 79 different screens. The Medium level has two castles, and 159 different screens. The Hard level has four castles and 320 different screens. Each increased level of difficulty has more foes and obstacles to overcome, and more items to find. In addition, the Hard selection will randomize certain items and conditions giving 4096 possible games, which effectively makes Gold of the Realm always different whenever you start a new game.[CR]Make your way through the castles by picking up items and using them when necessary. Pick up items by standing over the item and pressing the joystick button. The name of the item and its image will appear in the Status Bar. To use an item or drop an item from your inventory, its name must be showing in the Status Bar indicating that it is the current item. To drop an item, stand on a blank area of floor and press the joystick button once. (Items can only be dropped on wooden floors). [CR]Avoid being touched by a spook - they will steal your current item and drop it somewhere in the Realm. Doors can be opened by standing near them and pressing the joystick button. Move up and down staircases by standing on the steps and pressing the joystick button. [CR]Map and save often to succeed on your quest. If you have defeated all obstacles, and have the treasure, go back to your horse, and press the joystick button.</plot>

			<title_clean>Golden Axe</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Golden Axe is side-scrolling hack and slash game developed by Sega and released in 1989 as an arcade game. It was later ported to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, as well as a few other platforms including Xbox Live Arcade on July 11, 2007.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]An evil being known as Death Adder has taken over the once peaceful land called Yuria. Having murdered many innocent people, he also captured the king and his daughter. Death Adder's coup de gr&#226;ce was finding the magical emblem of the land, the Golden Axe. And unless the people of Yuria accept him as the land's new king, he promises to destroy it.Starting the game requires players to select one of three characters, each of which is filled with revenge. While all three share the same goal of saving the king and his daughter, and stopping Death Adder from destroying the Golden Axe, each one has individual ambitions as well.Gilius Thunderhead - a battleaxe-wielding dwarf whose twin brother was killed by Death Adder's henchmen. His heart is filled with hate for the evil being.Ax Battler - a barbarian who wields a two-handed broadsword, his desire to stop Death Adder fueled by the hatred he feels for him, because the evil being killed his mother.Tyris Flare - a longsword-wielding amazon, she wants revenge on Death Adder for the murder of both of her parents.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Story modeTo advance through the game, players must fight through swarms of Death Adder's henchmen, including mace-wielders, giants, and barbarians riding dragons and other mythical creatures. Killing a henchman mounted on one of these creatures affords players the opportunity to ride it as well.Players possess the ability to cast magic spells, which require magic potions obtained by kicking small, strange-looking thieves. More magic potions equal more devastating magical attacks. Picking up meat by kicking thieves helps recover lost health on the health bar.It is also possible to play through the game cooperatively with a second player.Duel modeDuel mode was implemented in many of the ports, but it was never included in the original arcade version. In Duel mode, players must fight through a number of small stages. Each stage has a handful of enemies to defeat. Defeat all the enemies to advance to the next stage.Duel mode can be played with two players, but it changes the goal entirely. The two players will have to fight each other to see who is crowned best warrior.[CR]Port Differences[CR]The Genesis is considered the most faithful port, visually and gameplay-wise. The DOS port for PCs is based directly on the Genesis port, and is almost as faithful in terms of aesthetics when playing in VGA mode.When the game was ported to the Genesis, Sega added one extra level that takes place right after the players defeat Death Adder. Where the arcade version ends right then and there, in the Genesis version, the large dungeon doors in the background of the level open and the characters walk inside. The final level takes place in this dungeon, after which the players face a new final boss called Death Bringer.As mentioned prior, Duel Mode was a new addition to the Genesis port of the game.In the Genesis port, when enemies are defeated, they flash and disappear as opposed to turning to stone.Some of the more graphics-intensive varieties of spell effects did not make it over to the home ports of the game. For instance, when Ax Battler is carrying his maximum capacity of potions, the spell he unleashes in the arcade version features a mushroom cloud emanating from the floor with huge rocks erupting towards the screen. In the DOS version, this high-level spell merely looks like a series of small eruptions scattered around the screen. The Genesis version aims to replicate the spell more effectively, but the rocks are smaller and they spit out to the side rather than scaling towards the screen.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Y'n Hsi is a Buddhist monk whose father was murdered by a warlord called Ch'un Kuei. In order to defeat the tyrant and regain his family's palace, he must tread the golden path, the road to transcendence.[CR]The Golden Path is a point and click adventure game. Instead of using verbs like in Maniac Mansion, the player controls the monk with the mouse by moving a cursor shaped like a Chinese letter and clicking directly at him on the screen. Left-clicking on a spot on the ground moves the monk towards it. Left-clicking below Y'n Hsi makes him bend over to drop or pick objects on the ground. Left-clicking above his head makes him try to use the object he is holding at the moment (if it is not possible to do so, a question mark appears). Right-clicking makes him punch and kick, his defense against enemies. Every time the monk is hit, the inventory briefly flashes. A book sits at the bottom-left of the screen, and serves as a hint system of sorts. When clicking on it, a message about the screen appears with explanations to events, characters and objects. Besides the book is the inventory with four slots for objects. Left-clicking on an object places it on Y'n Hsi hands. Above the inventory is a slowly withering vine as the energy bar. It grows with the completion of certain tasks. [CR]The main objective is to follow the golden path. Literally. On the bottom-right of the screen there is a small version of the main game screen that shows the path and its bifurcations. The character moves from screen to screen collecting things laying around, fighting the occasional enemy and using the right object at the right place.[CR]Pressing S saves the game, while typing L loads it.</plot>

			<plot>In Goldrunner, a vertically scrolling shooter, earth has to be evacuated because of the damage caused by environmental pollution. Unfortunately the space ships have to pass through the world of Triton - and the inhabitants are unfriendly. So the obvious solution is to destroy the rings, huge space stations. A full frontal attack is without a change of success because the rings have to be destroyed from within. So the player is chosen to man a small space ship to do the job.Every ring has a certain amount of energy which has to be reduced by destroying everything inside. Of course the Tritons won't give up without a fight, but touching the enemies won't hurt the space ship (it hurts them): the only way to die is by touching enemy mines (the ship can take up to five hits) or by flying against a high, indestructible building (instant death).  The ship also has a turbo boost function and between levels there are bonus rounds which are used to rack up points for the high score list. </plot>

			<plot>Although Graham Taylor was the England international football manager at the time this game was released, the player starts a management career managing in Division 3 of the league, and have to work your way up, either by improving your squad (much as Taylor did in his successful spell with Watford, who he took from the 4th tier of English football to the top division and the FA Cup Final) or by doing well enough to earn a job elsewhere. Once you can finish in the top 5 of the league, you get a password to load the international management game, in a manner similar to many of Dinamic's games.The standard features of football management games are included, such as player transfers, team selection and organising training. You have a team of scouts who can be sent out to investigate other clubs, giving ideas on potential signings and helping you plan for future matches. A full squad of young players who could potentially challenge for the first team are on offer as well. You can directly interact with your players, and also recieve newspaper reports assessing your team's performance. The matches are represented by fully-animated match footage, which is of a comparable visual standard to Krisalis' arcade football games.</plot>

			<plot>Graeme Souness Soccer Manager is a basic football managing game based on the English leagues where the player is responsible for bringing a team (any available) from the Conference to the top division.Options are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions. While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.</plot>

			<title_clean>The Great Giana Sisters</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The most popular story behind this game is that after the wild success of the Nintendo Entertainment System platformer Super Mario Bros., a small development team called Time Warp Productions offered to create a version of the game for the most popular home computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, but Nintendo was not interested in releasing Mario on anything other than the NES. Because they had already mostly finished creating the game to demonstrate their concept to Nintendo, Time Warp finished the project and replaced all the graphics with original ones, renaming the game The Great Giana Sisters. The game was released in 1987 for multiple platforms, and was very quickly withdrawn from shelves due to threats of legal action from Nintendo, due to the obvious similarities to their flagship title. These threats of legal action also lead the ZX Spectrum version of the game to be scrapped, despite nearing completion. Due to the short time the game was on shelves, legitimate copies of the game are extremely rare, and are prized by video game collectors.[CR]Sequel[CR]A successor named Giana 2 - Arthur and Martha was in development, however, it was never released, again due to legal actions from Nintendo (despite the fact that the game didn't have anything in common with Super Mario Bros. anymore). After changing the name of the game to Hard'n Heavy and a drastic graphical overhaul which included replacing all the sprites, it was finally released.[CR]Giana Reborn[CR]In 2005, the game was re-released for mobile phones. Nintendo licensed a heavily polished Nintendo DS remake/sequel of the game titled Giana Sisters DS, which was released in Europe on April 2009 and in Fall 2011 in North America. This version was also released on the iPhone and iPad in 2010.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Great Napoleonic Battles is a turn-based hex wargame which not only allows players to play three epic battles from the Napoleonic Wars but also includes a construction kit to re-create any land-based battle of the Napoleonic period. [CR]It consists of four programs: a 'Battle' program to play scenarios; a 'Mapmaker' to customise or create new maps; a 'Menmaker to create or modify units and pieces used in the battles; and a 'Warmaker' to modify rules, objectives and conditions of combat.[CR]The game comes with three ready-made scenarios - the battles of Marengo and Waterloo, where you play the French, and the battle of Quatre Bras where you play the British. Players can choose to play either side in a user-created scenario, or create two-player scenarios.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gremlins 2: The New Batch is a 1990 NES game that was developed and published by SunSoft. Based on the film of the same name, it puts the player in the role of Gizmo, a mogwai that must fend off an army of Gremlins and help his human friend Billy stop them from running amok.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Gremlins 2 is played from a top-down perspective. In most of the game's stages, the player, as Gizmo, must explore the area and reach the goal while defeating enemies, avoiding traps such as spiked floors, and jumping over gaps. The remaining stages consist solely of boss fights in which Gizmo must do battle with a gremlin. As the player progresses through the game, Gizmo will acquire more and more powerful weapons, starting with simple tomatoes and eventually upgrading to a bow, and ultimately explosive arrows.Most stages feature a shop that allows Gizmo to spend points on items and power-ups, including health restoration and balloons that allow him to temporarily recover if he falls into a pit.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Guardians is a puzzle game in which the player takes the role of a guardian who is tasked with containing the so-called "Triffids", balls of pure energy. The game is played in a top-down perspective and has two plains. The upper plane is where the player is active and has to build walls. There are blocks of five colours which can be freely moved over the area. If multiple blocks of the same colour come together, they fuse together and are no longer mobile; those fusions are called "cohesions".  Some blocks can be combined with any colour. The player can both use blocks which are already on the plain and place bricks from a reservoir. One to three triffids are on the lower plain and bounce up and down. If they bounce up and there is block hindering them, they are lost and give minus points. Regular blocks are destroyed when they come into contact; only cohesions are a permanent wall. The goal of each level is get a certain amount of points (by creating cohesions) within a time limit.</plot>

			<plot>Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets the player in charge initially of a small single-celled organism and challenges the player to guide its evolution. The initial tasks are to roam around finding food and then find a potential mate. Depending on the organism's status, different predators will be after it - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, the player is  taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and has the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually the organism can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish, or even human.</plot>

			<title_clean>Hack</title_clean>
			<plot>Hack is the precursor to NetHack, both members of the family of text-based Rogue-like games.  The gameplay of Rogue and its descendants is the quintessential computer role-playing game (RPG):  Choose a character class and venture forth into the dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure.[CR]Like all descendants of Rogue, Hack is displayed from a top-down view, painted with text characters.  The player ventures throughout the dungeon, visiting rooms connected by thin corridors.  Gameplay is turn-based, with the turn beginning with the player's action (move, attack, eat, cast spell, etc.).  Commands are mapped to various letters of the keyboard, including "i" for inventory, "e" for eat food, etc. with one exception:  Attacking a monster involves running into it, so the "attack" function shares the same keys as movement.[CR]Hack is one of the first significant deviations from Rogue, notable by the rich interaction possible in the game world:  Simple actions result in complex (yet logical) reactions.  For example, it is not uncommon to throw a boomerang only to miss the target and have it return to hit the player; or kill a monster that has the ability to turn you to stone as an attack, then accidentally step on its carcass on the way out and turn to stone; or having a bolt of fire from a magic wand ricochet around the room, hit the player, and cause his magic scrolls to catch on fire; etc.  In addition, monsters and objects have secondary, hidden properties; for example, killing and eating a leprechaun will result in the player randomly teleporting to different locations.[CR]Hack was originally written by Jay Fenlason, then heavily modified by Andries Brouwer.  Hack was ported to several different operating systems in 1986, then all the versions were merged into a single port by Mike Stephenson called NetHack, which deviated sufficiently significantly from any one version of Hack that it is considered a new game.</plot>

The game was released two years after the release of the film WarGames, when computer hacking and computer security were in the limelight. Despite this, Cartwright has stated that WarGames was no influence on the Hacker project.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The world mapThe player takes the part of the hacker, a person experienced in breaking into "secure" computer systems who accidentally acquires access to a non-public system. If they can hack in, they can gain control of nifty gadgets and access a secret global network. The game was shipped with hardly any instructions to get the game going, and no information on how to play, this gave the player the feeling that he/she did hack into a system. The player has to try to hack into the Magma, Ltd. computer system at the beginning of the game by guessing the logon password. Typing help or h in the command line would give a clue as to what the valid password is. Since first attempts at entry would be based on guess work access would eventually be granted to the player due a malfunction in the security system, allowing the player to enter. Once in the system, the player is then asked to identify various parts of a robot unit. Most parts of the unit have exotic and technical names, such as "asynchronous data compactor" or "phlamson joint" this again makes it more likely that the player will fail because he/she has to guess which part each name belongs to. Failure to identify each part correctly, without any errors cause the player to have to start again. only once the player has identified each part without failure can he/she move on.The Robot the player controls  The player gains control of the robot which can travel around the globe via secret tunnels, deep within the earth. The game's text says the robot is powered in some manner by magma. Before getting far, the player is informed that shredded portions of a secret document containing Magma, Ltd.'s plans for world domination have been stolen. The player is instructed to retrieve the document by bargaining with the spies who stole it, who are located at various locations throughout the globe. The player is warned it must be retrieved in order to prevent the US government from thwarting their plans. At this point, the player's objective is clear: retrieve the strips of the stolen document, but then deliver them to Washington DC. The rest of the game consists of hacking further into the Magma system and trying to evade being discovered by them while trying to stop them.The game doesn't feature a save option so if the played fails he/she must start all over again.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Hades Nebular is set in 2124: humanity needs to find new planets to settle on because energy reserves grow thin. So they send ten ships to different places in the universe to find something suitable. Unfortunately the emperor Hades gets his hands on the plans and wants to seize the colony ships. The computer of Colony 7 has a malfunction, however, meaning they arrive two years early. This gives them the time to prepare an attack on Hades Nebula, Hades' headquarter.The player takes a role of a small space ship to destroy Hades and his evil minions. The game is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player spends most of the time with dodging enemies, their bullets or asteroids. Of course he also has the weapon to shoot back. During the course of the game he can pick up extras which grant advantages like better speed or attack power.</plot>

			<plot>Hammer Boy is an average arcade game that plays like a cross between Kaboom! and Whack-a-mole.[CR]Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent the American Indians from reaching the tower behind your fort by hitting them on the head and putting out the fires that are thrown from the side. That's really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay.[CR]This game is based on the comic book hero.</plot>

			<plot>In a grim future, the people are kept under control by a horde of genetically-modified beings who look identical to everyone else, and appear to act the same, but are subtly controlling minds and actions. This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.[CR]You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.</plot>

			<title_clean>Hard Drivin'</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hard Drivin' is a first-person racing game developed by Domark, Binary Design and Tengen for the arcade. The game was primarily published by Atari and released in February 1989. Ports for the Genesis, Lynx, Super Nintendo and various PC systems were released in the following years.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The original arcade game features a full sit-down cabinet, complete with an early force feedback enabled steering wheel. Races include many A.I. opponents, which are spread around the track sparingly after the race start. Lap counts are typically two, consisting of many stunt obstacles such as loops and jumps, forcing the player to measure their speed at certain times to not overshoot a landing ramp, or lose momentum through a loop. If the player finishes in a top position, they are given an extra one-on-one race against the "Phantom Photon".[CR]Presentation[CR]The game was a substantial improvement in polygonal gaming, as most popular arcade racers of the time utilized animated 2-D sprites rather than a 3-D wire-frame environment. The player's vehicle strongly resembles a Ferrari Testarossa, which was a very popular sports car at the time of development.Traffic, A.I. opponents, and the fast-paced arcade music endemic to the late 1980's, are featured throughout Hard Drivin'.Hard Drivin' was the first arcade driving game to feature instant replay, which repeats the last several seconds of gameplay following a crash, in an elevated third-person perspective. The instant replay has its own specific musical accompaniment.   [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Harlequin is a side-scrolling platformer created by The Warp Factory and published in 1992 by Gremlin Graphics. You play Harlequin, who upon returning to his homeland of Chimerica finds that its heart has broken into four pieces. Harlequin must find them and mend the heart in the clock tower which lies at the center of the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of traveling across the landscape via running and jumping, while enemies are dispatched by spraying hearts at them. Many of the levels also feature puzzles which must be solved. The game is not linear in the typical platformer fashion; instead of running through a level from start to finish in order to proceed to the next, switches are scattered across the gameworld which open and close various paths between the game's levels. Careful exploration is required to figure out how to progress and where to go each time. Backtracking to previously visited levels is also sometimes vital.One of the game's more interesting features is a big level dedicated to parodying the Super Mario Bros. games, filled with objects that smile at the player and look eerily out of place when compared to some of the other levels.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game received rave reviews from enthusiast magazines at the time of release, but the lackluster sales prevented it from ever getting a sequel.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Harlequin's music was composed by Barry Leitch.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Harrier Strike Force is a jet simulation without plot. The game features one island with a gas fuel station, an airport and a tank headquarter with the simple goal to destroy everything. Of course there is resistance: there are five jets and ten tanks on the island. Those only get active after the previous is destroyed and rise in difficulty - destroying the associated building takes care about all at once. The player has access to three weapons: an unlimited 30mm cannon, three heat-seeking rockets (effective against jets) and 16 heat bombs for defense against enemy rockets. After everything is destroyed, the jet has to safely return to base.All this has to be completed before the jet fuel runs out, effectively giving the player only a few minutes to complete the goals. The main motivational factor is optimizing the high score because the effective measures (e.g. using the rockets or destroying the airport first) give much less points than the hard way. The player has various options for setting the game variables, e.g. difficulty or enemy behavior, but this prevents access to the high score list.</plot>

			<plot>A bi-directional horizontally scrolling platform game, Hawkeye has the player in control of an SLF (Synthetic Life Form) controlled from an underground bunker by the Xamoxians. On each level, the eyes of the hawks in the status panel flash to indicate the direction to travel in to find a puzzle piece. Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level.[CR]The player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo.[CR]The game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).</plot>

It was first released for the ZX Spectrum and had an unusual isometric view.The player controls two creatures, named Head (Headus Mouthion) and Heels (Footus Underium). Head jumps high but is slow so he is not able to get far. Heals is faster but doesn't jump very high. They move as two separate creatures, but can join and get the benefit of having both specialities.The game was made by Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond and is was their second game following a Batman game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is all about moving through rooms an corridors maximising the advantages of the two creatures. Some rooms and mazes can only be navigated with one of the two creatures and therefore forcing them to separate in two different directions to meet up later.Player get no help with navigation, so players must keep track of the map's layout themselves. More than 300 rooms have to be navigated to win the game.Creature AbilitiesHeadJumps twice as high as Heels.Have control while jumping.Can shoot doughnuts to stun enemies.HeelsCan climb certain staircases that Heels can not.Run twice as fast as Head.Can carry items.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The background story puts Head and Heels as two spies from the planet Freedom. They are sent to free other planets (Blacktooth, Penitentiary, Safary, Book World, and Egyptus) to free them from slavery. They had to defeat the Emperor to prevent further planets to fall into slavery. Head and Heels starts the game in a prison, separated and have to find each other to be able to escape from the prison.[CR]Remakes[CR]The game has been remade several times and the latest, available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and BeOS was made by Retrospec and is available as freeware on their website. This remake was voted as the second best remake ever by readers of PC Zone magazine. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Heat Wave: Offshore Superboat Racing is a racing game in which the player uses a power boat to race against four AI opponents. There are various aspects to keep track of during a race, like avoiding overheating the motors or a steady adjustment of the trim. During the race it may be needed to stop and conduct repairs on the ship due to contact with the opponents or the environment. However, it is important that the player took repair parts and fuel (which can be chosen after the qualifying race) with them. There are six courses and an editor to create more.</plot>

			<plot>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you'll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius. [CR]There are three kinds of combat simulations:[CR]1. MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies;[CR]2. FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;[CR]3. ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position.[CR]Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.</plot>

			<title_clean>Heimdall</title_clean>
			<plot>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. [CR]Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.[CR]The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.[CR]When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.[CR]The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).[CR]Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</plot>

			<plot>The alien race Hellraisers seized the planet Hazbal which is an important junction of space trade routes. The player's job is to drive them out of the system. The game consists of six levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. In the first, third and fifth level the player controls the mercenary himself who walks and jumps through the side-scrolling levels. With his weapon he shoots everything that moves and uses teleporters and holes to find his way. The other levels are horizontally shooters in a top-down perspective. The player controls a space ship, moves through the levels and shoots everything that moves. Killed enemies may leave symbols behind which give advantages when picked up.</plot>

			<title_clean>Hero Quest</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hero Quest, or HeroQuest, is a  turn-based fantasy role playing game, based on the popular board game of the same name. The game is played from an  isometric view. Up to four players choose from four characters: a dwarf,  a barbarian,  an elf, and  a wizard. Each of the characters have their own strengths and weaknesses. The elf and wizard, for example, are the only two classes that can use spells.While each scenario is built to be a self-contained dungeon that can be defeated by a brand new set of characters, there is an element of persistence. If a character survives their adventure, they can use the money they earned to purchase equipment which increases their odds of survival for the next quest. These include weapons and armor, which makes combat easier to survive, as well as useful items like trap-disposal toolkits that allows players to remove traps that they find. If a character falls during a mission, they need to be "renewed" before they can be selected again, and this process removes all equipment effectively undoing all progress. This is an aspect the game shares with its sister adaptation Space Crusade.This game and its board game inspiration were the chief reason that the Quest for Glory series of adventure/RPG hybrids had to be renamed from its original working title "Hero Quest". The "____ Quest" naming format had been a convention followed by most Sierra franchises at the time, such as King's Quest and Space Quest.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are fourteen levels, or "missions", and every character rolls to establish move order. Every round the player will have a dice roll which will decide how many move/action points they will get. These points are spent to move, fight monsters, and cast spells.The player characters can also find  potions and treasures around the map which can be traded at the shop after each level. To do this they must "search" the current room at either the start or the end of their turn, and this has an equal chance of spawning enemies and traps as well as producing treasure. Searching for secret doors instead will reveal hidden exits as well as traps.Combat uses a rudimentary dice system in which both combatants roll special dice to attack and defend, depending on who initiated the encounter. Each skull the attacker rolls is nullified by each shield the defender rolls. If there's more skulls than shields, the defender takes that many body points: most creatures in the game have only one. If there's a greater or equal number of shields, or the attacker fails to roll a single skull, then combat concludes with both participants unharmed. On the next action turn, the other participant can then initiate combat and switch roles.To beat a scenario, the player must locate the exit and leave. They ideally will have completed the objective posited by the mission overview, which can involve assassinating a specific monster, rescuing an NPC or collecting a certain item. By reaching the exit with the main mission completed, they earn a cash reward and the mission is listed as completed on their record. If they survived, the same character can then be used again for subsequent missions. The missions do not have to be completed in a specific order: rather, they're listed in a loose order based on difficulty.  [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hero Quest, or HeroQuest, is a  turn-based fantasy role playing game, based on the popular board game of the same name. The game is played from an  isometric view. Up to four players choose from four characters: a dwarf,  a barbarian,  an elf, and  a wizard. Each of the characters have their own strengths and weaknesses. The elf and wizard, for example, are the only two classes that can use spells.While each scenario is built to be a self-contained dungeon that can be defeated by a brand new set of characters, there is an element of persistence. If a character survives their adventure, they can use the money they earned to purchase equipment which increases their odds of survival for the next quest. These include weapons and armor, which makes combat easier to survive, as well as useful items like trap-disposal toolkits that allows players to remove traps that they find. If a character falls during a mission, they need to be "renewed" before they can be selected again, and this process removes all equipment effectively undoing all progress. This is an aspect the game shares with its sister adaptation Space Crusade.This game and its board game inspiration were the chief reason that the Quest for Glory series of adventure/RPG hybrids had to be renamed from its original working title "Hero Quest". The "____ Quest" naming format had been a convention followed by most Sierra franchises at the time, such as King's Quest and Space Quest.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are fourteen levels, or "missions", and every character rolls to establish move order. Every round the player will have a dice roll which will decide how many move/action points they will get. These points are spent to move, fight monsters, and cast spells.The player characters can also find  potions and treasures around the map which can be traded at the shop after each level. To do this they must "search" the current room at either the start or the end of their turn, and this has an equal chance of spawning enemies and traps as well as producing treasure. Searching for secret doors instead will reveal hidden exits as well as traps.Combat uses a rudimentary dice system in which both combatants roll special dice to attack and defend, depending on who initiated the encounter. Each skull the attacker rolls is nullified by each shield the defender rolls. If there's more skulls than shields, the defender takes that many body points: most creatures in the game have only one. If there's a greater or equal number of shields, or the attacker fails to roll a single skull, then combat concludes with both participants unharmed. On the next action turn, the other participant can then initiate combat and switch roles.To beat a scenario, the player must locate the exit and leave. They ideally will have completed the objective posited by the mission overview, which can involve assassinating a specific monster, rescuing an NPC or collecting a certain item. By reaching the exit with the main mission completed, they earn a cash reward and the mission is listed as completed on their record. If they survived, the same character can then be used again for subsequent missions. The missions do not have to be completed in a specific order: rather, they're listed in a loose order based on difficulty.  [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Heroes of the Lance</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Heroes of the Lance is an action-adventure game developed for various home computers and consoles by U.S. Gold and published by Strategic Simulations in 1988. Telling the stories of eight heroes as they traverse across the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, the game pits players against various enemies leading up to a confrontation with the ancient dragon Khisanth who holds the Disks of Mishakal, an ancient and powerful relic. It is the first in a series of three games developed by U.S. Gold under the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons name.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Differing drastically from Dungeons &amp; Dragons games from the past, Heroes of the Lance's central focus is on side-scrolling action as opposed to role-playing. Although the game would use relevant statistics, spells and rules from the official tabletop game, a difficult to use graphical interface and severe limitation on character use (forcing players to control one at a time, thus limiting creativity) meant that this arcade-like style of gameplay would be short lived for the series as fans rallied against the switch.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionPortraitGoldmoonA human cleric betrothed to Riverwind.

			<title_clean>High Steel</title_clean>
			<plot>High Steel is a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game. The player is a construction worker, one of the best at constructing skyscrapers out of pre-formed steel structures, who has now been called for a really tricky job. This building site has been infested with gremlins who make the job that much harder than it already is. The task at hand is simply to construct the buildings while not getting killed by the gremlins. To make it even trickier the contractor has set a time limit that has to be beaten. The building site is viewed from a side perspective and the player can move the construction worker left and right. From above building material is sent down with a crane. To build a new floor the player first has to pick up and position vertical girders and then consecutive floor segments that are placed on top of these. Once a girder is in place the player can climb it to move between the floors. A floor is considered complete when it consists of five floor segments supported by at least two girders. In the first level one floor has to be completed and the number increases with one for every new level. In addition to the building material the crane will also deliver food and drink. When picked up the player's score and energy level increases.Various creatures roam the construction site trying to make the job harder for the player. Most common are the gremlins that drop from above and move across the floors. They can eat objects and floor segments and will stun the player if they hit him in the head. Gremlins also drop eggs that mothers hatch out of. The mothers are lethal to touch but can be killed by throwing spanners at them. Mothers can give birth to crawlers that are as dangerous as their mothers. Another creature is the spitter which grows out of girders and spits acid globules at the player. Other dangers include falling bricks and banana skins that the player can skid on. </plot>

			<title_clean>Hillsfar</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hillsfar is part of SSI's collection of RPGs licensed with the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset from TSR Inc.. Thematically, it takes place between Pool of Radiance and the events of Curse of the Azure Bonds, although experience with either title is not required for this game. It is also generally not considered part of the SSI's Gold Box series due primarily to its divergent gameplay mechanics despite being set within the same campaign world (the Forgotten Realms).Gameplay was not party-based. It was primarily focused on the "lone adventurer" concept with the player controlling only one character throughout the experience. Various challenges such as missions and mini-games were issued to the player either by NPCs or simply through exploration.Quests and activities were focused on four of the main class-types: Thief, Cleric, Mage, and Fighter. The tactical combat used in the Gold Box series of party-based RPGs was not used in Hillsfar owing to that there were no random encounters. Instead, arcade sequences often replaced such challenges and fighting was handled within the Arena in similar fashion. Joystick support was provided for within Hillsfar as a result of this change.It was often regarded by players as something of a 'trainer' for characters that were moving from Pool of Radiance and into Curse of the Azure Bonds as they could be transferred from both titles. However, only characters from Curse could be transferred back into that game. Pool of Radiance characters imported into Hillsfar could not be transferred back.The game continued to use a codewheel as a form of copy protection.The manual was notable for the large amount of fiction that it contained to immerse the player within its interpretation of the Forgotten Realms. A full color map of Hillsfar and the surrounding region was provided along with the history behind it. A short story at the end of the manual set the stage for the adventure in Curse of the Azure Bonds.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Your party, exhausted and tired from their long journey, make camp outside of the city of Hillsfar. You alone decide to enter the Jewel of the Moonsea to see if you can make arrangements for supplies and perhaps learn of new challenges that may require your particular talents.How things have changed! Weapons are forbidden. Magic has been outlawed by the First Lord of the city. And training to improve your skills is all but forbidden within its walls. The Red Plumes, the First Lord's enforcers, ensure that the letter of his law is kept and anyone that resists can find themselves fighting in the Arena for their very lives.Hillsfar used to be a free city and one rife with intrigue, but the corrupt Council that had ruled it was suddenly overthrown in a coup led by Maalthir, formerly a merchant-mage and now self-appointed First Lord of the city. Under his control, the city became decidedly more militant and harsh rules were instituted that brought order but at a cost to freedom.The Red Plumes, once only a mercenary band, saw their numbers expand greatly with Maalthir's blessing and his funding. They soon grew into an army that enforced his rules. Ships were soon built within its port both to expand its trade as well as protect it from opportunists.There is also a racial bent to his policies that have seen the city swing from being a place that would welcome all newcomers to one where humanity is the favored guest. Hillsfar has become an ordered and tightly controlled city, but its citizens live under the repression of its tyrannical ruler and the enemies that it has made with its own ruthless expansion within the region.But it is also a place of opportunity for those that know where to look. The city is still filled with secrets and those willing to look the other way in order to get things done and a wise adventurer can earn a small living within its walls. That is where the player comes in. Overthrowing Maalthir may not be in the cards, but you can ensure that your stay is an exciting one.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Hillsfar deviates from the rest of the "Gold Box" series with its own engine which focuses on a mix of reflex-oriented exercises and quests to challenge the player with. It is no longer focused on the party and is strictly a single-character driven experience.Players can create their own character and save it to a save disk that must be created before the game can start to store them on.They can also be imported from Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds, although only those characters from Curse can be freely transferred back and forth from that game. As noted earlier, those imported from Pool cannot go back.There is no leveling within Hillsfar, although experience and gold are still earned. If the player's character dies, they must reload from the last save they had made at camp outside of the city. The camp is the only place where the player can save the game.The Arena is treated as the punishment area for characters that are caught breaking the law in Hillsfar by the Red Plumes. When the player is captured, they must fight for their freedom in the Arena. Depending on how severe the crime is, they may be sent to fight to the death instead.Because of the differences within its many mini-games, Hillsfar presents several different control schemes and interface tweaks in regards to each one. Joystick controls are shown within the manual (for the C-64 joystick) with corresponding key controls described in the text.Viewpoints of each environment vary greatly. For example, riding a horse brings up a side-scrolling view of the action as the player guides it. Within the city of Hillsfar, the player is presented with both an overhead map on the right side of the screen and a small, first-person window through which they can see the street. Arena fighting is viewed from a side view with the crowd as a backdrop. There is no tactical combat within the game as there is in the rest of the Gold Box series.RacesSix races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character. Sex has no bearing on the character's abilities aside from their appearance.As with most of SSI's 2ed AD&amp;D series, only six races were available:Dwarves: Excellent warriors and often considered the best blacksmiths within the Forgotten Realms, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Gnomes: These are treated as shorter and slimmer versions of dwarves in the game, although they tend to be a little better as thieves.Halflings: Resistant to magic and poison, they are about half the size of humans and can make decent fighters and thieves.Human: The most common race in the Forgotten Realms, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either.AttributesCharacters are also based on a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. However, in Hillsfar, mages cannot cast spells so this is a moot ability throughout the game.During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects.Many of the attributes are unchanged as they are from the Gold Box series, although they do not play as much of a factor in determining certain skills as they normally would. For example, although Dexterity is an important modifier for thieves, the lockpick mini-game largely negates this.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; in Hillsfar, this also affects how fast your arrow will travel at Tanna's Target Range or how much damage you can inflict in the ArenaDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects how often the sights move with your bow at Tanna's Target Range but does not play as major a role with thievery as it does in other RPGsConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a character; important for dealing with NPCsIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level. However, in Hillsfar, magic-use is prohibited.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use. As with mages, however, magic-use is prohibited.Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are allotted across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.AlignmentAD&amp;D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.The alignments available to the player are as follows:Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.ClassesGender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. Only non-human characters can take on more than one class.From the stock of basic classes, non-human characters can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather. They would normally have a backstab attack as a part of their skill set, but in Hillsfar's Arena, this is not available.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it. In Hillsfar, however, spell-use is prohibited.Magic Users - These are the spellcasters and are able to conjure the elements or deal damage with their magic. While fragile, they have the potential to be the most powerful members of any party as they become more experienced. Unfortunately in Hillsfar, they are not allowed to use magic other than with a wand when it comes to shooting things. Even in the Arena, they must use a staff to battle their opponent.Multi-classed characters enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.Quests are specifically aimed at certain classes and the game will randomly pick which quest it wants to assign to a multi-classed character.LocationsThe city of Hillsfar has a number of places to visit along with a few locations outside of its walls. Initially, the map of Hillsfar that you are given in the game is blank leaving you to fill in location names as you explore its streets.Guilds - Each class has one representing them in the city and are a convenient place to pick up hints or questsBank - Here, you can store your hard-earned goldPub - Gossip can be purchased with a drink to get you noticed.Archery Range - Practice and compete for the best scoreArena - Fight for glory or your freedomThe Shops - There are a number of these in the city allowing you to stock up on valuables such as healing potionsThe Temple of Tempus - Healing for a convenient donationThere is also a wilderness area outside of the city with a few locations that can be explored if you can get to them on horseback.[CR]Mini-Game Activities[CR]Hillsfar is unique among SSI's RPG offerings in terms of its mini-games. Each one offers a different challenge to the player and is largely dependent on their own puzzle solving abilities and reflexes as opposed to their character's.The ArenaIn Hillsfar, the Arena is where fighters can test their will to win against a series of opponents or where criminals struggle for their lives in order to pay for their crimes. Money, honor, and fame are all prizes to be won here, although the taste of freedom is far more often the most cherished of any of these by the participants. It is also the only place in the game where combat takes place. There are no random encounters in the game.In the Arena, the player is presented with a slightly isometric placement of their character and their opponent with the Arena serving as the backdrop. Keyboard (and joystick) controls allow the player to execute moves such as attacking to the left or right, or blocking in the same way. A special attack can also be used.Contestants are only allowed to use a staff in combat regardless of class. Bars representing health for both the player's character and that of their opponent are displayed at the top of the screen. The opponent is also displayed on the left hand side with their name and picture.Opponents tend to follow specific patterns and it is up to the player to determine when they should strike by predicting what they are going to do next.Riding a HorseFrom the camp, the player can ride a horse either to Hillsfar or to specific points outside of the city as selected on a regional map. Many times, there is only one path to their destination, but occasionally, a question mark can pop up indicating a different path that can be taken.The horse riding sequence is shown from a side scrolling perspective. A joystick can be used as well as a keyboard allowing the player to speed up, slow down, duck beneath branches, or jump over obstacles.If a Rod of Blasting is found, the player can use it to destroy the obstacles in their path although these have a limited set of charges.Crashing a horse goes against how often it can take such abuse before running away. Different horses also have different temperaments, often challenging the player in different ways as they try to keep them under control. One horse may like speeding up on its own, while another may like to jump at unpredictable times.Tanna's Target RangePlayers can practice or play for gold at the target range within the city. Practice sessions are free, although playing to defeat the scores listed on the board will cost some coin. Players are required to rent a weapon when they opt to either practice or to compete. Each weapon is focused on particular class.Clerics can only use a slingMages can only use a wandArrows are fast and available to fighters and thievesDaggers are the heaviestDarts are lighter than daggersOnce the weapon is selected, the player will be presented a number of targets. How valuable they are will also determine the difficulty of hitting them. Dexerity plays a key role in helping to control the drift of your crosshairs onscreen. The windmill also gives you a hint on how strong the wind is and the lighter the weapon, the more it will be affected by this.Players only have ten shots when they start and with the last one, the results are tallied and then they are awarded any prizes that they have won.You cannot shoot Tanna.Lock PickingThief-classes will find more locked chests in this game than any other and when they run across one, or a lock of any other kind, they can try to pick it. If you don't have any lock-picks or aren't a thief or have an NPC with you that can pick a lock, you have these options instead:Leave! Do Not Try This Lock: Simply leave the lock the way you found itUse Physical Strength to Force It: Strong characters can try and force it open, but if it's trapped, it will likely set it offPick The Lock With A Small Object: Anything goes, but if it's trapped, it might set it off.Use A Knock Ring: Knock Rings are magical and can automatically open locks but are consumed in the casting.Use The Chime Of Opening: Like the ring, it opens locks, but it is hidden somewhere in the game.Thieves with the right tools, on the other hand, get an entirely different set of options. A screen comes up displaying the lock, the tumblers, and a series of picks.Each tumbler must be picked in turn and each one requires a different pick that matches it. The player can flip picks to match the tumbler pattern and try to pick it before moving to the next one. Jammed tumblers can often require more than one try to loosen them and picks can also be broken in the attempt if it is forced. If you try to pick a tumber with the wrong pick, it may also break.Traps can also be set off when you fail to pick it. The sequence is also timed and running out of time returns the player to the previous screen before the attempt, likely setting off whatever trap the lock had on it.ExploringThe player will also have the opportunity to explore buildings well past their closing times and other locations such as sewers and mazes. Many of these places hold riches and relics, but only if the player can enter and escape without notice. The Red Plumes are also on patrol throughout Hillsfar and getting caught may send the player to the Arena if it happens often enough.Exploring these locations drops the game into a top down view of the area and the player must move them from screen to screen. Chests and locked doors are only two of the obstacles in these areas. The player is also timed on their stay and must work quickly to explore and recover as much treasure as they can. Since there is no combat in the game outside of the Arena, touching a guardian or a guard reduces how much time you have left to explore.When the player runs out of time and they are touched by an enemy, they are captured and all of their items confiscated. They may even be sent to the Arena depending on the severity of their trespass.

			<plot>(From The Infocom Homepage Entry)[CR]As a child, you spent most of your summers with your Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy. What memories! Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, Aunt Hildegarde his loving (and very rich) wife. They had no children of their own, but you and your cousins loved their house, their parties, the Hollywood memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and Hildy were a bit eccentric -- but that added to their charm. [CR]Aunt Hildegarde kept the house when Uncle Buddy passed away. And now that she's suddenly died, you remember her unusual will. You will inherit the entire estate -- probably worth millions if you can spend just one night in the house and on the grounds, find a treasure or two. But if you can't then you inherit nothing. [CR]And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being dropped off in front of a dark house, not to far from Hollywood ...</plot>

			<plot>Hollywood Poker Pro is a strip poker game and the successor of Hollywood Poker. The poker variant of choice is Draw Poker. The gameplay is similar to most other games of this kind: the player chooses one of four girls and plays poker against her. If he runs out of money, the game is lost - if she runs out of money, she loses a part of her clothes. If she is successful, she can buy back a part of her wardrobe. The AI adapts to the player's style, but this is only true within the same match.The goal is to strip the girl naked. The Amiga and C64 version allow to zoom into the photographs.</plot>

			<plot>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.</plot>

			<plot>Nr. 1 Super Guy is a straightforward platform action game where you play as Hong Kong Phooey himself to help fight crime. In this game Baron Von Bankjob has escaped from jail and it is up to Hong Kong Phooey to find him. The game starts off with the trademark scene of Hong Kong Phooey jumping out of his file cabinet as seen on the animated TV show. From there on you must maneuver yourself through each of the levels full of obstacles like the Baron's thugs, collapsing platforms, conveyor belts, oil and acid patches. Hong Kong Phooey's health is displayed via the "Hong Kong Phooey Book of Kung Fu" meter located on the bottom left of the screen. Collect drinks to help replenish your health, unlock doors and activate switches to help advance further into the level to find Baron Von Bankjob and bring him to justice.</plot>

			<plot>Peter Banning is an ordinary suburban dad with two kids - or so everyone thinks. What not even his family know is his past as Peter Pan, scourge of Captain Hook in JM Barrie's children's fiction. Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back.[CR]It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.</plot>

The levels are bigger as one screen, scrolling in all directions, with a horizontally split-screen in two-player mode.The roads contain narrow curves, and some tracks include alternatives, which the player can choose which one to take. There is no career mode, each track has to be selected individually, and the goal is to win this individual level.The are many options, you can disable the collisions, the AI controlled cars, the oil or the amount of   rounds required to finish a level.An editor is included, allowing to design your own tracks, including checkpoints and obstacles. The created levels can be loaded and saved to disk.</plot>

			<plot>A text adventure game set in HP Lovecraft themes in 1920's. [CR]The game's character generation routine was unusual. It was an ambitious project that was meant to carry over to a game series called "Timeline" which never happened. You had to guide the character's career through WWI, professions, as he or she gets skill points to distribute. Not many games had skills at all, let alone the plethora of skills to choose from in this game.[CR]The text part of the game is a supernatural thriller where you have to escape the curse of the Hound of Shadow in 1920's London. It opens with a friend taking you to a seance to debunk. Strange things happen and you discover that you are under a curse. You research history and lore in musty bookstores, and the London Library to gather information about the Hound. As you play, you are likely to learn about mythology, and the occult, too. [CR]There is a time limit, though, the Hound will get you eventually if you don't get on the ball.</plot>

			<title_clean>Hunter</title_clean>
			<plot>Don't kill the rabbitsHunter is a 3D action-adventure game programmed for the Amiga and Atari ST by Paul Holmes, and was published by Activision for in 1991.The main quest for the player character, The Hunter, is to find a general and bring his head back to the employer.This is done by running, driving, swimming, sailing and shooting your way from point to point around the huge world getting new co-ordinates from people you meet until you finally get to the general and can retrieve his head.Giving the player a large degree of freedom, it could be called an early sandbox game. The game has a lot of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. Some of the vehicles are, boats, tanks, jeeps, bicycles, helicopters, surfboards and hovercrafts.Control of the character are relatively simple, out of necessity; the Atari and Amiga had 1-button joysticks. However, mouse and keyboard controls are also used to select weapons, adjust zoom levels, etc.Apart from the island empires military forces there is wildlife that concists of rabbits, seagulls and dangerous sharks. Killing wildlife results in a message that you have "Destroyed a seagull for -30 credits". A group called "destroy all seagulls" currently exists on Facebook.The intro screen/opening of the game has music by Martin Walker, but in the game itself, there are only ambient sounds. These consist mostly of waves, seagulls, and engine noise from whatever vehicle the player might be in.Graphically, the game was technically impressive for the time and the machines it was programmed for. The polygonal 3D graphics were somewhat limited in colo, animation and framerate, but the game generally performed well.It was critically well received, with scores in the high 80 to mid 90-range.[CR]</plot>

A spin on the usual zero-gracity racer, in this game you control a hovercraft with the goal of protecting a valuable item from clipping into the hands of theives. While dodging enemy fire, you can pass through tunnels and collect fuel capsules. At the end of each level you can visit a shop to upgrade your hydroplane.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released for the Atari Lynx, Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 7,7,6,7, adding, "...a standard race and chase game that does not offer too much in the wat of innovation. It is kind of fun and the challenge is there, but it did not keep my interest for very long".[CR]</plot>

Signalling for your team-mates to pass you the ball is a key gameplay element - don't expect to just watch your team win with no contribution from you. When you gain possession (or press the button while not in possession) your player automatically turns to face the goal.[CR]Only single matches are on offer. There are ten skill levels; match lengths and team kits can also be modified. Two-player matches are split-screen. Unlike Sensible Soccer and Kick Off 2, the offside rule is featured.</plot>

			<title_clean>The Immortal</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Inventory Screen (Amiga)The game follows an apprentice who discovers a message in a puff of smoke from an enchanted candle from the Wizard Mordamir who is trapped in the dungeon far below and counting on Dunric to save him. Continuing further in the dungeon, the apprentice encounters goblins, trolls, and all manner of traps and monsters. While sleeping on straw, he dreams of an ancient city a thousand years old with water and young people everywhere. On his way through the dungeon he frees Ana, Dunric's daughter. Then the apprentice learns that the ancient city was a place where waters from the Fountain of Youth would flow from goblins who ask for his help in distracting The Norlac, a sort of water monster, in the canals below. Through another dream, he learns of an ancient peaceful civilization of dragons guarding the Fountain of Youth. Using his wits, the apprentice tricks the monster into falling into a whirlpool, but then he also is sucked in. Barely surviving the event, the wizard presses forth and has another dream. This time it's about the ancient city's council members and wizards gathering together and planning a siege, and then flashes of battles between wizards and dragons. By now he is nearing the bottom of the dungeon, and at the bottom he discovers one dragon survived the war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Magic Carpet ride (DOS)The Immortal has a lot of item-based puzzle solving, lots of deadly enemy encounters, tons of traps, and requires patience to survive. At times the game is unforgiving, wherein if you use items before they're required or in the wrong place the game will make it impossible to proceed. Sometimes the traps will be inanely difficult to proceed through, such as the infamous "Worm Room". Thankfully each level is short, so if you survive through it all you can record the "certificate" (what The Immortal calls its passwords) and continue playing another time. Combat in this game is either about entirely avoiding enemies, or going to a combat screen where the idea is to dodge until you build up your stamina and then start slashing the enemies to bits with your sword. There are several spell scrolls to pick up, and at one point even a magic spellbook that allows you to cast a minor fireball spell infinitely. The game also has certain points where you can float around to avoid the giant worms and tiny spiders such as the magic carpet and the levitation spell. This mechanic feels the same each time, as it's almost like controlling a car that can constantly accelerate, but the controls are quite horrendous and it's hard to survive these segments, as well as the one later in the game with the creature in the water canals while riding a barrel.The game has a few alternate endings with minor detail differences, based upon actions earlier in the game.DeathDueling the giant Spider Queen (DOS)In "The Immortal", there are so many ways to die, and many ways to kill. When fighting goblins and trolls, the apprentice can decapitate them, slice them in half at the waist, and from the head to the groin, make their heads explode, cause them to turn to ashes, and skin them alive. The apprentice himself can be consumed by slimes, body slammed and eaten by giant worms that burst through the ground, fall through trap doors, get stepped on during a shrink spell, use an amulet that causes him to die instantly, fed upon by a giant Queen Spider, and can be eaten alive by hundreds of tiny spiders.[CR]Alternate Versions[CR]Level 6The sixth level of the game only appears in certain versions of the title. It features the giant spider Queen and the tiny spider sacks that when touched will overwhelm the apprentice with dozens of spiders that eat him alive. The level also features a brief portion where the wizard can acquire some alcohol, and either drink it or use it to solve a puzzle. Drinking the alcohol would actually intoxicate the player, and make every direction the apprentice would walk in completely random.Amount of GoreThe PC and Genesis/Mega Drive versions of this game had a markedly different level of gore during finishing moves in battle. Most of the gory deaths were absent from the PC version, while the Genesis/Mega Drive version had bloody eviscerations which were all kinds of awesome.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Imperium is a strategy simulation game in which the player is the Emperor of a region of space. The player can micromanage every part of their empire, from building spaceship fleets to establishing alliances and ensuring loyalty from their vassals. The game is entirely menu-driven, with each icon representing a different action the Emperor can perform that turn.Imperium was released on the PC, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga in 1990. The game should not be mistaken for the 1992 SNES shoot 'em up from Vic Tokai with the same name.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. [CR]As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.[CR]The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</plot>

			<title_clean>In 80 Days around the World</title_clean>
			<plot>Based on a tale first scripted by Jules Verne. You start as Phileas Fogg in the Reform Club of London where Fogg boasts that he is able to traverse the world in 80 days. The nobs of the Reform Club force him to bet all he owns: 20.000 GBP. Together with your Butler Passepartout you set off on 2nd October to your great adventure. [CR]Half the time of the game you play as Phileas Fogg, half the time as Butler Passepartout. The screen shows a world map, a puffing train in the corner indicates the speed level you travel, a money bag indicates your finances and 2 buttons exist where you can bribe (to speed up the train) and play cards (to increase your financials). Action parts are arcade-styled, normally side-scrolling platform-action in which you have to collect items for your further travel. The first action-adventure parts starts in India, where you  control Passepartout running through the Jungle to a temple where you have to collect something for your further adventures. While running through the jungle, Indians drop things on you and throw  spears after you. You must beware of fall traps and make the exit in time or your adventure is over.[CR]Your next stop take place in Japan - here you have to catch acrobats on your shoulders. Next action part in America: Beware of dodging wolves! Afterwards you must copy the dance of an indian medicine-man if you don't want to end as an Indian snack... Finally after returning to England you have to master the Dungeons of London. Are you able to return within 80 days to the Reform Club?</plot>

			<plot>The Incredible Shrinking Sphere of the title comes under your control in this isometric maze game which has similarities to Marble Madness and Spindizzy. The ball needs to be guided from the start of a level to the end, through 4 linked sections.[CR]Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.</plot>

			<plot>Being an action title, the game starts off where Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and determined the location of ancient discs needed to open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.</plot>

			<plot>Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin &amp; Win' Indianapolis 500 in 1985, put his name to this Super Sprint style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.</plot>

			<plot>Insects in Space is a side-scrolling shooter with similarities to Defender. Insects killed everyone on Earth except a few babies. This causes the mystical leader of motherhood, St. Helen, to travel to Earth's remains and save the babies. The most important feature of this protagonist is the fact that she is topless and - as prominently mentioned in the manual - "big breasted", but she controls and shoots just like the space ship normally found in those games. The levels are side-scrolling and St. Helen can move in both directions. Additionally the levels are two screens high, the lower with a floor and the higher with a ceiling, which can be changed by leaving the current screen to the top respectively bottom. The babies are either positioned at the top or bottom level and are hunted by bees. Those bees pick them up, steal their life energy to create a new monster and drop them to the ground to die. The player's job is to kill the bees and save the babies. To help, a radar shows where in the level a kidnapping is in progress. Babies can be either returned to the ground for points or kept in Helen's grasp to convert them into power-ups eventually. Helen can also summon a dust cloud which teleports her near a bee target.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Created by British developer Archer Maclean, International Karate + built on the formula established by International Karate, its prequel. The numerous improvements included the adding of a third fighter on screen. Only two of these three could be controlled and each fighter only differed in the colour of their gi. The game was fought over rounds, presented in a 2D fighting arena with a Japanese feel.Characters are controlled with a keyboard or joystick, through a combination of direction and a single button press in a manner similar to modern day equivalents. The original soundtrack was composed by Rob Hubbard.Whilst a fondly remembered fighting game per se, it is perhaps best known for the British humour laced through-out. Examples included in the Amiga and Atari ST versions were pressing "T" to make all the trousers of the fighters fall down. The typing of other key words would cause a sunset or a bird to fly by. Typing a swear word of common parlance would illicit an on screen warning to desist, persisting to type curse words would cause the game to reset to its title screen.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Dreams are made by The Dreamtrack Corporation, a group of evil subliminal-messengers whose intention is to destroy the minds of the minority of people capable of interpreting other people's dreams and live them out through entertainment. That's the story in this distinctly Cyberpunk-inspired title, and you play Chad, the man who discovers this secret, and aims to put an end to it.[CR]Your task on each level is to clear a path for Kaf-E, your girlfriend, to be able to progress to the heart of the Dreamtrack HQ, getting past each of the myriad of security systems they have built up. A map must be used to navigate the route through the systems, with lots of information readily available.[CR]The basic gameplay sees you darting through 3D tunnels using the mouse, and is like a prototype Descent, with your ship kitted out with cannons and missiles, with each enemy better dealt with by one or the other.[CR]As well as ensuring your own survival, you must guide Kaf-E through the levels by blasting out the correct sections to clear a path for her. As she has no intelligence, and simply walks into walls, this element can be compared to Lemmings.</plot>

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races.

			<plot>Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom is the sequel to Ishar: Legend of the Fortress.[CR]Following the defeat of Krogh and the banishment of the powers of chaos, Ishar became a cultural and intellectual centre in Kendoria. Over time people came to the island and settled there and a city, named "Zach's Island" developed. Shandar, a monk of chaos, entered the city along with settlers from the northern lands. His trading in hallucinogens soon made him rich and powerful. Eventually Shandar controlled "Zach's Island" and had many followers and worshippers. He built a strong fortress, a second Ishar, to challenge the empire.[CR]In the sequel you can import saved characters from Ishar, or create your own team.[CR]In the game you have to explore the magic land (dungeons, tree-cities, mountain paths with real graded height effect), fight the enemies, join the allies and relax in towns, which even have medieval nightclubs. [CR]Now the area is 3 times bigger, and innovation is your ability  to use pet animals as allies in battles, and create magic potions. There are day and night cycles.</plot>

			<plot>Squash simulations are something of a rarity, and it was this nich&#233; that Krisalis aimed one of their many sports simulations into. The rules of squash are accurately recreated, with a realistic court layout (viewed isometrically) and a need to hit legal shots. Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.</plot>

			<plot>"James Pond" is (obviously) a parody on the famous agent 007 stories. You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename RoboCod is the second game in the James Pond series, which is also known as Super James Pond. It features the piscine special agent in a new mission at the North Pole. Unlike its free-form predecessor, James Pond 2 is a far more traditional side-scrolling platformer.The game was originally released on the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sega Genesis in 1991. They were followed with ports to the Amiga CD32, C64, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System and the Super Nintendo. It has recently received additional graphically enhanced ports for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Network.There have been multiple publishers for the game. The SNES port alone has three: Victor Interactive Software published the game in Japan, American Softworks in the US and Ocean Software in Europe. EA, US Gold and others have published the game on other systems.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename Robocod is a side-scrolling platformer which is very similar in feel and gameplay to the early Super Mario Bros. games. The player takes on the role of James Pond; a walking fish with body armor who must free all of the Penguins and Toys that the evil Dr. Maybe has captured. In addition to the more traditional elements of platforming, the player has the ability to extend James' body vertically in order to reach platforms and items. He also has access to a number of vehicles throughout the game, such as cars, biplanes and a flying bath.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The UK version of the game contains one of the earliest known forms of in-game product placements with the Penguins in the game advertising the "Penguin" chocolate bar by McVities.The SNES version of the game was called Super James Pond in North America, whereas in other regions it was called Super James Pond 2.The Playstation, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game are re-makes rather than ports, with changes to music, level design and art, they are generally considered to be inferior games.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand revealed little in his short review of the SNES version of the game other than his review score of 5 out of ten. He wrote, "...James's ability to make himself tall is quite interesting, but that is really the only special thing about him". He suggested that fans of the franchise may prefer Aquatic Games.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>As Amity Island's Police Chief Brodie, it is your responsibility to stop the lethal shark Jaws from killing the residents and tourists. The Mayor is keeping an eye on you, and wants the job done as quickly and cheaply as possible.Unfortunately, the main weapon which must be used to finally kill Jaws has been broken into four pieces, which are located along the sea bed in different places. As you explore the 150-plus screens of the game, you must shoot the other fish - some can be shot using your standard weapon, while others (those which flash) must be shot using special limited bullets.You also have responsibility for closing beaches, which removes the risk of a shark attack, but also costs the area business, especially on hot days, and irritates the Mayor.</plot>

			<plot>Based on subLOGIC's classic Flight Simulator.  Choose either an F-16 Fighting Falcon for land missions or an F-18 Hornet for missions starting at sea from an aircraft carrier.  You can practice flying and aerobatics in "free flight" mode, dogfight against Soviet MiGs, launch strikes against land or sea based targets, watch a demo, or load a subLOGIC scenery disk.  For either combat mode, you get to select which missiles and bombs your plane will have.[CR]Most of the indicators a real jet fighter would have are present:  altimeter, heading, frame loading, gear status, brake status, fuel level, radar, attitude, and range.  You can turn a few of these on and off.  Controls consist of either the joystick or numeric keypad for steering and other keys to handle your optional indicators, landing gear, weapons, and even the eject button!  Lastly, if you want a different perspective, you can get a view from the control tower instead of your cockpit.</plot>

			<plot>The Chapel Willies bedroomJet Set Willy is a flick screen platform game written for the ZX Spectrum. The sequel to the seminal Spectrum platformer, Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy concerns the quest of the protagonist, Miner Willy, to clean up his mansion after a (presumably large considering the size of his abode) party by collecting various items that have been strewn across its many rooms. Having finished collecting all of these items, Miner Willy looks forward to a well deserved rest. His task is not made easier by the marauding creatures that fill each and every room of his mansion and the many inch perfect leaps and manoeuvres he is required to perform in order to collect the items from the awkward locations his guests have left them.The game was written by the periodically reclusive programmer Matthew Smith and received near universal praise on release. It remains a classic title in any retrogame library to this day.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>First assemble your rocket by collecting the three rocket pieces with your jetpack, then fill it with fuel by collecting fuel drums with your jetpack and finally blast off with your rocket to the next level. After the first level the rocket is already in working condition so all the player has to do is to fill it up with fuel. While picking up pieces of the rocket and fuel drums the player has to defend him-/her-self against an onslaught of countless aliens coming from the left and right. Now and then bonus items will drop down from above and they will give the player extra ammo, extra point and such things. The game features 50 one-screen levels and was coded in 68000 assembler.</plot>

			<plot>The famous animated TV series by Hanna-Barbera spawned a film, and ultimately this licensed game, which contains 8 levels alternating between side-scrolling dodge-and-manipulate and driving gameplay. All four members of the Jetson family have a themed level.The driving sections take place within George's Jetcar, and you must slow down for the speed-limited areas and beware of black holes.At the beginning of the game you are George Jetson, labourer of the Spacely Space Sprockets company in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you to work, but you want to collect money and have a fun. So after the boss ordinary order you can explore the company as usually, collect money bills and useful items, avoiding dangerous robotic mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself. On further levels, other Jetsons family members must do the same things, but at their own locations. Level 2 involves taking Jane out of her booby-trapped home, level 3 sees Judy trying to get a kiss form pop heartthrob Jet Screamer, and finally Elroy is locked in at school and has to escape.You have to activate the items hidden behind the hatches with buttons. These allow you to progress on level, for example, fix an elevator with wrench. Time presses and you have to complete your mission quickly.</plot>

			<title_clean>Jim Power - Mutant Planet</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A action Platform game where you take on the role of Jim Power. Completely joystick driven. The action consists of walking across a horizontally-scrolling backdrop, and shooting of the enemy as they appear. Point, Time and Life bonuses can be found along the way, and Jim's considerable armaments (mostly guns) can be enhanced, too. These bonuses are held in small pods which float in the air. When shot, they drop both bonus points and a useful add-on, which include extra lives, smart bombs or a shield &#8211; however, the latter is relatively useless and lasts mere seconds before evaporating.There are five levels to be explored, each of which is nearly fifty screens long, and involve leaping across moving platforms and ramps and overcoming other similar obstacles. Simple as this sounds, though, the sheer number of enemy sprites thrown at you make it a frustrating and thankless task. The jump 'n' shoot action is nicely paced and unrelenting, with lots of stuff to kill, collect and negotiate. Jimbo himself is very controllable and the only bugbear is that he doesn't fire when he's running.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is a snooker simulation game and was one of the first games to be created by Archer Maclean.At the time of its release it was heralded as being as close as you could get to real life snooker without actually being at a real table and could be used as a training aid. This was mostly due to the fact that the game made full use of 16-bit home computers graphics and processing abilities and, for its time, had very realistic ball physics.Even today this game is considered by many to be THE snooker game which all others are compared to.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is standard snooker rules for one or two players. There is also a trick shot mode included with pre-set up tables with instructions on how to complete each shot.There are 4 computer players to play against. Tom, Dick, Harry and Jimmy. Jimmy being the hardest of the 4 computer opponents, named after the games namesake professional snooker player Jimmy White. Beating Jimmy was the ultimate test of your skill as the computer AI for Jimmy had a habit of clearing the table with a maximum break of 147 points, if given the chance.Balls make faces at you if you take too long over a shot.Thanks to a well laid out user interface, playing snooker in Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is surprisingly easy to get to grips with but difficult to master, much like real snooker. Using the menu to the left of the screen you can set your spin / English on the cue ball as well as your power, raise and lower the butt of the cue etc. You also have the option to apply chalk to the tip of the cue, something you have to do after every shot, specially when applying side / English to the cue ball, to avoid having a miss cue and messing up the shot.[CR]Humor[CR]Even though the game is thought of and designed as a serious snooker simulator there is a humorous side to it. If you left the mouse alone for a while flies would begin to buzz around the screen and if you took too long playing a shot the balls on the table will pull funny faces at you occasionally holding up signs saying things like "Get on with it".[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you.[CR]And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. [CR]Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.[CR]Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</plot>

			<plot>In the 14th century, England has a presence in France, and as Charles, it's up to you to get rid of them. You are heir to the throne, and will have power if you can recapture the city of Rheims from the English, with Joan's help as everybody else thinks it's a lost cause.Combat is one major aspect of this arcade-strategy hybrid. Armies are made up of archers, cavalry and foot soldiers, whose movement and firing angle must be controlled. Storming a city also involves defeating some staunch defences.Once you have overall control, your goal is to reunite France, by retaking each city in turn. You must raise taxes so as to have the adequate funds (but don't let provinces become unhappy, they can rebel), and use this money to fund a big army. Sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword though - many devious diplomatic tactics are available, including bribery and poison.</plot>

			<plot>Released to coincide with the 1992 European Football Championships, and licensed around Jamaican-born Liverpool star John Barnes.[CR]The gameplay is superficially similar to Krisalis' previous Manchester United Europe title. The action is viewed from side-on and overhead, giving a slight forced perspective. [CR]Unlike Manchester United Europe, only a small amount of the pitch is visible at a time, which makes the game faster, but amkes long-range passing harder (perhaps to make the game more like Barnes' own style)[CR]Control is precise and the ball sticks to your feet to some extent. The only teams included are the 8 qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships, and that is the only tournament. You can play either as the nearest player to the ball, ro always be Barnes.</plot>

The main character is a knight, but unlike medieval knights he rides a yellow flying ostrich. The object is to get to the next level , called a wave, without being defeated by enemy knights, who ride mounted upon flying vultures.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jousting is hard work.The object of Joust is to defeat all of the other jousters on the stage. This can be done by making contact with them while the player's jouster's jousting spear is higher than the enemy's is. As long as this is the case when the player's jouster collides with an enemy, they will be defeated. To ensure that an enemy jouster will not return, however, it is necessary to pick up the egg that is dropped when they are defeated. If the egg isn't collected quickly, it will hatch into another jouster and another buzzard will quickly arrive to pick him up and return him to the fight.There are lava pits on either side of the island on the lowest level of the battleground. In the early stages these pits will be sealed so that falling into them is impossible, but eventually they will open up and become a hazard to both the player and the enemies. Living in the lava is a lava troll who will grab any character that flies too close to it, players and enemies, and attempt to drag them down into the lava. It is possible to escape the troll when caught by flying hard enough.An enemy pterodactyl appears if too much time elapses in a stage. The beast appears to be unbeatable, but it can actually be killed by stabbing it directly in its mouth when it is open. This is difficult however because the creature moves much faster than other enemies. It will also leave if all the other jousters on the stage are defeated.[CR]Ports[CR]Joust has appeared on nearly every popular gaming system to date in some form or another. Usually it is packaged into a "best of" package but more recently it has been sold stand-alone on popular download services such as Xbox Live Marketplace and on the PlayStation Network.Joust was ported and released on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace.

			<title_clean>Judge Dredd</title_clean>
			<plot>Just another day for Judge Dredd in Mega City One as he fights crime and tries to return the city back to some normality. You play the Judge as he tries to attempt six missions of crime. Once a mission is completed there is a bonus level related to the last mission to attempt. Take too long to complete a mission and the crime rate rises. Let the rate get too high and it's game over.To aid the Judge you have various weapons to fire and also your Lawmaster bike. This allows you to move around faster but you can't fire your weapon or arrest people thus making the crime rate rise. Judge Dredd is a side view platform game that scrolls as you move left or right. Pressing the space bar allows you to change from walking to riding your bike. The joystick controls your character while the fire button shoots your weapon. </plot>

			<plot>Jupiter and its moons are colonized, and are an ideal setting for motor racing. 3 lap races featuring 3 cars each take place, viewed from above. Weapons which can throw a car off course are commonplace, as are short cuts and speed-boosting pads (which do not always follow a conventional racing line). As well as the races, there are timed money-collecting bonus duels on enclosed circuits.You are one of the competitors, either in single races or a full season. Money is won for results, and collected as it lies on track. This can be spent on improvements such as engine and armor upgrades, as well as more powerful races.</plot>

			<title_clean>The Karate Kid - Part II</title_clean>
			<plot>The Karate Kid: Part II - The Computer Game is a one-on-one fighting game based on the movie The Karate Kid: Part II. The storyline of the movie is not directly addressed; the player only participates in five fights based on movie scenes. The difficulty rises from fight to fight.The player uses the input device to perform a multitude of moves, kicks and strokes. When changing direction (e.g. after jumping over the opponent) the controls reverse. Every successful hit drains the opponent's energy and improves the high score - the opponent tries to do the same to the player, of course. Between fights there are two mini games with digitized movie images: either catching flies with chopsticks (basically a reaction game) or breaking an ice block with bare hands (building up enough force by joystick wiggling).The two-player mode is basically the same, only that the second player takes the role of Daniel's opponent. The last fight is not played and the mini games between fights are played by both players in turns.</plot>

			<plot>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</plot>

			<title_clean>Kick Off 2</title_clean>
			<plot>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).[CR]Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</plot>

			<plot>Return to Europe is a data disk for Kick Off 2 that allows the player to participate in three major European Competitions: the UEFA Cup, the Cup Winners Cup and the European Cup. This was topical in the UK, as English clubs had just been readmitted into Europe, having been banned for several years following the Heysel stadium disaster of 1985.[CR]The competitions are at different skill levels. The European Cup is the toughest of the three competitions. Each competition contains 32 teams that can be edited. The player can also load teams from the Giants of Europe data disk as well as from Player Manager. Tactics can be loaded from the Winning Tactics data disk.</plot>

			<plot>Although not released for 8-bit systems, this platform game has a definite Commodore 64 feel to it. Bright primary colours and smiling characters are used to tell the tale of Kid's journey to rescue his girlfriend.[CR]The levels feature an assortment of enemies to kill, including snakes, elves and crocodiles, as well as flames and spinning wheels. Many of these appear during the level, forcing you to plan for them. You have 10 lives, but the loss of one resets the level to its original state. The initial coin-throwing is pretty weedy, but better weapons (as well as extra lives and smart bombs) can be bought in the shop, which appears every 5 screens.[CR]The levels are flick-screen, and can usually be finished in different ways, which results in different starting positions on the next screen, and you can travel back and forth through them, for example to pick up bonuses which are visible but not accessible as the level starts.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kid Gloves is a single-screen platformer game in which the goal is to head from the left side to the other. It was released for the Atari ST and Amiga in Europe. It was also followed by a sequel: Kid Gloves 2.Obstructing the player are various obstacles like ladders, falling blocks, enemies, locked doors and instant-death fireballs and spikes. Each screen carries with it an invisible timer which adds extra enemies and traps after a certain time limit is passed. The player must carefully anticipate these new additions as they move across the stage. Players can find money and buy upgraded weapons and consumable power-ups from the occasional shop, similar to platformers like Wonder Boy in Monster Land. After every ten screens the player is warped to a different time era.[CR]</plot>

The blue bullets attacks the armour of the tanks, the green the shield and the red the life. When you reduce armour, shield or life points from your opponent, you increase your own. This opens up new strategic possibilities like for example, eating the shield of an opponent with green bullets to better kill it with the red ones.The opponents are able to fight together using a number of strategies.</plot>

			<plot>In the dark future the new brutal sports game will be invented - Killerball - a blend of American Football, Roller-Skating, and Pinball. The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole.[CR]The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.</plot>

			<plot>Killing Cloud is set in a San Francisco ravaged by an opaque orange death smog layer known as the Killing Cloud. This hovers around the middle of the skyscrapers, creating a claustrophobic low level experience (and a different feel to the many other flight simulations set in the city, such as F/A-18 Interceptor). [CR]In this maelstrom, the Black Angel gang is terrorising the public.[CR]The player is a member of the SFPD Police force, charged with bringing them down throughout ten missions.  Some are out-and-out action while others are more strategic. You can only survive for 20 minutes in the smog, so time is crucial in these missions.[CR]In addition to outflying the enemy on your hoverbike, the player must carefully pre-position ground forces to arrest him when he is brought down, using Pick-Up Pods. Once arrested, a suspect must be interrogated to release enough information to know what the next threat is.</plot>

For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.[CR]   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.[CR]   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.[CR]   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.[CR]   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.[CR]   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.[CR]   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</plot>

			<plot>After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. [CR]King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually a verb/noun sequence. Like the first game, a good knowledge of fairy tales is required to solve some puzzles.</plot>

			<plot>King Graham and Queen Valanice were glad to have their children back. Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. [CR]King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female as a lead character. As Rosella, you will meet characters that will either help or hinder you. You move Rosella around with arrow keys, and perform actions by typing commands. [CR]Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, KQ IV uses the new SCI engine; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while you're typing, giving you time to give even the longest commands.</plot>

			<plot>Based on Avalon Hill's board game of the same name, Kingmaker is a strategy game set during the War of the Roses period of medieval England. You can play either York, or Lancaster, and your goal is to get your choice for royal heir crowned king of England. You do this by granting titles to people favorable to your cause, and eliminating those who would oppose it. Kingmaker has a simplistic combat interface, rather concentrating on politics and dirty tricks as the strategies of choice.</plot>

			<plot>A team of adventurers seek out four magic objects in the dungeons of Dunshelm: The Shield of Justice, the Sword of Freedom, the Cup of Life and the Crown of Glory. Equipped with these, they hope to destroy the evil Lord Fear. Treguard, the dungeon master of the Knightmare castle, appears as an oracle to help in their quest.[CR]Knightmare is a role-playing game and the second videogame adaptation of the homonymous British television series. It is very similar to the games of the Captive series, as it was developed by the same author. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the Dungeon Master one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with "stab", "swing" and "hack". A empty hand shows a menu with "punch" and "kick". The wand shows a list of available spells.[CR]The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.</plot>

			<plot>The world of Light is vanishing... No more glimmer, no more warmth, not even the slightest spark. Only you, Skrull the Barbarian, the incredible bastard son of the unnatural love between the Sun Woman and the Shadow Man, can free the Light again. But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...The game represents a Barbarian clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.</plot>

			<plot>Krypton Egg is a Breakout clone. Like in all such games, your goal on each level is to break all the bricks with a ball, which you bounce with a paddle, and try to save it from falling out of the level. [CR]Some bricks have a random power-up within them. There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. [CR]Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it. [CR]Each few levels, there comes a special action sequence where you try to defend yourself from a horde of incoming monsters, or defeat a boss by shooting it and avoiding its missiles.</plot>

			<title_clean>Laser Squad</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Laser Squad is a turn-based strategy game from the late 80's designed by Jullian Gollop,    Target Games.  The  basic premise is squad-based assault, assassination or rescue missions.   You start the game by selecting one of the missions.  In the original 8-bit versions the game  came with 5 missions with an expansion pack which was available by mail order supplied two  extra scenarios and some new weapons on the disc or cassette.  [CR]Original Missions[CR] The Assassins  The AssassinsThis mission saw you take a 5 man squad into the enemy hideout to assassinate a weapons  manufacturer by the name of Sterner Regnix.  The boss was hidden somewhere in the hideout and  was protected by a number of roaming security droids.   Moonbase AssaultMoonbase Assault You are given a slightly larger squad in this scenario.  You start outside the moonbase and  must enter and infiltrate the base using the available airlocks.  Once inside you have to  destroy a number of computers to wipe out their data.  Enemies line the corridors protecting  their moonbase.  Rescue from the MinesRescue from the Mines This scenario involved rescuing three of your squadmates who were being held captive in the  Metallix mines.  Once rescued your goal is then to escape.  The Cyber HordesThe Cyber Hordes Your job in this scenario is to defend a station against an attack from an advancing droid  invasion.  Protect the base's cores and survive.  Paradise ValleyParaside Valley Escape scenario involving the capture of blueprints for an advanced starfighter.  Escape with  the blueprints and don't let it get into the enemies hands. Squad Based Tactics:  Deploying TroopsEach scenario gives you a different size of squad to start out with.  The Assassins is a  small-scale skirmish and infiltration so you start off with only 5 squad members while in  Moonbase Assault the size of the base is considerably larger so your squad size is increased  to allow better strategic deployment.    Before you deploy your squad you must first select their armour and weaponry.  This is where the strategy begins as you have Armour Selection limited amount of resources to spend on armour and weaponry.  The Armour can go from grade 1 to 4 and costs between 6-19 creds.  Once you have equipped your squad with armour you manually select the weapon(s) each unit will carry, including secondary weapons, extra ammo and grenades. [CR]Platforms[CR]Originally released in 1988 on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and then quickly released on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST and MSDOS PC shortly after. [CR]Laser Squad 2[CR]The prototype of the sequel was shown off to many publishers and was picked up my   Microprose and became the X-com series which first started with UFO: Enemy Unknown (or  X-com: UFO Defense)[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Laser Chess is a chess variant for two players. The goal is same as in traditional chess game - defeat the opponent's king. The gameplay is enhanced by laser weaponry, although the players may choose the standard way of playing. The player may manipulate (by moving and rotating) all the pieces. There are eight types of pieces with special abilities, such as splitting or absorbing the laser beam. Basically most of the pieces are covered with mirrors reflecting the laser beam. Laser piece fires a laser beam in a straight line into a mirror piece placed opposite. The laser beam reflected by the mirror moves forward until it hits another mirror (including opponent's one), wall (beam disappears), absorbing piece (beam disappears) or destructible piece (including own one). The king and the laser have no mirror protection, some of the other pieces are protected only on the selected sides and the diagonal piece can't be destroyed by a laser beam, because all of its surfaces are reflective. The loss of the king means the end the game, the loss of the laser - the necessity of playing chess in the traditional way. </plot>

On the planet Bacula, the Galden Tribe has overthrown the government and seized power over the whole world. Now they want more &#8211; by invading the peaceful planet of Mu and kidnapped Queen Sheets.The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked their best scientists to come up with a weapon that will defeat the Galdens. After many long months, they were able to develop a vehicle of immense firepower, capable of leaping into the air to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it can transform into an airborne vessel whose purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the sky.Players have to guide their vehicle through six difficult levels - alternating between ground vehicle and fighter plane &#8211; while destroying every Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, holes in the ground need to be avoided, as players lose one of their ships should they happen to fall through one. Shooting power pods scattered around the level allows the player to increase their firepower. However, they lose that firepower if one of their ships is destroyed.</plot>

			<plot> This is the last game of the Last Ninja series. The final combat between Armakuni, the Last Ninja, and his arch rival, the evil shogun Kunitoki, is drawing near. Although The Last Ninja destroyed all the reminders of the evil shogun's existence both at Lin Fen and in modern day New York, he is still troubled by the fact that the shogun had slipped through his grasp both times. He knows that it is just a question of time before he once again will have to fight the shogun and his henchmen again, the only question is where and when. Then, suddenly, the ninjitsu spirits summon upon him once again, and take him to an inaccessible Buddhist temple deep into Tibet. These temples are the very heart of Ninjitsu power, this is where the Ninja brotherhood draws its strength from. The shogun is trying to corrupt these temples, in order to destroy the powers twice denied him by Armakuni. In this beautiful and remote setting, the ninja both has to fence off the shogun's fierce and vigilant guards, and complete several puzzles that blocks his way on to the final stand-off between himself and his old adversary. The puzzles include picking up and combining objects, and also manipulating his surroundings so that he may complete his task. All this while the shogun waits for the time to come that he may complete his evil plans. Gameplay consists of the main character walking from screen toscreen collecting this, and using that, solving puzzles and kicking plentyof arses along the way. The levels are relatively simple layouts of about 20 screens viewed in a 3D isometric perspective, some levels aredeliberately complex mazes however. The rather clever control systemallows you to move the central character around his pseudo 3D universevery realistically and subtly.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>The Last Ninja</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Last Ninja is the first game in System 3's Last Ninja series, and is one of the best regarded games to be released on the Commodore 64. It also eventually saw releases for various 8-bit US and European computers. A graphically enhanced version of this game, Last Ninja Remix, was released for various 16-bit computers. It is also one of the few C64 games on the Wii's Virtual Console, added in 2008 (Europe)/2009 (US).A Jaleco-published NES version (US only) was released as The Last Ninja, but this was in fact a port of the sequel Last Ninja 2.The game is depicted with an isometric viewpoint, and is somewhat open and dependent on adventure game style puzzles. The player is the eponymous last ninja, and is tasked with avenging his fallen clan.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Last Ninja takes place in a time when the strongest of the Japanese clans reaches the pinnacle of their decadent lifestyle. Appalled and oppressed, the peasants retreat into the mountains. Deep in the mountains they establish the secret art of the ninjutsu. Several centuries later they become the strongest and fiercest warriors of all Japan. Kunitoki, the merciless ruler of the Ashakagi Clan, envies their power and so takes an oath to achieve their total destruction. Once every decade all Ninja must travel to the Island of Lin Fen where they pay homage to the shrine of the White Ninja and receive further teachings from the Koga Scrolls. Seeing his best opportunity to destroy them all he amasses his forces and strikes without mercy. Every single Ninja is slaughtered in this treacherous ambush.Unknown to Kunitoki, the tradition of the Ninja is to leave one of their own behind to guard the holy shrine of Bunjinkan. Armakuni, now the last Ninja, soon learns of the genocide of his people and swears to destroy Kunitoki. From his childhood, Armakuni remembers the secret passageway that would lead him to the palace of Kunitoki on the impregnable island of Lin Fen. He travels to Lin Fen only to find out that the secret passage to the castle is not as he remembered. His quest for revenge begins...[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Last Ninja contains a combination of exploration, puzzle and combat game mechanics. Since the game has an isometric perspective, there are eight directions the character can move in. However, where Armakuni can move is also defined by pre-existing paths within the game (making some scenery inaccessible). Throughout the game a variety of weapons become available to the player, including a sword, nunchaku, shuriken, staff and smoke bomb(s). By kneeling at certain in-game landmarks, such as Buddha statues or fountains, the player can gain some insight into what they are supposed to do next, a sort of in-game help system. The game also "scales" as the player progresses, making the enemies progressively more difficult towards the end.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The island of Lin Fen is split into six distinct districts, each with their own assortment of items and challenges. The six areas (in the order they must be completed in) are:The Wastelands: A bright green grassland surrounded by a rocky landscape, 25 squares total. Here the player must jump from rock to rock in order to collect the essential items from the area. The player must also deal with a large fire-breathing dragon who roams around the Wastelands.The Wilderness: A diverse area with mountain ranges, caves and a bamboo forest that coves a total of 27 screens (the largest area). To complete it, Armakuni must climb his way up a steep cliff by using precise pin-point jumping.The Palace Gardens: a scenic, peaceful area adorned with pictures of flying white doves, grand waterfalls and magnificent flower beds that covers 25 screens. There is a Buddha shrine in this area, along with a lurking blue dragon.The Dungeons: Armakuni gets dropped through a trap door to this haunting area filled with torture chambers that spans 24 screens. Here lie spiders, rats, ghosts and skeletons that all seek to bar the player's progress.The Palace: Decorated with Asiatic furniture, the Palace's 15 screens are filled with highly trained guards that will do everything they can to thwart Armakuni's progress. Also, in the hallway there is a particularly difficult sword-throwing statue that requires the player to remain close to the wall in order to pass safely.The Inner Sanctum: Covering 15 screens, the final area features a secret passage and a notorious archer statue leading up to the final confrontation with an armored Kunitoki. After the player defeats him, he finally relinquishes the scrolls.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]A fun note about one of the two composers of the music for the C64 and Amiga versions of The Last Ninja: Ben Daglish got offered Mark Cale of System 3's slightly-dodgy left-hand-drive BMW as pay for his amazing efforts. Ben aptly responded "no thanks, I'll have the cash please." and that was that. Seemingly a good deal as the car itself wasn't worth much and the actual pay Ben received per tune for the game was about $300.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>When converting the original Leader Board golf simulation to the 16-bit systems, Sculptured took advantage of the power of these systems by adding trees, bunkers and rough, thus increasing the variety of the challenge. The same basic features still exist in terms of shot styles, and in the way a 72-hole contest can be arranged through a variation of the 4 provided 18-hole courses. Hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to affect shot angle, then use the right button to fire the shot away.</plot>

			<plot>A squad of four tough-guy soldiers have to take out some foes in a jungle. As the game starts, four soldiers are depicted, with any who are not present to play killed immediately - a joystick adaptor is required for 3 or 4 player games.[CR]Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.[CR]Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.</plot>

			<plot>In Leavin' Teramis the titular space ship gets conquered by aliens. The whole crew has managed to flee - except Nigel MacGibbons who slept through the evacuation due to his nightly drinking activities. Now he needs to reach the last escape pod by finding his way through ten levels, all with a big boss at the end.From an overhead perspective, the player controls MacGibbons through the corridors and rooms of the ship, scrolling in multiple directions. Despite controlling a human instead of a ship, the game is a straight shooter: using a gun to kill everything that moves while dodging enemy attacks and bullets. Getting hit reduces the energy bar and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Special symbols give advantages when picked up, like extra time on the time limit, extra lives or weapon upgrades.</plot>

			<plot>Leeds United Champions! is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.</plot>

			<plot>Legend of Faerghail is role-playing game with an interface similar to that of the Bards Tale Series or Dragon Wars, although it is a little more complex.[CR]You can create a party of six members and then try to stop a crusade of slaughter of the elvish race, that has been corrupted by an unspeakable evil. The game is played across 8 large dungeons with over 1000 rooms each, with 80 different foes in total. The game is very complex and therefore intended for an experienced player only...</plot>

			<plot>The evil sorcerer Suzar and his army of mutated humanoids attacked the land of Anar and defeated its bravest warriors in a bloody battle. You were the only one who was able to escape. You were picked up by a royal merchant ship and brought to the king Darius. The people of Anar know the ancient legends, that tells about magical sword and shield, whose power alone is able to defeat Suzar. You and five other adventurers have volunteered to venture into the wilderness of Anar and to retrieve the magical items.[CR]Legend of the Sword is a fantasy adventure game with slight RPG elements (top-down view, day and night cycle, world map exploration, traditional RPG plot, etc.). But the core gameplay is that of a pure puzzle-solving adventure. You interact with the environment by typing commands, and only a few of them are represented by icons (movement in eight directions as well as going in and out).</plot>

			<title_clean>Leisure Suit Larry 2 - Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking For Love in Several Wrong Places</title_clean>
			<plot>Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (In Several Wrong Places) is the second game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. Continuing the plot of the previous game, the swinging single Larry Laffer has finally found his true love and is happily living with her. Right? Wrong!.. Because Larry is mercilessly thrown out by his great love and is left all alone, penniless, and womanless, in Los Angeles. Accidentally, Larry comes into contact with KGB agents who will pursue him all over the globe from now on. And there is also the evil doctor Noontonyt plotting evil schemes on a remote tropical island... Looks like Larry will have to forget about his women-related problems for now... or is it so?The second game in the series introduces an improved engine (allowing for full-screen graphics and mouse control for movement). As opposed to the first game, which relied on exploration of one large area, the sequel has a more linear progression, the player being continuously taken to new locations as dictated by the plot. There are less puzzles in this installment than in the previous game; however, the number of ways to die has increased, danger awaiting Larry in most places he visits.</plot>

			<plot>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.[CR]Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Lemmings 2 - The Tribe</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lemmings 2: Tribes is the sequel to DMA Design's earlier puzzle hit Lemmings and takes its name from the 12 tribes of lemmings that inhabit the island on which the game takes place. The island is divided into twelve regions, one for each tribe. Some tribes differ in color, but all are controlled in the same way. Some abilities are specific to certain tribes, while others are reused several times.The land of each tribe has its own visual style and music, and some unique challenges.Psygnosis published the game in the US and Europe. SunSoft would produce the Japanese console versions, as they had with Lemmings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Land of the LemmingsThe game features 120 levels split equally between the 12 tribes. When the 10 levels of any tribe are complete, a segment of a talisman is awarded. When all 12 pieces of talisman are united, the island of the lemmings will be saved.Over 50 types of lemming are featured in Tribes, compared to just 8 of the original game.Each Tribe starts with 60 lemmings. In a significant departure from other Lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived could proceed to the next level, which might lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring earlier levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze are awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.Gameplay additions not related to the lemmings themselves include hazards and challenges specific to each environment, and the interface features an additional 'fan' icon, which allows drifting lemmings to be blown along.Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Tribes of Lemmings 2:Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)SpaceThe Lemmings of the Twelve TribesArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker*returning from the original Lemmings.

			<title_clean>Lethal Weapon</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lethal Weapon is an action platformer game from Eurocom and was created to coincide with the third Lethal Weapon movie, which was released the same year. The cover art is taken from the movie poster for Lethal Weapon 3. The game includes elements from the movie (such as the antagonist Jack Travis and Joe Pesci's returning comic relief character Leo Getz) but doesn't closely follow the plot.NES and Game Boy VersionThis version is a side-scroller brawler/shooter in which the player assumes either Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson's character) or Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover's character) and fights through hordes of criminals with their guns and fists. The player can also throw grenades should they find any, which can clear out small groups of enemies at once.Super Nintendo VersionIn this platformer, the player controls either both Riggs and Murtaugh - Riggs fires faster and Murtaugh jumps higher (presumably no offense was meant) - and plays through five missions set in different locations. The fifth and final stage has the duo arrest Jack Travis and recover the stolen weapons around which the movie focuses.Test edit. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>After the events of Wings of Death, the once evil sorcerer Sagyr has been reintegrated into society and only does good things with his magic. Unfortunately, one day he stumbles upon a curse which releases an evil witch called Xandrilia. She immediately conquers the world and teleports Sagyr 3 000 years into the future. Using a spaceship, his only hope to free the world is to destroy the planet Metallycha, where Xandrilia's heirs live.Just like its predecessor, Lethal Xcess is a vertically scrolling shooter. The graphics are less fantasy-oriented than its predecessor, in favour of a combination between high technology and plantlife. Your spaceship no longer morphs according to powerups picked up, but the basic weapon system is still there, only expanded. Eight different weapon systems are now available, each of which can be upgraded multiple times. Other powerups are extra speed, smart bombs and autofire. The skull-shaped "power-down" also rear their ugly heads again.Technologically, the game has also undergone great upgrades since its predecessor. The playfield is now larger, and up to 150 sprites can be displayed on screen on the Atari ST, more on STE machines. In fact, the game was put out on dual-format disks which boot both on Amigas and Ataris. Another new feature is a simultaneous two-player mode.</plot>

			<plot>A "James Bond" action/arcade game based on the movie with the same name. Your aim is to avenge the death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the drug baron Sanchez.Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on shooting, while others test your reflexes.</plot>

			<title_clean>Life and Death</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Life &amp; Death, players assume the role of an abdominal surgeon at Toolworks general hospital. This originally black and white game allowed the player to interact with the environments in a point and click interface. In this precursor to Trauma Center, typical surgery instruments were available for the player to use in any order, as a close up of the patient's body is seen laying on the table. It is still one of only a few realistic medical games ever developed, allowing the player to diagnose treat a variety of conditions including kidney stones, arthritis and appendicitis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must prep the patient by scrubbing down, applying anesthesia, and cauterizing incisions. Before surgery, however, the player must make a visit to the patient's room, where he or she is allowed to study the patient's medial chart for any clues to diagnoses.You can start poking parts of the patients abdomen and see what they say (just don't poke to much). There are also a number of tools to help, like the x-ray.The game had an interesting bit of physical DRM. Most games of the time came with a dictionary or an instruction manual, and to play a new game you would have to type in a specific word on a specific page of that book. This led to much wasted copy paper. The physical DRM of Life and Death was a paper "beeper" that had multiple wheels to align. You would have to align the wheels according to a number that the receptionist gave you before you could start a case. The player can choose two members of the medial staff to accompany the surgery, offering expertise from their field. For example, the cardiologist will offer advice on the patient's blood flow, while the nurse walks the player through simple procedures, such as suturing and clamping.Once you have found out what's wrong with the patients (after a few deaths), you get to the best part of the game: OPERATING! This is by far the hardest part of the game. You'll have to follow all kinds of medical procedures. Incisions are made using the mouse. This is the only part of the game that is animated.Clicking on the various doors in the hospital will take the doctor to their labeled rooms. The School room debriefs players on previously failed cases, with the instructor offering specific criticism of the player's actions. He may comment that the player was "padding the bill" with unnecessary gauze or stitches, or that the player's "impersonation of Jack the Ripper" was unacceptable behavior. The School room also provides the player with a brief overview of diagnosing cases, and simple surgical steps. Once in the OR, the player can exit the surgery by calling the Chief Surgeon to step in and take over the job. At the time of release this game was unique in it's kind.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.[CR]There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.[CR]The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.</plot>

			<plot>Unusually, this Operation Wolf-influenced shoot 'em up sees you start behind enemy lines, and gradually attempting to escape. As you've captured the Rapier machine gun your enemy have been developing, there are plenty who can't bear to see the back of you unless it's bloodied and lifeless.[CR]The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of settings, vehicles and situations. You will have to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on foot. The levels are set in locations such as the enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the final flight back to your base.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Little Computer People is a life simulation game that was developed by Activision and was released in 1985. A port of the game was also released by Square on the Family Computer Disk System for the NES/Famicom console in Japan.The game received the accolade of 'Best Original Game of the Year' at the Golden Joystick Awards in 1985.The game is reported to have served as inspiration for The Sims, and shares a number of similarities with the series.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Game starts with an empty house, depicted as a cross-section. Eventually a male Little Computer Person (LCP) will come into the home with a pet, and explore the home's various rooms; a kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom, office, and den. A player can execute various commands to interact with the LCP and pet in each room of the house, or simply watch the LCP. Actions include delivering books, software, records, food, and dog food. The water tank may also be filled. The player may also operate a scissor expansion arm, connected to a hand which pats the LCP on the back.Additionally, the LCP will occasionally attempt to initiate an interaction with the player by "tapping" outward at the monitor, or by typing letters on the typewriter in the den.Within the office is a computer, which various games-within-a-game can be played with the LCP, including Hearts, Poker, and Hangman. There are no defined goals, but the player must supply both the LCP and the pet with food, water, and entertainment, or the LCP grows bored, and even sick, as evidenced through terse typewriter messages, and a green complexion.Left to his own devices, the LCP keeps himself occupied by listening to records, playing the piano, using his comptuter, reading, and watching television. Any of these actions may be initiated by the player as well through a text interface, which acts as an instant message to the LCP.[CR]</plot>

This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.[CR]The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.[CR]This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</plot>

The game includes day and night stages, along with different weather conditions such as fog and snow. There is also a workshop option where you can repair and tweak your car to get a bit of extra speed. The game's main innovation is that the screen display is from behind the front seats - you can see the driver adjusting the steering wheel and gearstick, and the co-driver holds a map which changes colour as the track is covered.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Loom, players take control of young  Bobbin Threadbare. Following cataclysmic events early in the game, Bobbin goes on a quest of fate and prophecy. Throughout the story, players interact with an enchanted swan with whom Bobbin is mysteriously connected.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The interface in Loom is unlike any of the other  SCUMM games; Bobbin interacts with his surroundings by using a musical distaff (a traditional weaving tool), which replace the standard adventure game commands. Musical phrases played on the distaff control Bobbin's surroundings in various ways. In the harder difficulty setting, the distaff's notation is removed, and the player must correctly select the correct area of the distaff to play specific notes, without assistance. The distaff can play a full 8 notes, from middle C to C. Four-note "Drafts", or musical phrases can be played backwards for the opposite affect, on occasion; ECED will open, DECE will close. While well received, the game didn't sell as well as Lucasfilms had hoped; a planned sequel never was created.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]If a player chooses expert mode (there are no markings or assistance in playing the distaff), Bobbin's hooded face is revealed at the games finale.Loom is referenced in a few other  LucasArts games, most notably  The Secret of Monkey Island. Examples include a minor Loom character appearing as the pirate in the  SCUMM bar who shamelessly advertises Loom, as well as  Guybrush's reaction to  Meathook. A dialogue selection from that event reads "I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?" Meathook replies, "Your mother was a duck." in reference to the swan from Loom. A seagull from Loom can also be found by the water outside the SCUMM Bar kitchen.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The original release of Loom came with an audio cassette containing a 30 minute dramatized prologue for the game.All the music in Loom is from the 1877 ballet "Swan Lake" by Tchaikovsky.[CR]Rerelease[CR]Loom was re-released on Steam on July 8th, 2009 along with a few other LucasArts classic adventure games.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.[CR]Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.[CR]Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. [CR]Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.[CR]The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</plot>

			<title_clean>Lord of Chaos</title_clean>
			<plot>Lords of Chaos is a fantasy turn-based tactics game written by Julian Gollop in 1990. It is the sequel to Chaos also written by the same author. In Lords of Chaos you control a wizard casting spells to summon creatures, or damaging opposing creatures and wizards. Some spells require ingredients, and some ingredients, such as dragon herb become important strategic acquisitions. Unlike chaos the large maps scroll and are uncovered as you explore. The game can be played against a computer-controlled opponent or by up to four human players. When playing single player the experience gained improves your wizard giving access to better spells and giving you the edge in multi-player battles. Expansions were released which game new maps for single and multi-player battles.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>You and your squad are on their way back from R&amp;R in Saigon to your operations base when Viet Cong guerillas force your helicopter to crash land in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It's now your responsibility to lead the remaining survivors to the nearest U.S. base, evading or facing an elusive and dangerous enemy on his own grounds.[CR]Most of the time, you'll see a map of the country on the screen and navigate your men through the country. It's important to watch your men's health and morale by getting them food, water, ammo and letting them rest, etc. When reaching certain spots on the map, e.g. a native village, the game presents the current situation in a nice graphic scene. Sometimes you'll run into V.C. snipers, patrols, whole ambushes or encounter minefields. Then the game offers some small arcade sequences like firing your guns or fighting it out in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The progress of your party is accompanied by video sequences from the Vietnam War.</plot>

			<plot>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton.[CR]The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.[CR]You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</plot>

			<plot>Licensed by the classic British car company, this game featured 2 modes of play - one has you racing against 19 computer rivals (with witty names such as Alain Phosphate and Crash-Hard Banger), and the other pits you against the clock. There are 13 different types of races, ranging from Motorways to night-time to sections punctuated by roadworks, and some are lap-based with others being simple A-B. 2 players could play on a split screen mode.The game's crowning glory, however, was the RECS editor, which allowed you to create courses of your own, with theoretically millions possible.</plot>

			<plot>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.[CR]You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.[CR]You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. [CR]You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</plot>

			<plot>A very encompassing game that allowed players to issue orders to Tanks, AA units, Aircraft, Artillery and Infantry in a campaign against Warsaw Pact units in Europe, while specifically controlling a platoon of 4 M1 tanks.  The player could jump into the position of the driver, gunner or commander of any of the tanks to view the world from a 1st person perspective, or work from a tactical map to command all his forces.  Characters in the M1 platoon actually increased in skill as they survived battles.</plot>

			<plot>The MiG-29 plane, nicknamed Fulcrum by the West, features in this flight simulation, professionally modeled by former British Aerospace flight simulator designers. You are armed with cannons, rockets and Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground missiles. Aerodynamics, blackouts and physics are all recreated. There are six missions to take on, starting with your basic training. [CR]After this, there are four diverse missions with colour-coded identification, and a final extra-tough mission you can only do once you have successfully completed the others. The missions involve arctic reconnaissance, dogfighting over the Great Wall of China, an oil refinery, and destroying terrorist infrastructure. Your final task involves destroying a nuclear plant in the desert. Missions have primary and secondary objectives affecting scoring.</plot>

			<plot>In Magic Boy the player controls the aptly named "Magic Boy" and has to complete stages by defeating all of the enemies in a given level. The bulk of the gameplay involves platform jumping and shooting pellets out of Magic Boy's wand. When an enemy is hit with the pellets they are stunned and Magic Boy can collect them in his bag. If an enemy is left in the bag too long without the player dumping the enemy then Magic Boy dies a horrible, horrible death.  [CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 6,5,5,6 and 5 out of ten.  Mike Weigand wrote, "Here is another game that has great ideas (like being able to grab stunned enemies and carry them around with you), but they get almost completely lost in the poor control.  The colors are beautiful and very well done".[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Your enemy have designed a new fighter craft, the Moth. The only prototype is held in a network of caves within an asteroid, heavily protected by 30 different types of craft. As a pilot of the T2 'Magic Fly' craft, it is your job to find and destroy the Moth.[CR]You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.[CR]Accurate steering and shooting are not enough  puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons (types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles), each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Magic Pockets is a platform game produced by the Bitmap Brothers, released in 1991.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Magic Pockets, the player takes control of the Bitmap Kid who has magical pockets with an infinite capacity. Magic Pockets had four main areas and the weapons that the Bitmap kid pulls from his pockets to fling at oncoming enemies change in each of the areas. The weapons can be charged by holding down the attack button, when at their highest charge the weapons can suck up enemies, Which each area came a new power which could effect the environment to your advantage. The first power are whirlwinds which could break blocks and after throwing a full power shot and jumping into it would shoot you up in the form of a super jump. The 2nd level had clouds which after a full shot could both provide an extra ledge to jump on and, after it evaporates, a drop of water forms and if it hits a seed on the ground it will start to grow vines allowing you to reach extra parts of the level. The 3rd had you using ice blocks which could freeze the tops of lakes so you could walk across them. Finally you used snowballs in the last stage, if dropping a low power shot onto the ground and walking into it caused that shot to build up into a full power picking up snow basically providing a shield.To defeat each level meant getting to the exit door, each level could contain multiple exits in the more open ended levels. After reaching the exit you would receive bonus points depending on your achievements (How many baddies you had killed, how many stars you collected, how many sweets you ate) but, as the main story line suggest, you have to find and recover your toys in the levels from the baddies and take them to the exit. Like the powers the 4 levels have a toy to find.  1. The bike - Jumping on it makes you invincible and tapping the buttons pedal and you tore through packs of baddies.2. The boxing glove - Picking up removed your powers but again you are invincible and can punch and kill baddies in on hit leaving behind a 1000 point coin.3. The diving helmet - Allows you to dive and swim in water without being hurt.4 .The Space hopper - Makes you invincible and of course you can jump much higher and land on baddies, killing them.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The Magic Pockets game was used as a phone in competition on the British Saturday morning children's programme "Motormouth". Contestants would observe the game in their television at home whilst shouting instructions down the phone. The theme music for Magic Pockets was the song 'Doin' the Do' by Betty Boo which had previously charted at number 7 in the English Single charts in September 1990.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>This is an immersive isometric game where you start by having no clue about your mission. You drive a tank which moves under heavy inertia via directional controls, and bumps into walls and can only shoot.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] resembles titles such as Alien 8 and Sweevo's World. Some blocks can be pushed, some move after you shoot them, while some can be used for lifts. Most rooms have multiple exits, but some are locked and others aren't on the same vertical level. Avoid lasers and blocks, solve puzzles by pushing or triggering blocks, and finally solve your quest.</plot>

[CR]The car is mounted with guns, and so are many enemy cars, but cars can be rammed off the road as well as shot. Watch out for other enemy vehicles such as helicopters though; be sure to avoid their bullets.[CR]You can drive into the back of open lorries to gain upgraded weapons. Weapons are activated via keyboard presses, which makes the game more difficult than it would otherwise be. Sound and music sampled from suitably action-packed films aims to add to the atmosphere.</plot>

			<title_clean>Manhunter - New York</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Manhunter: New York is a 1988 adventure game, developed using Sierra Entertainment's Adventure Game Interpreter tool. However, unlike the majority of Sierra's other adventure games from the period, it does not use a text parser. Instead, it uses a point-and-click interface and a first-person viewpoint. The distinctively gritty visual art style for the time, alongside the unique interface and the in-game inclusion of several real-life locations from New York, helped to distance Manhunter from the rest of Sierra's catalogue, which up until then had been extremely family friendly, with titles such as the King's Quest series.The game does not include any pre-recorded dialogue, but relies upon text bubbles to convey important all plot-critical information. The major gameplay mechanics involve tracking down individuals in New York by locating their addresses across the city. Although point-and-click, Manhunter does not actually use a mouse; the cursor is moved across the screen using the keyboard directional arrows. If the player has access to a mouse, it is only used to demonstrate the current location of the cursor, rather than move.A sequel, Manhunter 2: San Francisco, was released in 1989.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Set in (the then futuristic) year 2004, the Earth has been invaded by a race of aliens known as the Orbs. These aliens appear as enormous floating eyes, and observe the humans during their daily lives. The Orbs have also implanted every human with a tracking device and complex monitoring equipment, dressed them in regimental uniforms and forbidden all forms of speech or communication. The populace have been enslaved into believing the Orbs are actually their benevolent leaders, and have no knowledge of their previous lives. The protagonist has been tasked by the Orbs to infiltrate and destroy a group of humans who are believed to be attempting to form an underground resistance movement.During the game, the protagonist witnesses the true evil of the Orbs regime, in that they are actually slowly harvesting the entire human race as a source of food (similar to the plot of the film Soylent Green). After discovering the truth, the protagonist joins with the resistance and tries to overthrow the Orbs by force.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Picking up immediately where Manhunter: New York left off, Manhunter 2: San Francisco has the player crash-landing their stolen ship in the City by the Bay after trying unsuccessfully to keep up with enigmatic serial killer Phil.  Left with no alternatives, the player assumes the identity of a local Manhunter and solves more crimes for the alien Orbs while searching for Phil and working for the local human resistance.[CR]Manhunter 2 presents the same urban decay and oppressive alien invader regime as visualized in the original, this time using streets and landmarks from the Bay Area. The Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Alcatraz prison, and the TransAmerica Pyramid all receive alien makeovers. New puzzles, new characters, and new investigations await as the player tracks Phil by his string of strangled corpses.[CR]All concepts and gameplay elements from Manhunter: New York return.  The player again uses the MAD tracking device to follow suspects provided by the alien Orbs and uses clues found through first-person location investigation to discover the suspects' name.  Occasional arcade sequences bring mixed challenges, and though they cannot be skipped, a new difficulty option has been implemented. The same point-and-click gameplay (no typing required) is used to navigate the game world.</plot>

			<title_clean>Maniac Mansion</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Maniac Mansion is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games first released in 1987 on the Commodore 64. The game was later ported to the Apple II, Atari ST, Macintosh, Amiga, DOS and Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first game to be built in SCUMM, a game engine and scripting tool for which LucasArts became very well known and in which the "MM" stands for Maniac Mansion specifically.The player, primarily controlling the character of Dave Miller, is tasked with rescuing Dave's girlfriend Sandy Pantz from the mansion of Dr. Fred, a mad scientist who kidnapped her for use in his human experiments. The Edison family of which Dr. Fred is a member occupy the mansion. The mansions other occupants are Nurse Edna (Dr. Fred's wife), Weird Ed (their son), as well as one large purple tentacle and one large green tentacle. If any of the family members excluding the green tentacle will kill or capture Dave and his friends if they discover them. While the plot may sound serious, the game takes advantage of a number of B movie tropes as well as a very unique style of humor that sets the game play in a funny and mostly non-threatening light.The game play utilizes a point-and-click mechanic that became the standard for most all LucasArts game of the time period (and has seen a resurgence again in recent years). In addition to this, the game contains 15 different commands that they player may use to interact with the environments and characters.The commands are: Push, Pull, Give, Open, Close, Read, Walk To, Pick Up, What Is, New Kid, Unlock, Use, Turn On, Turn Off, and Fix. In addition to these choices, the player is also granted a number of special abilities depending on the characters that have been chosen to accompany Dave. For example, Bernard can repair items while Michael can develop film.Most of the story is conveyed through the use of cut scenes. In the game's opening cinematic, it is revealed that a meteor landed near the mansion twenty years prior to the game's event, that the meteor is sentient, and that it has taken control of the family, making them into the evil characters that they are.Maniac Mansion has five successful endings that change depending on which characters are used, which characters have died, and how the player solved certain puzzles throughout the game.Like many other games of the time, Lucasfilm Games was required to heavily censor Maniac Mansion before it could be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Because of this, the NES version is considered to be a somewhat incomplete and lacking experience overall.A sequel to Maniac Mansion titled Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle was released in 1993. As a bit of fan service, LucasArts included a full and playable version of Maniac Mansion could be found and played through an in-game computer.A television series based loosely on the game aired from 1990 to 1993 on The Family Channel (United States) and YTV (Canada).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There were several different characters in Maniac Mansion that changed the way you could solve the puzzles and finish the game.Dave: Sandy&#180;s boyfriend and the main characterSyd: A new wave musician that is able to play instrumentsMichael: A amateur photographer that is able to develop filmWendy: A novelist that has writing skillsBernard: A nerd that can manipulate/repair various items in the gameRazor: A female punk-rocker that is able to play instrumentsJeff: A surfer without many helpful skillsYour party consists of three characters with Dave being mandatory. Unlike other LucasArts games, the player could die in Maniac Mansion but finish the game with two characters theoretically.[CR]Non-playable Characters[CR]Mansion inhabitants and others:Dr. Fred: The mad scientist 20 years in the making.Ed: Dr. Fred's son whom is concerned for his father and what he's doing in the basement of their mansion.Nurse Edna: Crazy old lady. Don't steal her food!Dead Cousin Ted: A mummified cousin, found in the families sarcophagus.Hamster: Ed's pet, but don't go near the microwave with this little guy.Green Tentacle: A friendly tentacle, craving the munchies and really wanting to get his band started.Purple Tentacle: Under Dr. Fred's orders, the Purple Tentacle is bent on world destruction.Sandy: Dave's girlfriend and town cheerleader, captured by Dr. Fred.Mark: Founder for, "Three Guys Who Will Publish Anything". Haven't you seen his ads on TV?Space Police: Searching forever for their meteor. Might have to get in contact with them.[CR]Conception[CR]Maniac Mansion was first conceived in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick. As part of a project assigned to them by Lucasfilm Games, the two wrote and designed a game based on their love of B movies and their own unique sets of humor.While they add the basic concepts for the plot, characters, and environment, the two designers had trouble determining a genre of game play. Only after watching his cousin play King's Quest: Quest for the Crown during a Christmas visit did Ron Gilbert decide that the graphic adventure game genre would be the best fit for their creation. From there, the two went about created a basic layout for the game in order to determine the overall structure of the game and preliminary programming concepts. At one point, Maniac Mansion was a board game playable on paper in which the mansion's floor plan was the game board and small markers were used to represent characters and items. Due to the complexity of the game's overall structure and the high number of variables, dialogue was not written until some time into the actual programming of the game.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Maniac Mansion is considered a seminal title in video game history. It was lauded for its preset number of commands that made it simpler to focus on puzzlers and where to go rather than what commands could and could not be used. Additionally, its humor-based storytelling set a standard that was followed up by a number of games including the Space Quest and Monkey Island series.The game's lasting effect on gaming culture can be seen in recent years as well in which fans have created a new version of the game featuring updated graphics and audio, an episodic series of games based on the universe, and live action trailers depicting a fictitious film based on the game.[CR]Changes in NES Version[CR]Due to the strict guidelines Nintendo of America placed on developers, several changes had to be made to the game in order to be released on the NES. Things like profanity had to be removed or edited, for instance Dave's opening line of "Don't be a shit head" was changed to "Don't be a tuna head" for the NES version.Other less noticeable things were changed in order to meet Nintendo's standards. For example in the Mansion's arcade room, an arcade machine named "Muff Diver" had to be changed to "Tuna Diver", or a medical chart in Dr. Fred's office originally had a caption for the brain that read "Chewy caramel center", which was changed to "Pretty brains"The characters themselves or some of the dialog involving characters had to be changed. One exchange between Ed &amp; Edna was as follows. "Well, Mommy, I'm worried about him. Well, Mommy, I'm worried! He hasn't eaten in 5 years. YEAH, SO!!! and he's been bringing those bodies, and he carries those bodies to the basement at night." Nintendo however felt that this exchange indicated that Dr. Fred was a cannibal, even though game designers insisted that was never their intention. The text was eventually changed to "He hasn't slept in 5 years!"Perhaps the biggest change to the NES version was to the character of Edna. In the earlier versions of the game some of her lines were somewhat sexually suggestive, for example when someone calls her from the phone in the library, she says "Is this a prank phone Call?

			<plot>Maniax is a Qix variant. The basic playing principle: the player controls a dot which can draw lines on the screen and when a closed figure is drawn, the colour of the area changes. Additionally there are enemies, either confined to the uncoloured or coloured areas, which cause the player sprite to die if touched. The goal is to colour 75% of the screen.This variant reveals background images taken from 16 cities instead of just changing the screen colour. There are also various extras to pick up which give advantages like extra lives, frozen enemies or extra points. Triangles show negative effects when picked up, e.g. instant death or deceleration.</plot>

			<plot>Manix is a puzzle game with 128 levels. The player takes the role of Filbert, a bouncing ball, who has a problem: there is war. Each level consists of a garden (surrounded by water) which is divided into squares with different colours. Before the level starts, the correct colour combination is shown, then grenades fall out of the sky and mess everything up. Now the player needs to bring back the original colours by bouncing on the squares: every touch changes the colour. If the correct colour is shown, it does not change anymore - at least until another grenade falls on it. To hinder the process, there are enemies and hazardous squares which should not be touched. There are also power ups to collect, that may add extra time to the time limit, change a few tiles to the correct colour, or reverse the controls.</plot>

			<title_clean>Marble Madness</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released as a trackball arcade game from Atari Games, Marble Madness was created, designed and programmed by developer Mark Cerny. The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64. Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first "killer apps" for the Amiga, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked "GOAL"). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no "lives remaining" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black "enemy" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill. Here, the player may "squash" formerly lethal enemies in one section. Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>There was a massive wave of football management games in 1992, and this was Zeppelin's contender. It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.</plot>

			<plot>In Mayday Squad, the Lutonian Embassy has been taken over by the Red Legion terror organisation and the ambassador's daughter has been kidnapped. The player takes the role of a group of three special agents which have to save her within a time limit. The player has to choose between nine soldiers which are divided into three categories: leader (shooting), demolition (grenades) and communication (opening locks and picking up items). The soldiers within the same category also have different advantages and weaknesses. Also chosen before starting the mission is the difficulty level and hit points of the team members.During the game itself, one member is controlled by the player and the others by the AI. However, to perform special actions it is possible to instantly switch between them. This is needed because there are a lot of options how to proceed in the maze-like embassy, e.g. players may choose to open a lock or shoot it open. While a large portion of the game is dedicated to finding the way and searching for clues which hint to the daughter's location, there are also strong action elements: When meeting enemies and controlling the leader, the cursor has to be quickly moved over the opponents to shoot them before they can damage the team. Resources like ammo are limited.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mean Streets places you in the role of Tex Murphy, private eye in a distopian futuristic California. The game is a classic adventure, with a unique mystery and pen-and-paper puzzle-solving. The game bills itself as 'An Interactive Detective Movie.'[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The beautiful Sylvia Linsky.Sylvia Linsky hires Tex to investigate the death of her father, Dr. Carl Linsky. Carl Linsky was believed to have committed suicide by jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. Sylvia does not believe her father would have ever committed suicide, and that his death must have been a murder. She knows her father was involved with a secret project that may be related to his death, but knows nothing about it. The player is tasked with solving the mystery.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Mean Streets, you are tasked with solving the mystery behind Carl Linsky's death. You will do this by one of two ways: (1) Investigating and interrogating characters, and (2) obtaining clues and items in the environment.[CR]Technology[CR]Mean Streets uses several advanced (at the time of release) pieces of technology. First, digitized graphics took advantage of the newly-released VGA graphics card standard, resulting in a look similar to Mortal Kombat or NARC.Access Software developed RealSound, a way to play back digitized sound through standard PC speakers. At the time, dedicated sound cards such as the SoundBlaster were still expensive, and this technology allowed for an approximation of their quality without the cost.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.[CR]The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</plot>

			<plot>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. [CR]Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.[CR]Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.[CR]Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.[CR]If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.[CR]The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. [CR]You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.</plot>

			<plot>Memory recall is a game to train your memory. There are twenty tiles on a board of size 4x5. Like in the board game Memory behind each tile/card an image is hidden. But unlike the board game, you do not have to find pairs, but got commands to find a certain image.There are two phases in the game: first you can freely explore the images and memorize them. Then in the bonus phase you get an request like "Find a tiger" and you get a higher score for finding it quicker with fewer turns. There are five difficulty levels. In the higher levels, you have shorter time to explore the cards freely and in the lower difficulties you also get information if the tile you turned is in the same column and row like the requested one.There are 20 digitized pictures in the game, and a high-score table for each of the difficulty levels.</plot>

			<plot>In this sequel to the game Mercenary, the planet Eris is in danger: A comet, fittingly named "Damocles", is on a straight collision course with the planet. Within only a few hours, the comet will obliterate Eris.It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy (which contains 9 planets and 19 moons) and try to find a way to stop the comet.Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!</plot>

			<plot>Mercs is a shoot 'em up influenced by Ikari Warriors. You are an anti-terrorism soldier, and must rescue a former President from a Central African revolutionary gang. [CR]You run through each of the 8 levels, which primarily scroll horizontally, shooting everyone before they can shoot you. At times you will have to shoot trees and other scenery to progress. [CR]Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</plot>

			<plot>Metal Mutant is an action game, where you control the eponymous machine, sent to the planet Kronox to find and destroy the insane computer AROD 7. Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. [CR]The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. [CR]Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]You're Winner!Metro-Cross is an early (1985) Namco Arcade game that was eventually ported to the Famicom and computers such as the C64 and Atari ST.The player is a contestant on the eponymous  futuristic game show Metro Cross. In order to win, the player must run along an obstacle course, jumping over giant  soda cans and hurdles, as well as avoiding green tiles that will slow them down. Every level has a very strict amount of time to finish with, but whatever time is left over from their first three rounds will carry on to the fourth.[CR][B]Power-ups:[/B][CR]Blue Soda Can: A small, stationary can of soda. Kicking this will earn points, stomping on it will give the player a temporary stop on the clock. The points they get depend on how many times the can has been kicked.Green Soda Can: A larger can. Kicking this will give the player a temporary burst of speed, and stomping it will stop the clock.Skateboard: Increases speed and lets the player move freely on green tiles, but jumping or getting hit will lose it. Getting on a skateboard when already on one will result in bonus points.Ramps: Yellow ramp-like trampolines often line the courses. They do almost nothing unless the player times their jump as they hit one, launching them several yards forward.[CR]Obstacles[CR]Sentient cans like to mess with the runner.Red Cola Can: These giant cans will often roll at the player in patterns. Jump on them and trip, run into them and get squished.Green Tiles: Stepping on these will drastically reduce speed. Avoid these.Hurdles: These are just normal hurdles. Jump over, or avoid them.Vents: These vents shoot what look like party favors underneath the player if they step on it, shooting them up several feet before landing, leaving them to recover for a second before running again.Mice: Some rounds have green mice that will latch on to the player, slowing them down for a bit. They will leave the player alone after a while, or they can get hit by something else to scare them away. Red Cube of Terror, relaxing at home.Giant Red Cube of Terror: This cube will rotate slowly along the Y-axis.Small Pool: These glassy, light-blue tiles will swallow the player up if jumped on.Pillars: These pillars move up and down rapidly, making jumps difficult to time.Bouncy Tires: These tires will bounce at the player. Run underneath them.Time Limit: Time limits are strict in this game, so stomp the hell out of some cans. Running out of time means  electrocution.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The main screen's theme music was later used as the musical backing to the "theme song" for Namco's 2009 PSN release  Noby Noby Boy.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The Ogre King and his minions have taken over Disney Castle, and it's Mickey's task to win it back. The game starts on a sequence of stairways, up which Mickey must move, shooting any creatures that get in his way. Eventually you will come to a door and go through it, at which point the second section of the game begins.These are viewed from above, and see Mickey negotiate his way through a multi-screen maze, with multiple exits on each screen. Ghosts and ogres block his path, but he's armed with a water pistol for the former and an axe for the latter, both of which need replenishing regularly. Some doors require keys to move through.There are several sub-games, including Pac-Man and Donkey Kong-derived games. To win the game you must finally beat the Ogre King.</plot>

			<title_clean>Midwinter</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Midwinter is a first-person action-espionage game released for Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and PC. The game had a sequel called Midwinter 2: Flames of Freedom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]First, there was the strategy aspect of the game, which took place on the 160,000-square-mile island of Midwinter, where you planned the moves of the Free Villages Peace Force in an attempt to stop the evil General Masters from taking over the island. Thirty-two agents with different skills were scattered across this vast environment, players were tasked with recruiting these characters.Meeting up with these agents required changing to the game's first-person action mode, where players skied across the frozen landscape. It was possible to snipe enemies at long range in this mode, and as the game progressed players would eventually commandeer several vehicles that were fully controllable.There were snow-buggies for quickly traversing the white wasteland, ski lifts for quickly getting to the tops of mountains, and hang gliders for getting down from said mountains (and attacking enemies from the air). Like the skiing, vehicles were controlled from a first-person perspective. The entire island was rendered with shaded 3D polygons.The sniping mode scope could be zoomed in, and the view would bob up and down as the agent breathed. Agents with better shooting skills suffered less from this effect. When skiing, it was possible to hit a tree while zipping down a steep slope, which usually knocked the agent out and sometimes did serious physical damage.Midwinter was one of the first games to model damage to specific body parts, and it affected performance in a realistic manner. Leg injuries slowed movement, and arm wounds severely affected shooting accuracy.Tired and wounded agents needed bed rest to recover fully. Also, certain agents didn't get along with one another, so players had to be careful during the recruiting process. The Midwinter remake was announced on the 9th of January 2014 and is due for release in Q1 2015 [CR]</plot>

			<plot>This sequel to Midwinter takes place years after the events of the first game.  The world has thawed and Midwinter has dissapeared beneath the ocean.  It's legacy, the Peaceful Atlantic Federation is facing an invasion by the slave trading Saharan Empire.  Between the two lie the Slave isles, a chain of islands under the oppressive thumb of the Saharans.You are a covert operative for the Atlantic Federation.  Your mission is to conduct assassinations, enlist rebels and sabotage the Saharans operations in the slave isles.  As you carry out these open-ended missions, the islands will rebel and aid your efforts when the Saharan invasion finally comes.Flames of freedom uses the same engine as Midwinter for land, air, and sea travel (and combat) but now, you control only a single customizable character.  A strategic map allows you to identify key islands for your cause and determine the mission objectives that will sway it's population to your cause.  Then, it's up to you to head in and carry out the mission as you see fit (perhaps guns first, perhaps with a big bag of money, perhaps just relying on your charm).Flames of Freedom mixes first person action with strategy, vehicle combat, and diplomacy for a unique gaming experience that carries on the Midwinter legacy.</plot>

The player needs to defuse every bomb in the area before they can progress, and can earn extra rewards by defusing the bombs in a specific order: one of the bombs will have a lit fuse, and this lit fuse continues moves to move from bomb to bomb as they get defused.Mighty Bomb Jack is considered a sequel to the Arcade game Bomb Jack. It was released in 1986 by Tecmo for the Famicom/NES and was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64. The NES version was later released on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2007, Nintendo 3DS in 2012 and Wii U in 2014.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]King Pamera was a legendary king who ruled the lands and ensured peace and order throughout the world. The King demon Belzebut had plans to bring the world to ruin by kidnapping King Pamera, along with his wife and daughter. The Mighty Brothers fought against Belzebut but all were defeated except the youngest, Jack. Jack must save the world by defeating Belzebut and rescuing the royal Pamera family, thus restoring peace and order to the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mighty Bomb Jack is a side-scrolling platformer with a number of unique mechanics. The titular Jack has the ability to jump very high, around the height of one screen. He can also stop his jump at any height by pressing the jump button again, allowing for more precise jumping. Jack can also float down during his descent, this is done by rapidly pressing the jump button while falling. Jack's last movement mechanic is the ability to rapidly descend by pressing down on the D-Pad while airborne. Jack&#8217;s mobility is his greatest defense. Jack also has the use of special abilities by increasing his Mighty Power, this is achieved by using Mighty Coins which will also change Jack&#8217;s color.Players must use Jack&#8217;s abilities to navigate a labyrinth of rooms inside a pyramid in order to rescue the royal family. At the end of each main stage is a Royal Palace room (bonus stage) in which Jack must collect all bombs on screen in order to proceed through the gate. Bonus points are awarded if Jack can collect the bombs in order, the order in which to collect is determined by a lit fuse.Another unique feature of this game is the addition of the Game Deviation Value (G.D.V.). This score is given to the player at the end of a game, and is apparently a score generated by the game based on reflexes, memory, and judgment.Mighty PowerMighty Power is the power up system used in Mighty Bomb Jack. Mighty Power is obtained by collecting mighty Coins. By using them Jack can increase his Mighty Power 3 times. Each tier gives Jack a new ability, and access to all lower tier powers. Beware of collecting too many Mighty Coins, if Jack collects more than nine (9) coins he will be sent to the Torture Room.&#183; Blue &#8211; Allows Jack to open the orange treasure boxes.&#183; Orange &#8211; Allows Jack to open red and orange boxes by simply touching the sides.&#183; Green &#8211; Turns all enemies on screen into gold coins for five seconds, Jack retains all previous powers. The manual refers to other secret powers that it doesn&#8217;t specifically mention.Torture RoomThe Torture Room is where Jack is sent when he gets too &#8220;greedy&#8221;, meaning when he holds more than 9 Mighty Coins. The Torture Room is a single-screen sized room where a set number of enemies spawn and there is no immediate escape. In order for Jack to escape the torture room he must avoid the enemies until the timer reaches zero (0). Once Jack escapes the torture room the stage timer will be reset back to sixty (60) and Jack&#8217;s Mighty Coins will be reset back to zero (0).EnemiesEnemies are the main threat in Mighty Bomb Jack and Jack is given very few ways of dispatching them. Any contact with an enemy will result in a loss of a life. Jack can eliminate an enemy by collecting a power ball which turns enemies into gold coins that can be collected thus eliminating the enemy. Jack can also turn enemies into gold coins by achieving third tier Mighty Power. Finally the easiest way to eliminate an enemy is by moving until they are off screen, once they are gone from screen they will disappear.Mummy &#8211; Mummies move left and right and can fall off the edge of a platform. They are the only enemies that spawn into the world, after a few seconds on screen they transform into one of the other enemy types.Spider &#8211; Spiders are slow moving and track Jack directly, they move in diagonal lines.Skull &#8211; Skulls are slow moving and move in Jack's direction, they move in diagonal lines and can only change direction after hitting the wall, ceiling or floor.Parrot &#8211; Parrots are slow moving and track Jack directly, they move on horizontal and vertical lines.Turtle Shell &#8211; Turtle Shells are the fastest enemy in the game, they track Jack and sprint directly to Jack&#8217;s position and move on all axes. After a sprint they usually follow up with a slower move towards Jack, allowing for escape.Fireball &#8211; Fireballs are slow moving, they track Jack directly and can move on all axes.Bat &#8211; Bats are slow moving and do not track Jack, they move in diagonal lines and can only change direction once they hit a wall, ceiling or floor.Items &amp; PickupsThere are various items found in world that serve to increase score and give additional benefits once collected. Items can also be hidden in secret blocks, jumping from one of these special blocks will result in the item becoming exposed. Most secret areas are accessed by finding these hidden items.Bombs &#8211; Bombs are the main collectible in the game and are placed throughout every level. (100 or 200 pts depending on lit fuse.)Treasure Chest &#8211; Treasure Chests are either red or orange, they contain pickups and other items that help Jack and increase the player's score. Orange chests require the player to have Mighty Power active.Treasure Bag &#8211; Treasure Bags are found in treasure Chests, the value of the Treasure Bag is indicated on the bag itself. (100, 300, or 1,000 pts.)Power Ball &#8211; Power Balls are a white ball with a red stripe and labeled with a &#8220;P&#8221;. There are a number of ways to get a Power Ball to appear. Power Balls appear in Royal Palace rooms automatically. They also appear if Jack collects enough bomb points, once achieved a chime will ring and the next Treasure Chest Jack opens will contain a Power Ball. Power Balls change all enemies on screen into gold coins.Mighty Drink &#8211; Mighty Drink is a red bottle with a white &#8220;M&#8221; in the center. Mighty Drink can be found in Treasure Chests and gives an additional 10 counts on the timer. (1,000 pts.)Sphinx &#8211; Sphinges open secret passages throughout the pyramid, typically Sphinges will be hidden in secret blocks. (10,000 pts.)Slave &#8211; Slaves are green in color and are pharaoh-like in appearance, they can be saved from the main rooms of the game for bonus points. (2,000 pts.)Balloon &#8211; Balloons are red and appear randomly from Treasure Chests. They immediately ascend and if collected before they disappear off the top of the screen Jack is awarded bonus points. (10,000 pts.)Gold Coin &#8211; Gold Coins are found in Treasure Chests and created from enemies. (500 pts.)Mighty Coin &#8211; Mighty Coins are found in Treasure Chests and look like Jack&#8217;s face on a gold coin. Mighty Coins give Jack super powers, however don&#8217;t collect to many at one time or Jack will be sent to the torture room. (1,000 pts.)Extra Coin &#8211; Extra Coins are red coins with a white &#8220;E&#8221; in the center, they provide Jack with an extra life. (3000 pts.)Secret Coin &#8211; Secret Coins are white coins with a red &#8220;S&#8221; in the center. Jack needs to collect 5 of these as well as the two Crystal Balls hidden in the pyramid to get the best ending. Secret Coins can only be picked up while in the final form of &#8220;Mighty Power&#8221;, the green tier. (50,000 pts.)Bonus Coin &#8211; Bonus Coins are white coins with a red &#8220;B&#8221; in the center. Bonus Coins only appear in the Royal Palace rooms and move about the room on the ground. They add a multiplier to the points collected in the Royal Palace room, which can be increased to a level 5 multiplier.Crystal Ball &#8211; There are two Crystal Balls hidden in the pyramid, both are required to save everyone in the royal family and receive the best ending.EndingsThere are multiple endings in Mighty Bomb Jack that are dependent on what conditions the player satisfies before entering the final series of rooms. The best ending requires the player to find both Crystal Balls and five (5) Secret Coins. This allows the player to save the entire royal family. [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Mini Golf</title_clean>
			<plot>Hole-In-One Miniature Golf provides an overhead view of each hole. The game play is controlled entirely with the mouse. You place the ball on the starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once you have placed the ball, "stretch" a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the distance between the pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left mouse button to putt the ball. You are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will get a penalty stroke and must advance to the next hole (or player). You can also get one stroke penalty for going into a water hazard. Your scorecard will be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime using the Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed again. You can print your scores or exit to continue. The game features five complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course which is patterned after the basic traditional miniature golf course, an Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, elevations and difficulty, an adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball and the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive. </plot>

			<plot>In Moon Blaster you are a pilot of a ground-skimming space jet landed on the surface of moons to eliminate the enemies blasting them off. There are three kinds of moon - sand, green and ice, and you may visit all or only one of them. Sitting in the cockpit, you may speed up or turn your space jet, and blast off the enemy. Keep an eye on the scanner to see which directions and distances have threats, and watch the shield level - one this reaches zero, a shot will force you to eject. Points are accumulated for shots fired and time survived.</plot>

			<plot>Moonfall is set on the moon Frontier Alfa which was once colonized by human settlers. Unfortunately they were enslaved by an alien race later. After even more time passes, the player arrives on this moon. He does not become a slave, however, but receives a trading license. The big goal of the game is to earn enough money to buy every base, factory, station and plant in order to free humanity.Similar to Elite, this is a mix between a trading and an action game. The player travels over the moon, visits the settlements and buys/sells one of the 18 different goods. Of course it is important to know where which product is needed in order to receive a good profit. This should not just be saved but also reinvested into weapon upgrades (additionally to the starting laser shot, homing missiles and mines) to survive space pirate attacks. The player may also choose to go into the pirate business and attack freighters. The ship has a high-speed travel motor to speed up the traveling time between settlements after choosing them on the navigation computer. There are also some missions to do.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Moon Patrol is an arcade game originally released in 1982 by Irem and later licensed for release in North America by Williams (Midway). It is a side-scrolling shooter that puts players at the controls of a six-wheeled moon rover that can jump and shoot. The goal is to move through the entire course as quickly as possible while shooting enemies for additional points. Cannons are mounted on the front and top of the vehicle, and both fire simultaneously when the fire button is pressed. Rocks, mines, and pits in the course prevent you from just holding to the right for maximum speed. Rocks and mines can be shot, but pits must be jumped. Some enemies fire shots that create new pits in the course, forcing players to react quickly.The course is broken up into multiple checkpoints, each denoted by a letter. Some checkpoints ("E," for example) cause the game to stop, check your time, award bonus points for fast movement, and send you on your way. When the end is reached, a further bonus is awarded and the player returns to the first checkpoint.As with many games of its era, Moon Patrol was ported around to several different home platforms.[CR]Television Reference[CR]On the popular T.V. show, Psych, the episode tuesday the 17th, you can hear a direct reference to Moon Patrol and actully see gameplay.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Moonshine Racers was released for the Atari ST, Amiga and PC in 1991 and puts the player behind the driving wheel of a pick-up truck carrying the eponymous homebrew liquor, moonshine. The player must transport it to Tucker's Bar, who will buy it at a premium, but must contend with the local law enforcement, Sheriff Fat Sam, as well as other traffic on the road.The player character is constantly listening to various talking heads talking through his radio: Ike, his informant and cousin; Sheriff Fat Sam, as he goes on patrol; Petuna, Fat Sam's radio operator; Tucker, his contact; and the two dogs Scraps (the player character's dog) and Rommel (the Sheriff's dog), who both speak English.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]While in most parts a standard racing game from the behind-the-car perspective popularized by games like OutRun, the game also incorporates elements from Chase H.Q. and other Arcade vehicular combat games. The player will take damage if they come into contact with other vehicles, including the tenacious Sheriff's police car, and must reach each checkpoint in their journey to Tucker's Bar before their engine overheats and explodes from collisions and obstacles on the road. The player can also collect additional barrels of moonshine for a larger bonus at the end of the course.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>You are Lemmy - the leader of the heavy metal band Mot&#246;rhead. Your fellow band members have been kidnapped by fans of other music genres. Our bass-guitar-wielding hero goes on a Double Dragon-esque journey in this side-scrolling beat 'em up. On each level Lemmy heads right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of enemies who pop up in hopes of beating him up. Throughout 6 levels, each of them representing a different genre, you'll not only beat up the enemies with your trusty instrument, but also use various powers - such as an incinerating belch or a deadly bass guitar solo. You'll need to collect powerups that come out of defeated enemies - some of them will heal you, some will give you the energy necessary to use for your powers. After each level (except for the last one) you play a short minigame. </plot>

You will have to jump over flowers, dodge bouncing balls, dinosaurs and dinosaurs amongst other things - contact with any of these loses a life. Movement is achieved along ledges, via clouds, moving platforms and up ladders. Short falls can be withstood, but larger ones (or heavy landings from jumps) are fatal. Once they have all been collected you must reach the door, doing all of this within the time limit, depicted by a picture of a diffusing bomb</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mr. Heli, sometimes Mr. Heli no Daibouken ("Mr. Heli's Great Adventure") or Battle Chopper, is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up from Irem. It originated in the Arcade in 1987 and in 1989 was ported to the PC Engine by Irem and to various Western home computers by Probe Entertainment and Firebird. The PC Engine version of the game was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008.Mr. Heli would make cameo playable appearances in the Game Boy game Shuyaku Sentai Irem Fighter as well as R-Type Final. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each stage, Mr. Heli makes his way through a horizontal level fighting enemies coming in from either direction. Mr. Heli can turn around, but cannot progress backwards through the level. At the end of each level is a boss encounter.As well as the standard forward-firing gun, Mr. Heli also has a missile which fires directly upwards and bombs which roll across the ground before exploding. With these two weapons, the player can destroy bricks above and below Mr. Heli to reveal gemstones, which add to the player's money total and power-up icons, which require the notified amount of money before they can be used. Power-ups will increase the strength of any of Mr. Heli's weapons, and can provide other benefits.  [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins with the protagonists "Max Force" and "Hit Man" receiving an urgent message from the chairman of Narcotics Operations, Spencer Williams. The duo have been given the task of neutralizing the threat of "Mr Big," the leader of a drug related terrorist organization. The operation is given the code name "Project NARC" and takes place over the course of eleven gore-filled levels.[CR][B]Basics:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is that of a basic side-scrolling shoot-'em-up. Players control Max Force or Hit Man, armed with either a machine gun or rocket launcher. Enemies include drug dealers, junkies and other criminals. Players collect extra ammunition and confiscate drugs and money from fallen foes to increase their score. Moral choices help determine the score at the end of each level. Players can kill everything in sight or try to arrest as many criminals as possible. At the end of each level, the game will award players for arresting as many criminals as possible without killing them.While the Porsche on the title screen is usually only seen as the player arrives at the level start and jumps out, one level changes gameplay by allowing the player to drive it. The Porsche has the same weapons as the player, and is also able to run over criminals. Arresting criminals is also possible while in the Porsche, but is difficult without running them over. Hazards for reckless driving come in the guise of land mines and dumpsters, which will destroy the Porsche and put the player back on foot. The player can also manually exit/enter the Porsche by jumping out/in.The main draw of the game was the gory violence. Using the rocket launcher would result in enemies' limbs scattering all over the screen and blood spewing through the air.[CR]Controversy[CR]The original arcade edition was released in 1988. As games became more graphically detailed, the good-intentioned crusade of Max Force and Hit Man became a easy target for concerned parents, what with the digitized blood and the heavy drug theme. The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Rare in 1990 with some significant changes. The absence of drugs was the most notable, however the ultra-violence and the dismemberment of junkies survived the port pretty much intact.[CR]Remake[CR]In 2005, the series was in the limelight once more when a remake for the Xbox, Playstation 2, and PC was released. The game received an M rating from the ESRB and was banned in Australia (possibly due to the characters' ability to consume drugs in order to boost their performance). The game was soon forgotten, being in the same genre as Grand Theft Auto, which was controversial in a much more high profile way, luring the the crowd of angry parents away from it. The remake featured the voice talents of Michael Madsen, Bill Bellamy, and Ron Perlman.[CR]</plot>

Your mission is to equip and position three squads of elite cops on the perimeter, and guide them through the enemy's network of tunnels. Once through you must level the factory with explosives.[CR]The loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.[CR]The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.</plot>

You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must destroy the missiles by placing bombs next to them and then fleeing the scene. [CR]You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on (neither of which fit with the film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic Ocean Film License #718).

			<plot>This racing game is set in the Ramsay Street universe of the Australian soap opera, which was hugely popular in the UK at the time. Nominally you play Scott Robinson, riding his skateboard in races against between one and four fellow characters  Mike Young on another skateboard, Charlene Ramsay in a go-kart, her brother Henry on a lawnmower, and Matt Robinson on a motorcycle. The eight races take in Ramsay Street, the Lassiters Complex, Erinsborough High School, and Ansons Corner. There are three boards available (two on the Spectrum), trading top speed off against manoeuvrability.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] involves guiding your craft through a series of gates around a forced-perspective course. There are three levels of hazard presence available  hazards include kangaroos, emus and other (stereotypically Australian) animals, Bouncer the dog, grotty old Mrs. Mangel, and traffic bollards. Contact with any of these costs you time, and popularity (reflected by a Neighbours logo fading out along the bottom of the screen  collecting litter will restore this).</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The New Zealand Story, sometimes stylized as The NewZealand Story and occasionally called Kiwi Kraze, is a 1988 Arcade action game from Taito that was ported to a number of platforms. The player controls the kiwi bird Tiki and must rescue his fellow kiwis, including his girlfriend Phee-Phee, from the villainous Willy Walrus. Kiwis can be found at the end of each stage, which the player must progress through with a mix of platforming, vehicle sequences and shooting enemies with bolts to remove them.The computer ports were published by UK company Ocean Software, which also published the NES game in Europe. The North American NES release was named Kiwi Kraze instead. It also saw a Japan-exclusive PC Engine port that would later be added to the Wii's Virtual Console (also Japan only). The Arcade version of The New Zealand Story was also added to the 2005 Taito Legends compilation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of The New Zealand Story takes place in the Zoological Garden of New Zealand's North Island. The two kiwis Tiki and his girlfriend Phee-Phee live happily together with the rest of the colony, until one day Wally Walrus comes to town. Wally captures the defenseless kiwis and carries them off to cages hidden in zoos and parks all over New Zealand. Trapped, they can only await their fate of being eaten by the Walrus!Luckily, while Wally is busy thinking about kiwi meals, Tiki manages to escape from his cage and plans to save his girlfriend Phee-Phee and the rest of the colony. A race against time begins as Tiki battles with Wally's friends in the maze-like worlds of New Zealand's zoos, so that he can finally reach the evil Walrus and save his friends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lives, Continues and ScoringTiki starts the game with three lives. He can get a bonus life at 50,000 points and every additional 20,000 points after that. Tiki loses a life when he is hit or when he runs out of oxygen. The player does not have to start the level from the beginning, though. They can resume the game directly where Tiki died. At the beginning of the game the player does not have any continues, but after completing stage 2-4 and 4-5 they are awarded a continue.Each time Tiki destroys an enemy the player gains 150 points. Additionally, enemies drop bonuses after being defeated. The bonus items are worth 100 extra points and in some cases Tiki also gets a special power from them.Bonus items include:Fruit: These only give 100 extra pointsWeapons: Bow and Arrow, Bomb, Laser Gun, Plasma Ball.Joystick: This one is only useful for riding balloons. It allows the player to control the balloon in a more sophisticated way than they normally can. It allows Tiki to stay in mid-air (normally the only options are to go either up or down) and change the direction left, right, up and down.Book: The book immediately destroys all enemies on-screen.Potion: The potion grants Tiki temporal invincibility.Stopwatch: All enemies are immobilized for a limited amount of time.MovementTiki has four basic abilities: he can shoot his bow, walk, jump and swim.Jumping can be alternated in height by holding down the button longer or shorter.When swimming, Tiki only has a limited supply of oxygen. He can attack enemies from the water when coming up for air by squirting water at them.Tiki is furthermore able to fly with the help of balloons. Balloons can be found scattered around the levels or he can steal them from enemies. There are six different kinds of balloons in total. Each of them has different characteristics.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 21 levels in total. All the levels are set in real life locations in New Zealand.The game begins in Auckland, then passes through Rotorua, The Waitomo Caves, Wellington Strait, Cook Strait and Hammer Springs to the final confrontation with Wally at Mount Cook. In every level Tiki has to save one of his kiwi friends, until he finally reaches his girlfriend Phee-Phee. The enemies, however, are not the only problem: There is a time limit for every level. If the player is too slow the Time Dragon will descend.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Evil sorceress Zoldrane casted an evil spell upon your Grandfather. As Nicky, you must find a way to defeat Zoldrane, and to get an elixir from her chest that will cure Grandfather.[CR]During the travels, Nicky is able to move around the levels, jump over obstacles, and duck to avoid flying threats. Nicky must collect gems, flying bombs, dynamite, keys, and other specific objects. These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break the walls to find the secret areas. [CR]Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way. As you do all this, a score is calculated, and then listed in the high score table. Passwords are offered to allow you to resume from a previously-reached level.</plot>

			<plot>The sequel to Nicky Boom; this time Nicky must find out who has been removing ladders and blocking off caves in his homeland. The gameplay is essentially platform, with multi-directional maze-like levels. Beating the obstructions requires occasional brainwork  hidden ladders are easy enough to uncover, and there are lots of hidden sections to look for. The levels are colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players.  Mirrors are placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.</plot>

			<title_clean>Night Breed</title_clean>
			<plot>This is the first of a planned trilogy of games based on Clive Barker's movie Nightbreed (the second game was Nightbreed: The Interactive Movie, and the third game was never released).  This is a side-scrolling action game where Boone must fight his way through Midian, fighting the Sons of the Free and the Berserkers.There are five legs to Boone's quest as listed in the manual:1)  Collect the 3 keys to Midian; one is located on each level.  In order to obtain the 3rd key, you must defeat the MASK (although he will subsequently escape).2)  Work your way around the Necropolis and down through Midian to the Nightbreeds' God, BAPHOMET, who will then baptize you.  This will enable you to transform into CABAL for short periods of time.  CABAL can withstand attack better than BOONE and has greater strength than his alter ego.3)  Open the door to the BERSERKERS chamber.4)  Work your way up to the surface of Midian to free the Breed.  They then tell you that the MASK has your girlfriend, LORI.5)  Descend back down and engage in the ultimate battle with the MASK.  With victory achieved, you must get back to the surface of Midian where you will be re-united with LORI.</plot>

			<title_clean>Night Shift</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Night Shift is a 2D platformer with a strategic element in which the player, as either Fred or Fiona Fixit, has to maintain and properly configure an enormous factory production machine named the BEAST. The BEAST needs to meet a quota of toys based on Star Wars and Indiana Jones and can only produce them if all its components are in working order.As well as performing fixes and switching levers so that all the conveyor belts are moving in the correct direction, the player character also has to jump on a stationary bike to recharge the system's battery power.The game was the fledgling product of UK game developer Attention to Detail. LucasFilm took the team under their wing, adding the LucasFilm tie-in and expanding the scope of the game. Prior to their involvement, the game was to be called Fixit. It was released for various 8-bit and 16-bit home computer systems active in Europe in 1990.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level of Night Shift is a shift of work at the same factory. Because of this, the playing field never changed. Rather, in the early levels, most of the factory parts that the player will eventually have to maintain and manage function automatically without needing any work. They're also kept behind plexiglass initially, so the player wouldn't be overwhelmed by the BEAST's multiple functions. As the game progresses, more parts of the machine are unlocked which adds to the player's responsibilities and the game's difficulty.Not only does the player have to mange a huge number of tasks, they also have to maneuver a level of conveyor belts and platforms to get to them. The player cannot see the whole level at once and the tools needed are single use. This includes the wrench and matches which are used to keep some parts of the machine operational. If they run out, the player has no chance of winning. The game had zero margin of error in later shifts. Each delivered toy has to be made perfectly (and being the end product of many processes, this was hard) and if the player didn't meet the quota, the game ended.B.E.A.S.T.The machine Fred and Fiona work in. It is made of many parts and comprises the entire playing field.Battery - Powered by riding a bicycle. Two light bulbs indicate how well the battery is charged by the speed at which they flash. Charging the battery is the first step of every shift. It must be repeated periodically throughout the shift as well. If the battery ever goes fully dead, the furnace goes out too and has to be lit.Furnace - Must be kept lit or most devices in the factory won't have power.Raw Material Feeder - Plug must be in and conveyor belt moving in correct direction.Solidifier Supplier - Must be kept plugged in and and at the right temperature. The temperature isn't set with a discrete controller, rather the mixture is heated and cooled and then is set to maintain that temperature.Expander Supplier - Balloons attached indicate pressure levels. Liquid Concentrate Supplier - Must be controlled with wheel and lever to keep flow of concentrate steady.Resin Maker - Has bolts that come loose and have to be tightened.Doll Molds - Both head and body molds are set independently. If they do not both come from the same toy, the doll produced won't count.Head Punch - After a set number of parts are produced, a boxing glove will punch the mold out and queue up the next mold. This must be kept plugged in and the counter set correctly.Paint Shop - The paint must be mixed to the correct color. There are three base paints (red, blue, yellow) used to mix several additional colors (like green and brown). The fan must be plugged in or the paint won't dry.Bonding Unit - Glues doll parts together. If the parts don't match, it is sometimes possible to shuffle the order they enter the machine to ensure a match.Quality Controller - Is not controlled by the player, automatically rejects incorrectly made dolls. Dolls have to be made from one head on top of one body and must follow the design on the quota.Stock Checker - Counts the number of dolls made correctly against the daily quota. A correctly made doll still has to be the right type and painted correctly or it won't count towards the quota. Once the goal has been, extra proper dolls of any kind will raise the player's earnings.Packaging - Each properly made doll must be placed in a crate after it has passed the stock checker.ToolsAll tools are single use but the player character can hold multiples and they carry over between shifts.Wrench - Used to tighten bolts.Match Stick - Used to light flames.Helium Balloon - Allows the protagonist to rise quickly in the machine.Umbrella - Allows the protagonist to fall quickly in the machine.Vacuum Cleaner - Used to suck up Lemmings.Venus Trap - Eats Lemmings.BonusesHourglass - Extends the shift timer.Cash Bonus - Raises the score.EnemiesLemming - A male named Cliff who tampers with equipment and a female named Jodee who will latch onto the player character, slowing them down. They can be kicked, vacuumed, or fed to the Venus Trap.Playable CharactersBoth play the same, but one is a woman and one a man.Fred FixitFiona FixitReferencesThe dolls that can be manufactured all feature in other LucasArts games (mostly being characters from George Lucas movies).Darth VaderC-3POR2D2Luke SkywalkerStormtrooper (called "Trooper Toddlers" in the manual)Indiana JonesManualThe manual was written as though it really was the maintenance manual for the machine being operated. Complete with torn pages, scrawled notes, and coffee stains. It was also made to look as if it was typed on a typewriter missing an 'e'.Copy ProtectionLike many games of that era, Night Shift came with a code wheel. The player matched the heads and bodies of characters from LucasArts games to get four fruits the player needs to enter as a security clearance before playing.Recycling ThemeAlthough it does not come up in the game, the manual has a very strong recycling theme with all the materials being recycled from something else.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Ninja Rabbits</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ninja Rabbits is a beat 'em up developed and published by Micro Value for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS platforms in the UK in 1991. Ninja Rabbits was followed by a sequel titled International Ninja Rabbits which was a very similar game to the original, but with updated graphics.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Ninja Rabbits the player travels from the left of the screen to the right, fighting enemies and dodging projectiles. Ninja Rabbits can be controlled using either the keyboard or a joystick. There are three different difficulty levels to choose from in Ninja Rabbits: Easy, Medium, and Hard.The player has a staff weapon that can be used as a melee attack against the enemies. The staff is used when the player presses the attack button while standing still. A kick attack can also be used by pressing forward and attacking. There is also the ability to jump by pressing up, however the jump is very small.HealthCarrot Health MeterThe players health meter is represented by a carrot. When damage is taken an amount of the carrot will disappear, starting from the left and working to the right. When the health meter is completely depleted, one of the lives is lost.LivesLives LeftIn Ninja Rabbits a player has three lives to start with. The lives left are represented by rabbit heads. Once a player loses a life, one of the rabbit heads will disappear and the player will start again from the beginning of the current screen. Once a player has lost all three lives a game over will happen.Power-UpsPower-Up BlockThere are falling question mark blocks with wings that will fall from the top of the screen. These blocks will contain various power-ups such as: points, health, lives, or a shield that allows the player to take more hits before losing a life.ScoreThe ScoreNinja Rabbits features high scores. A player will receive points for various activities in the game such as defeating an enemy or getting a point power-up. The score is represented by a six digit number at the top of the screen.[CR]Version Differences[CR]There are some differences between the games on the various platforms. The biggest change is the layout of the hud, which is different in the DOS version than it is in the other versions. The levels are also in different orders in some of the versions.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ninja Spirit is an action game originally developed and published by Irem Corporation. It was released in the Arcades and was ported to various European home computers (which were published by Activision), the Game Boy and the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. The TG16 version was eventually ported to the Wii's Virtual Console.The player takes on the role of Tsukikage (Moon Shadow), the canine companion of a slain ninja. The dog takes on his master's form to avenge him by taking on an army of demonic ninja.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can press the select button at any time to switch between one of four weapons (the Righteous Cloud [katana], Swirling Leaf [shuriken], Bamboo Thunder [explosives], and Kusarigama [chain-scythe]). Each weapon can be aimed using the direction pad to attack forward, up, diagonally, and downward, and they can be powered up by collecting red orbs dropped by bright red ninja.In addition, the hero can multiply by collecting blue orbs dropped by the bright red ninja enemies. Up to two shadow ninja can appear at once, which copy the protagonist's every movement and attack, tripling his attack power. A pinkish orb kills all enemies on screen for a couple of seconds.The PC-Engine version port is the closest to its arcade counterpart and allows infinite continues as well as two difficulty settings: one where the player has 5 hit points, and another more difficult mode taken directly from the Arcade version where the protagonist is killed in one hit. Certain enemies still kill the hero in one hit regardless of which mode is played.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>The Ninja Warriors</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Ninja Warriors is a brawler of the Rush'n Attack model - the goal is to walk forward and take care of any enemies that approach from the front and rear. The protagonist, one of two robotic ninja, is fairly durable but not invincible: as they take damage their synthetic flesh falls away to reveal the robot underneath. The goal of the game is to track down the corrupt American President Banglar and assassinate him, thus lifting the oppressive martial law he has declared to keep the population in check.The Ninja Warriors was originally an Arcade game. It was later ported to many home computers in the West and on the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-16 in Japan only. A heavily revised version developed by Natsume and named simply Ninja Warriors ("The Ninja Warriors Again" in Japan and "Ninja Warriors: The New Generation" in Europe) would later be released for the SNES in 1994.[CR]Development[CR]The arcade version of The Ninja Warriors was developed and published by Taito Corporation in 1987. For the 1986 game, Darius, Taito Corporation had developed a method of creating the effect of a "triple-wide" screen by placing two other screens inside the cabinet and using mirrors create the illusion of three contiguous screens. The Ninja Warriors used the same method to create a large, widescreen display.The music for the game was produced by Taito's in-house band, Zuntata, and written by Hisayoshi Ogura. Pony Canyon and Scitron released the two soundtracks for the game in 1988 and 1991, while further arrangements were released in 1993 and by Zuntata Records and Taito in 1988 and 2009. The track from the first level, Daddy Mulk, would receive limited acclaim, and was sampled by Australian rock band Lucius Hunt in the track "This Haunting (2006)". An option available in some console versions of the game allowed players to watch a "Prologue" to the game, which featured Zuntata including themselves into plot. The poorly translated English narration claims that the terrorist hero finds his dead friend at the bar with the initials ZTT on his back. The hero finds a nightclub with a neon sign that reads ZTT and watches Zuntata perform. After hearing Zuntata, the terrorist is inspired to create the two ninja robots that kill the President, thus beginning the game.The Ninja Warriors uses a 8-way Joystick and two buttons which correspond to dagger and ninja star. The game allowed for two player simultaneous play, with the players controlling either a blue male ninja or red female ninja.Despite the title screen of The Ninja Warriors saying 1987, the arcade cabinet was released in February, 1988. Distribution of the game in the United States was licensed to Romstar.Taito would supervise ports of the game to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16), Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64, relatively quickly after the release of the arcade version. Because none of the console versions could support the "triple-wide" screen from the arcade game, many of the visuals majorly decreased in quality. Aisystem Tokyo would develop the Mega CD version of the game, which would be released in 1993. Both the PC Engine and Mega CD version would feature plot text over the introduction. The Mega CD version was described by Mega as "very poor by any standards." However, the Mega CD version featured the best graphics, allowed the player to continue where they left off when they died, and additional difficulty settings, all of which is absent from other ports. All of the console versions would be published solely in Japan.[CR]Taito Ninja Warriors Arcade System[CR]Arcade system board: Taito Ninja Warriors (ref)CPU (ref) Main CPU: 2&#215; Motorola 68000 @ 8 MHzSound CPU: ZilogZ80 @ 4 MHzSound chips (ref) Yamaha YM2610 @ 8 MHz Channels: 4 FM channels, 3 SSG channels, 7 ADPCM channelsADPCM: 6 channels @ 18.5 kHz (12-bit), 1 channel @ 1.85&#8211;55.5 kHz (16-bit)Yamaha YM3016F: Stereo audio DACTaito TC006DCA: Custom ceramic DAC/filter moduleTaito TC0140SYT: Custom sound control ICGPU chipset (ref) 3&#215; Taito TC0070RGB RGB/Video Mixer (1 per screen)3&#215; Taito TC0110PCR Palette Generator (1 per screen)3&#215; Taito TC0100SCN Tilemap Generator (1 per screen)Display (ref) (ref) Monitors: 3-monitor setupResolution: 864&#215;224 pixels (288&#215;224 per screen)Scanlines: 256Refresh rate: 60 Hz (60 frames per second)Colors displayed: 12,288 overall, 4096 (12-bit) per screenColor palette: 98,304 overall, 32,768 (15-bit) per screenSprite planeSprite size: 16&#215;16 pixelsColors per sprite: 16 colors (4-bit)Sprites on screen: 128 sprites on screen, 16 KB (16,384 Bytes) sprite RAM, 128 Bytes per spriteSprite texels: 26.686 MHz, 26.686 million texels per second (60 frames per second), 444,766 texels per frame (256 scanlines), 1737 texels per scanlineSprites per scanline: 108Tilemap planes per screen: 3 (9 total) Scrolling background layer: 128&#215;64 (8192) tiles, 8&#215;8 pixels per tileScrolling foreground layer: 128&#215;64 (8192) tiles, 8&#215;8 pixels per tileText layer: 128&#215;32 (4096) charactersHardware capabilities: 2D, scrolling, parallax scrolling, line scrolling[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]In the March 1988 issue of British magazine Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley gave the original arcade version a positive review.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nitro is a topdown racer that up to 3 people can play together against a computer opponent using a combination of joysticks and keyboard. There are 32 levels to complete.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Instead of races being timed like most racing games, players race until their gas runs out. At the start of the game, players are given 2000 gas points. As the player drives, the gas points decrease. If the player's gas points reach zero, the game ends.Players choose the character they'd like to play and the type of vehicle although neither seem to bear any difference in the races. A 3 character name is chosen at this stage to identify the player. The game doesn't conform to standard barriers and many shortcuts can be found. Various hazards appear on the road that will slow you down if not avoided.In between races players have a chance to upgrade their vehicles in the shop. Player's earn cash for winning races and can pick up random money that floats by on the track.One interesting gameplay element is displayed during the night levels where the entire level is black save for a circle of light emitted by the vehicle's headlights. These tracks prove the most challenging since there are shortcuts and the player can easily get turned around without realizing it.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The music should be mentioned as it was very good for it's time. Chunky synthesized guitars and drum beats keep the pace of the race going strong.[CR]Specifics[CR]VehiclesRace Car Sports Car Buggie Tracks sectionsCity Forest Desert Apocalyptic Landscape CharactersCyborg Clint Eastwood Cyborg Sylvester Stalone Cyborg Arnold Schwarzenegger UpgradesGas (price 1) Nitro Boost Fix Damage (price 1) Hi Speed (price 4) Accelerate (price 3) Traction (price 2) HazardsRed pylons (stop car for a second) Red patches (slow car down) Blue patches (spin out of control) In Race ItemsCash Gas Nitros [CR]Credits[CR]Coding and Design: Jamie WoodhouseSupport Code: Phil BettsMaps: Jaimie WoodhouseAdditional Maps: Chris StanleyMusic &amp; FX: Sound ImagesProduction: Steve Riding[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>North &amp; South</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]North &amp; South is a 1989 turn-based strategy-sim game about the American Civil War and an offshoot of the Belgian comic Les Tuniques Bleues. It was developed by the French video game company Infogrames (now Atari SA) and released on a number of home computers, as well as the NES.One or more players picks a side and tries to win the American Civil War. At the beginning of a game of North &amp; South the player can choose the starting year of the game (which determines how the two sides are doing), the AI difficulty of the factions, and whether or not the player wants three simulation options: weather (which can prevent armies from moving), intervention by the British or occasional attacks by the Native Americans and Mexicans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The gameplay of North &amp; South happens in three phases:The Strategic PhaseThe player begins the game looking at a map of the United States with a handful of starting territories occupied by the Union and a handful by the Confederacy. The player movse their armies across the map to take control of territory and engage the enemy. Although all territory counts towards the player's reinforcements, the most important areas to take are railway stations. The more railway stations a player controls, the more maximum reinforcements they can receive at the end of their turn. A player cannot get reinforcements without having at least two connected railway stations. The Battle PhaseWhen two armies engage on the strategic map, a real-time battle ensues where the two forces are arranged on opposite sides of one of several battle maps. A normal army includes the following soldier types:Infantrymen: An army begins with a group of six infantrymen. They attack by shooting forward a small distance, but need to get out of formation when moving. This can cause them to be slow to deal with the faster cavalry, but unlike cavalry are able to retreat.Cavalry: An army begins with a group of three cavalrymen. They are very fast, but once they start moving towards the opposite side of the map they cannot reverse direction until they reach the opposite side. They attack at close range by swinging their cavalry swords. They have to rely on avoiding the gunfire of the infantry and artillery to get close enough to eliminate them.Artillery: An army begins with a single artillery cannon. The artillery cannon can move vertically on the tactical map to avoid getting hit, but it cannot advance. The artillery piece attacks by firing a cannon shot. The player determines how far the shot goes by using a power gauge. The artillery is the only unit in the game with variable shot range and has by far the longest attack range. The artillery automatically retreats from battle if it runs out of ammunition.The battle ends when one of the forces is annihilated. The maps that the game provides have significant differences, but most of the maps revolve around control of two bridges that bridge a divide between the two armies. These bridges can be damaged by artillery fire. Control of these points leads to victory. Some items on the map, such as houses and often bridges can be damaged or destroyed by artillery fire. Combining two armies on the strategic map results in a single army able to enter this phase with twice as many troops.The Attack PhaseThere are two ways to conquer an enemy railway station in North &amp; South. The first way is to conquer all of the surrounding territories, in which case the railway area automatically switches control to the conquering player. The other way is a head-on attack with an infiltrator. When a player attacks a railway station with one of their armies, the attack phase begins.In the attack phase, the attacking player controls a single man from a two-dimensional side-scrolling perspective. He must run across a fort area guarded by explosives, attack dogs and soldiers from the opposing player before the time limit runs out. The attacking invader can be hit unlimited times, but every time he is hit, he is momentarily stunned, losing time. The opposing player loses a man every time he is hit by the attacking player and will not be able to respawn his avatar if he is defeated a set number of times during the sequence. The invader starts the sequence with a handful of throwing knives, which he can use to attack the defending player's soldiers. The defending player also has knives, but they respawn every time their soldiers respawn. If the invader reaches the end of the fort, the railway station becomes theirs on the strategic map. There is also a very similar sequence that begins if one of a player's armies intercepts one of the enemy's trains during their travel. In that case the player must move their avatar across a moving train while the defending player is trying to knock them off it. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Jeffrey Archer: Not a Penny More, not a Penny Less - The Computer Game is an interactive fiction game based on Jeffrey Archer's novel Not a Penny More, not a Penny Less. The plot evolves around three Englishmen and one American who are swindled out of their savings. Now the four (the player takes the role of Stephen Bradley) try to swindle their money back from the original fraudster.The game closely follows the plot of the book with a few puzzles thrown in. In comparison to other adventures the player generally can't use directional commands to change location; all puzzles have to be solved in a location before he is allowed to leave it. However, it is still possible to miss important objects and reach a dead end later. The game also gives no clues about the goals of a screen and expects the player to have read the book first (included with the game).The puzzles are solved by typing in English commands, but the game only accepts precise commands.  A speciality is the digitized speech (the amount depends on the platform) where Bradley comments on certain game situations.</plot>

			<plot>Wil Mason has been transported to the fantasy world of Middlemere, which is ruled by four rival brothers. Wils aim is to find the secret to how he was transported here and discover a way back.[CR]The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.[CR]The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</plot>

			<plot>  [CR]Premise[CR] Drak, the last of the elite genetically enhanced super soldiers known as "Obliterators" has been sent on a suicide mission to stop an invincible ship full of hellish aliens from destroying the Federation's homeworld: Earth. To do this, the player must navigate Drak throughout the ship using his weapons and natural mobility.     Drak  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists mostly of moving Drak around the ship via transporters and elevators in search of the four symbols that will allow you to destroy the alien ship and escape. Drak can jump, take cover, and make diving rolls to avoid enemies and obstacles. Enemies will remain stationary until Drak enters their immediate area, but they will fire projectiles that must be avoided regardless of Drak's location or proximity. Enemies respawn and mostly serve as stationary obstacles while their projectiles are being avoided. Drak has four weapons that must be used throughout the exploration of the ship, as stronger enemies will only take damage from his more powerful weapons.    Taking damage.  Ammunition for Drak's weapons is not unlimited. Luckily more can be found scattered throughout the game. This encourages thurough exploration in the maze-like alien ship. Also, the players score is used creatively as the alien ship's self destruct countdown timer- making points serve a practical purpose.   [CR] Reception[CR] For it's initial release in 1989, Obliterator received mostly positive reviews. It's impressive graphics (Amiga version) and polished execution earned it a wide release on several platforms and a following of fans.   Criticisms were aimed mostly at it's easy difficulty and sometimes sticky controls.  [CR]The Never Released Commodore 64 Version [CR] While never released, a version of Obliterator was near finished for the Commodore 64. Developed by the now defunct  Lothlorien team, the project was canceled as the studio neared closure. Despite the official cancellation and being layed off, several former employees continued to work on the project from home without pay.    From the unreleased Comodore 64 version.

			<plot>Oids may be described as a cross between the classic arcade games Gravitar and Choplifter including a game editor for creating your own planetoids and galaxies.[CR]You control a V-Wing fighter on many different planetoids to rescue and free a race of android slaves, the "Oids" of the game's title. The spacecraft controls are similar to a lunar-lander. Turn and thrust because gravity is always pulling at your ship. If your ship crashes into a mountain or any other obstruction on the ground, it will explode.[CR]To survive against the various defenses on the planetoids (enemy spaceships, rockets and more) your ship is equipped with two different weapons and an energy shield. Flying around and using the energy shield costs fuel. You can refuel by landing next to a fuel base.[CR]The main objective on each of your missions is to rescue all the Oids on each planetoid in the galaxy. To rescue the Oids, you must first destroy the factories in which they are held captive. Use only single shoots to avoid killing the Oids. Once you have blasted a factory open, the Oids will run out and wave to you. Find a flat surface nearby and land your ship. Once eight Oids have climbed aboard, or you have rescued all the Oids on the planetoid, it's time to dock with your mother-ship to complete your rescue mission.</plot>

			<plot>Omega is a new direction in game design. The plot is innocent enough: futuristic tanks battling. There is a twist, however: the tanks are controlled by computers. It's your job, as the player, not to control the tanks in real time, but to learn a programming language designed for the game to build an artificial intelligence that will allow the tank to survive. Omega includes a massive manual that needs to be read before tackling the game.</plot>

			<title_clean>On the Road</title_clean>
			<plot>On the Road is a managerial simulation in which six players (either human or AI) become the manager of a forwarding agency. The basic goal is to generate as much profit as possible; the specific winning conditions can be set before starting the game. There are also other options, the most significant being if the police controls speed, weight and the night driving ban in Austria.Gameplay is completely menu based with a graphical representation of the office, this means clicking on the telephone brings up the telephone menu and so on. There are a big variety of things to take care of, e.g. insurance, employment, buying or selling trucks, managing the assignments, watching the financial status or expanding into other European cities. Other options present themselves in the city: a bank for making loans and paying bills, the court and lawyer agency for dealing with (or starting) law suits, an airport to fly to other cities and a company specialised on illegal deeds.A speciality compared to other managerial simulations with this scenario is that the player has to communicate with the drivers over a radio to give specific orders. Also the player has to take periods of rest to prevent health problems. Choosing reasonable rest times is an important aspect of the game because the competition has free game during those periods. During the resting times the player sees a map of Europe and what happens to the own drivers - for emergencies, the game can be re-entered prematurely to the next full hour, of course with negative health consequences.</plot>

			<title_clean>Onslaught</title_clean>
			<plot>Onslaught is split into two main modes: Initially, the player selects a territory based on its relative difficulty and influence. Then, as the high-powered "Fanatic" warrior, must fight their way through hordes of enemies in an action-platformer mode to reach the master of the castle. This master must be fought in a "mind battle": He'll be represented as a head with four wavy arms that fires magic at the player, who must dodge fighting back in a Tempest-style shoot-em-up battle. Should the player win, the territory is now theirs and they are able to select the next territory to conquer.Onslaught is notable for its moody sound track (a hallmark of Amiga games) by Dutch video game music composers Maniacs of Noise. It's also notoriously difficult, like many games of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]James Bond: The Stealth Affair, or as it is more commonly know in Europe, Operation Stealth is a point and click adventure game developed by French developer Delphine Software. It is the spiritual follow up to Future Wars (Les voyageurs du temps: la menace) using the same user interface and controls.On the Amiga the game is most notable for having spoken lines in places using synthesized speech. This is only available if you have more than 1MB of RAM.There is also some confusion regarding the name, as noted above. The game was released in the U.S. under the name James Bond: The Stealth Affair however it was not possible to get the James Bond license in Europe and was then renamed Operation Stealth. However it is probable assume that the game wasn&#8217;t initially intended to be released as a James Bond game since the storyline features many contradictions to the James Bond character (for instance, being employed by CIA).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game begins in Washington where James Bond (John Glames in the European version) arrives at the CIA Headquarters. He is told that an ultra-modern aircraft has been stolen and may have been landed in Santa Paragua. Glames catches a flight to Santa Paragua and begins his search for the missing aircraft.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Operation Wolf</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Operation Wolf is a light-gun game originally for the Arcade and later ported to a large number of home computers and consoles. The Arcade version was added to the 2005 PS2 Taito Legends compilation, though without light-gun support. The NES version was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008 in North America.Operation Wolf is one of the most recognizable faces in the "on-rails shooter" genre, and one of the earliest to be released. The player is a Special Forces Operative sent on a mission to rescue valuable POWs from concentration camps, moving from each area to the next.As the screen scrolls slowly to the right, various enemies run onto the screen at different distances to the player. The player has a short window to quickly shoot them before they take damage from the enemy's gunfire. Some enemies require multiple shots, while others are immune to bullets everywhere but their weak points. The player also has a finite number of grenades which they can use as a last resort.Operation Wolf was followed by three sequels: Operation Thunderbolt, Operation Wolf 3 and Operation Tiger.[CR]Missions / Levels[CR]Communications CenterJungleVillagePower Magazine/Ammunition DumpPrison/Concentration CampAirport[CR]Points[CR]Enemy / TaskPoints AttainedField soldier50 - 100Motorcycle soldier150Armored soldier200Guerrilla soldier200Knife soldier300Armored car1000Gun boat1000Helicopter2000General (soldier)5000Helicopter7000Completed Mission10000Completed Game (0 Prisoners Saved)60000Completed Game (1 Prisoner Saved)70000Completed Game (2 Prisoners Saved)80000Completed Game (3 Prisoners Saved)90000Completed Game (4 Prisoners Saved)100000Completed Game (5 Prisoners Saved)110000[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Copy protection (Amiga)This game was published in 1990 by MicroStyle, a Microprose arcade label, for the 8 bit homecomputers Amstrad CPC/ZX Spectrum and for the 16 bit homecomputers Amiga/Atari ST.A manual based in-game copy protection is included in some versions, so before the gameplay can start a specified word from the manual has to be entered properly.Oriental Games is the martial arts equivalent of the Olympics, a tournament in which the world's greatest fighters compete in a four-discipline contest (on the 16-bit machines Amiga and Atari ST there are only three disciplines available) in their attempt to become Grand Master. In mini-tournaments of Kendo, Kung Fu, Kyo-Kushin-Kai(Karate) and Sumo(only available in Amstard CPC and ZX Spectrum versions) the martial artists can win, like at the Olympics, gold, silver and bronze medals. In addition "merit awards" can be won by the fighters in the 16-bit versions of the game. Merit awards are gained for winning, winning by large margin, and for having a good hit/miss ratio. So the merit awards system gives an extra incentive to perform well rather than simply to win.Gameplay[CR]16-bit versions (Amiga/Atari ST):Game options screen (Amiga)On Amiga/Atari ST the play begins with the coach entering the reception area of the dojo(fighting school). An official, sitting behind the registration desk will ask for information regarding the competitors, and the type and level of competition they wish to enter. This information is given to the official via the "Game Options" screen where he following five game features may be altered:Game difficulty: Novice, Professional or Master.Game type: Either compete in the championship tournament with fifteen other competitors or to fight a head-to-head two competitor(Player vs. Player / Player vs. CPU) match.Human players: Up to 16 human players can join the championship tournament and up to 2 human players a head-to-head fight. The fighters are controlled by joysticks.Joystick editor: This feature is only available in the 16-bit Amiga/Atari ST versions. If not skipped the pre-programmed moves for the three events can be changed before each tournament starts. All the sixteen joystick positions(eight with fire pressed, and eight without) can be programmed with sequences of up to four moves. A fighter can, for example, deliver a jump kick to his opponent's head, perform a forward flip tourn round and deliver a roundhouse kick to his back all with one joystick move.Computer V Computer: Here the player can set if he wants to watch computer controlled fights or if he wants to skip them.Fighting display (Atari ST)After the registration process names of the human players can be entered and one gets to the dojo screen again where one of the there events(Kendo, Kung-Fu, Kyo-Kushin-Kai) displayed by the icons can be selected. Then a draw for the chosen event will be shown and the names of the competitors. Finally the "Fighting Display" showing the arena with the two fighters facing each other will be displayed and the action can start. At the top of the screen the names of the two opponents are shown and the mood(ranging from reckless to defensive) of the computer controlled fighter. The two flags at the top corners of the screen represent the stamina levels of the fighters. As the opponents perform their moves their stamina decreases and the flags move down the pole. So if stamina is low certain moves which require a lot of energy may fail during execution. But stamina increases when the fighters avoid making attaking moves for a while. The row of five lights, which are all green at the start of a bout, represents the scoring system of the game. The first hit a fighter receives from his opponent will turn a light white, the second hit will turn the light orange and the third one will turn the light red. When all five lights turn red(a total of 15 hits received from the opponent) the fighter has lost the bout. The moves that can be performed in each event are listed below.Fight report (Atari ST)A "fight report" is shown after each bout where details of a fight, like hits on opponent or merit awards, are listed. After the "fight report" the "games report" is updated and shown. The "games report" is a kind of ranking list showing overall won medals and merit awards by the fighters taking part in the tournament.The events:EventMoves (How to execute) High Block (Up)Head Block (UpForward)Shuffle Forward (Forward)Body Block (DownForward)Side Step (Down)Shuffle Back (Back)Jump Back (UpBack)Cleaver (Fire+Up)Headswing (Fire+UpForward)Bodyswing (Fire+Forward)Hipswing (Fire+DownForward)Stomach Jab (Fire+Down)Cleaver Feign (Fire+DownBack)Body Feign (Fire+Back)Head Feign (Fire+UpBack)  Jump (Up)Forward Flip (UpForward)Walk Forwards (Forward)Stomack Block (DownForward)Duck (Down)Inward Block (DownBack)Walk Back (Back)Back Flip (UpBack)Jump Kick (Fire+Up)Chin Punch (Fire+UpForward)Headbut (Fire+Forward)Reverse Punch (Fire+DownForward)Duck &amp; Punch (Fire+Down)Leg Stomp (Fire+DownBack)Turn Around (Fire+Back)Roundhouse Kick (Fire+UpBack) Jump (Up)Forward Flip (UpForward)Walk Forward (Forward)Block (DownForward)Duck (Down)Block (DownBack)Walk Back (Back)Back Flip (UpBack)Jump Kick (Fire+Up)Roundhouse Kick (Fire+UpForward)Mid Kick (Fire+Forward)Low Kick (Fire+DownForward)Duck &amp; Punch (Fire+Down)Sweep (Fire+DownBack)Turn Around (Fire+Back)Chest Punch (Fire+UpBack)8-bit versions (Amstrad CPC/ZX Spectrum):Main menu (Amstrad CPC)The Amstrad CPC/ZX Spectrum versions have an extra event, Sumo Wrestling, but no joystick editor to change the pre-programmed moves or to programm the joystick positions with sequences of moves. The scoring system is simpler than in the 16 bit versions since the fighters have no stamina levels in addition to the energy meter. Also no merit awards can be gained by the fighters - just gold, silver and bronze medals can be won. The four options that can be selected in the "main menu" when the program has loaded are:Number of players: Up to four players may enter the Oriental Games tournament.Enter humble name: Each player can input his or her name.Select controls: Here each player can choose his or her preferred method of control. When keyboard is selected the control keys can be defined by the players individually.Enter Oriental Games: Start the gameplay.After formalities are completed, the sixteen competitors names for the first event are shown in draw order. Finally the fighting display with the two comabtants facing each other appears and the action can start. Each combatant has an health bar and a score with the points scored for each hit. The bout is over when the health bar of one of the opponents decreases to zero or when one of the combatants scores 1000 points. The moves that can be performed in each event are listed below.The events:   EventMoves (How to execute)KendoJump (Up)High Parry (UpForward)Move Forwards (Forward)Low Parry (DownForward)Duck (Down)Jump Back (DownBack)Move Back (Back)Cross Bar (UpBack)Cleaver (Fire+Up)Head Blow (Fire+UpForward)Chest Blow (Fire+Forward)Stomach Blow (Fire+DownForward)Cut Throat (Fire+Down)Skimmer (Fire+DownBack)Turn Around (Fire+Back)Tornado (Fire+UpBack)KarateJump / Get Up (Up)High Lunge Punch (UpForward)Mover Forwards (Forward)Block / Grab (DownForward)Sweep (Down)The Elbow (DownBack)Move Backward (Back)Chop Stick (UpBack)Jump Kick (Fire+Up)High Kick (Fire+UpForward)Mid Kick (Fire+Forward)Reverse Punch (Fire+DownForward)Reverse Sweep (Fire+Down)Head Butt (Fire+DwonBack)Turn Around (Fire+Back)Roundhouse (Fire+UpBack)SumoDodge (Up)Walk Forwards (Forward)Duck (Down)Walk Backwards (Back)Slap (Fire+Up)Push (Fire+Forward)Grab (Fire+Down)Turn (Fire+Back)Kung FuScissor Kick / Get Up (Up)Forward Somersault (UpForward)Pounce (Forward)Double Forward Somersault (DownForward)Crouch (Down)Double Back Somersault (DownBack)Jump Back (Back)Back Somersault (UpBack)Flying Jumpkick (Fire+Up)High Kick (Fire+UpForward)Mid Kick (Fire+Forward)Low Kick (Fire+DownForward)Sweep (Fire+Down)Back Flip Kick (Fire+DownBack)Turn Around (Fire+Back)Roundhouse (Fire+UpBack)[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Out Run</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]OutRun is a Sega Arcade racing game that would popularize the "behind the car" view of many games in the same genre, along with Namco's Pole Position. It's best known for its iconic red convertible and the female passenger who would often turn to look at the player directly.Originating in the Arcade, the game would be ported and converted to a vast number of systems in its lifetime. It would also be included in a number of Sega compilations, as well as making a special appearance in Shenmue as one of the games-within-a-game.[CR]Development[CR]The inspiration behind the development of OutRun was born out of two things. The first was to overturn Namco, the developer (at the time) of the hugely successful Pole Position and a company synonymous with racing titles, to make Sega Japan's leading manufacturer of racing games. The second, surprisingly, was Yu Suzuki's love of the Burt Reynolds movie Cannonball Run. Suzuki states "The main impetus behind OutRun's creation was my love of a film called Cannonball Run. I thought it would be good to make a game like that."Suzuki took the development process very seriously and wanted to visit the locations where the courses and levels of his game would pass through. The film Cannonball Run is a pan-American road-race and Suzuki made plans to follow the same course and collect photographic, video and audio data along the way. However, he quickly realized there was a problem:"The film crosses America, so I made a plan to follow the same course and collect data as I went. But I realized, once I'd arranged everything, that the scenery along the course actually doesn't change very much so I revised my plan and decided to collect data in Europe instead..."[CR]Innovations[CR]OutRun departs significantly from Namco's popular Pole Position formula. This is most significant in how OutRun moves the setting away from the racing circuits towards the streets, with oncoming traffic, making it the first true street racing game, paving the way for modern street racers such as Need For Speed and Burnout.Force FeedbackThere are four versions of the OutRun Arcade cabinet: Deluxe and Standard moving models, an upright with a force-feedback wheel and a cockpit version without any movement.The early classic Arcade machine for OutRun features force-feedback. If the side of a wall is hit the player would get a slight jolt, but completely wipe out and reveal the mistake to everyone else present. The rumble brought a sense of immersion that most other Arcade games lacked at the time.Multiple PathsOutRun also features a unique way to play through the game. At the end of each area (or checkpoint) the road forks left and right. The way the player chooses to go decides if the next track is more difficult or less difficult. Some areas and paths are much more difficult than others, so it is best to choose wisely. Each path features different endings, most of which are often humorous.GradientOutRun is the first racing game to introduce the use of gradients, with the car climbing uphill and downhill along the course. The camera angle through which the player views the car is also significantly lower than other racing games, with a more over-the-shoulder viewpoint directly behind the car, giving it the feel of being in a car where the driver cannot see what is above or below a certain gradient, thus keeping the players always on their toes and bringing more excitement to the gameplay. The game was praised at the time for these innovations.[CR]Success[CR]The game's main competitor in 1986 was rival Konami's more traditional WEC Le Mans, which was initially the favorite at the time for its more sophisticated hydraulic cabinet. It was OutRun, however, which went on to become the much more popular game, selling more than 20,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, for hundreds of millions of dollars, along with ports to numerous home platforms.

The 28 levels are basically a big escort mission: in order to to protect the steadily moving ship, the player has to destroy all opposition waiting ahead in the usual shooter way. However, there are also blocks in the way which need to be destroyed by ramming them into each other. When they are destroyed in the correct way, they reveal power ups like new weapons, weapon upgrades, life energy, or shields. In order to keep the ship from crashing into non-destroyable blocks, the player has to connect to the ship and change the direction it steers to. When connected, the players own ship can't shoot.</plot>

			<title_clean>Oxyd 2</title_clean>
			<plot>Oxyd 2 is the successor of Oxyd, taking the basic gameplay of this game and extending it with new features. The goal in Oxyd 2 is to open all the &#8222;Oxyd&#8220; stones. These stones reveal symbols if touched and of each symbol there are two stones containing it. Opening the pair of stones of a symbol without touching another stone, both of them remain open. If all stones are opened, the level is finished. But, as the game contains a sophisticated physics simulation, there are many things making this difficult, like gravity, magnetism and others. Some stones or stone rows must be pushed out of the way (think Sokoban). There are new kind of stones and effects, like ropes connected to your ball pulling it in the direction of the ropes end.There are 100 levels for single players. Two computers can be connected by either Midi or serial cable and there are another 100 levels for playing with two players in the local network.The game disk itself can be freely distributed and contains the complete game. After level 10 there are stones which require a code, which is only available in the game book, which could be bought at Dongleware.</plot>

			<title_clean>Oxyd Magnum</title_clean>
			<plot>The third entry in the Oxyd series is also the first to be released on a purely commercial basis.  Like its predecessors, it is a real-time puzzle game where the player maneuvers a rolling ball through a series of landscapes.  Each landscape contains a number of "oxyd stones", which reveal colored symbols when hit; if the next stone you strike is an exact match, the two are unlocked.  To complete a level, all matching pairs must be exposed.Oxyd magnum! is single-player only, and contains 100 levels - each with a password, to let you continue later from the same point.  The levels get progressively harder as new elements are thrown into the mix: pits, bumps, mazes, teleports, hidden passages, sliding and rotating blocks, deadly water, laser beams (and mirrors), tiles that reverse your controls, and many more.  Some levels feature additional balls (controlled simultaneously or in turn), and others offer special items that let you manipulate the environment.  </plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pang, or Buster Bros./Pomping World, is a puzzle-action Arcade game where players are tasked with destroying balls or balloons that are terrorizing famous landmarks. The balls have a predictable path as they hop across the stage, but each will burst into smaller and harder to hit balls and in greater numbers will quickly overwhelm players.The player has a single harpoon gun that fires straight up and will damage a ball that touches any part of the chain. However, the player cannot fire again until the harpoon has hit the ceiling or one of the balls, which can put them at a disadvantage if they misfire. The player can earn power-ups that increase the number of simultaneous harpoons or allow them to stick to the ceiling for a few seconds.Pang was originally released as an Arcade game by Capcom. It was later ported to a vast number of computers and consoles. The majority of the US versions were renamed Buster Bros., including the Arcade game. It saw a few sequels as well, like Super Pang (the first sequel) and Buster Buddies (the second sequel, also known as Pang 3!). Both Pang and its sequels appeared in a few Capcom compilation releases too, such as Capcom Puzzle World for PSP.StagesThe stages appear in the following order:Mt. FujiMt.

			<title_clean>Paperboy</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]Paperboy ArcadePaperboy was released to arcades in 1984 by Atari Games. It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger LurksStatic obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.IncarnationsThere have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers!If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR]</plot>

Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...[CR]You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.[CR]It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</plot>

			<plot>The game showcases the African part of the 12th Paris-Dakar rally route officially sponsored by Tomahawk. Unlike the previous Paris-Dakar simulation, African Raiders-01, in this game the car is controlled directly from the cockpit. The drivers are visible, but the perspective is more 1st person than 3rd person.Starting in Tripoli (Lybie), the player races against computer drivers on six stages, visiting checkpoints located in Tumu (Lybie), N'Djamena (Tchad), Niamey (Niger), N&#233;ma (Mauritanie), Kayes (Mali), and Dakar (Senegal). The road is marked by rocks on its sides on most stages, and the player should keep his car on the road. If the player misses a road, he has a limited amount of time to find it again, otherwise he will be penalized. On the second and fourth stages there is no road from the start, and the player must reach the finish on his own. The off-road environment is full of rocks, animal corpses, and other debris. The player should not damage the car too much, otherwise he will be penalized as well. When a checkpoint is reached, a thematic animation sequence is shown for relaxation purposes.There are three difficulty levels to select from before the start of rally.</plot>

			<plot>The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics is to escape from the land of Kerovnia, where strange occurrences are routine. The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.[CR]The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.[CR]Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.</plot>

			<title_clean>Perfect Match</title_clean>
			<plot>Perfect Match is an educational game that mixes the gameplay of a concentration/memory game with the questions of a trivia game. The player is presented with a set of cards with each having a sentence on the hidden side. The task is to flip two cards to reveal their statements. When doing so the player will be asked if they match and if they do and the player answers yes the cards will be removed from the table and points will be earned. Answering wrong will lead to a loss of points. The game can be played by up to four players at a time and the player with the highest score when all cards have been removed wins the game. There are ten different question sets to play with as well as one with mixed questions. In addition to those there is an editor that allows the player to create new question sets for use in the game. </plot>

			<title_clean>Personal Nightmare</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Starting the game (PC EGA)Personal Nightmare was developed and published in 1989 by Horror Soft, a sub-label of Adventure Soft Publishing Ltd., and was their first foray into the horror genre, and their first game featuring the 80's horror icon Elvira(however she only appears as a mascot of the Horror Soft label on the box cover, the title and loading screens and is not involved as a active character in the event). The US version was also published in 1989 by Box Office Inc. and came with a different box art.It was the first game to make use of Horror Soft's new AGOS engine, which was originally created by Alan Cox and is based on AberMUD V, with graphical extensions.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In Personal Nightmare the player slips in the role of a vicar's son who has left home, the quaint little village of Tynham Cross, many years ago and lost contact with the parents. A surprising and troubling letter from his mother mades the player character decide to return to his village. According to this letter, the player's father, the local vicar has started behaving very strangely and has developed a keen interest in the life story of James Hyatt, who was vicar at the Church of St. Anthony some three hundred years earlier and was killed by his own parishioners apparently in some bizzare ritual to rid the village of some devil.The Dog &amp; Duck (PC EGA)Only a day before the visit the player receives a second disturbing letter, this time from his father, telling that he had made arrangements for the player to stay at the local inn, The Dog and Duck, because the house is being redecorated and the work wouldn't be completed in time for his visit. He also added that the player's mother had gone to visit her ill sister Alice in Campbelthorpe, hoping to return in time for the player's visit.After a long train journey the player finds himself in the bar of "The Dog and Duck" in order to check in and to start finding out what is going on in the village and what happend to his father.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Introduction (Atari ST)In the opening sequence a clergyman is incinerated in his pulpit and a demon is rising in his place and it is becoming clear that the local vicar, who's the father of the player character, has been replaced by the devil. It also turns out that the devil has taken over the lives of some of the villagers, and horrific crimes are taking place in Tynham Cross. The object of the game is to identify which of the village characters have been taken over by the power of the devil and then, by presenting the village policeman with the evidence of their crimes, have them arrested. While doing this the player will meet and have to deal with one or two pets belonging to the devil, also there are one or two people who need rescuing before they are subjected to some rather unpleasant rituals.The game starts in the bar of the local inn "The Dog and Duck". Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones are behind the counter and the player can start to look around and question people as they come and go.The main area on the screen graphically displays the location the player is in and the events taking place within it. To the left of the screen are the direction icons with ten possible directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, UP and DOWN), and to the right is a panel with the clickable verb commands. The windows directly beneath these are the text response window and the text input window.In the pub (Amiga)The game makes use of a combination of text-based commands, clickable verbal commands and clickable objects to progress. It may also be played entirely by the use of the keyboard as a true text-adventure. But instead of typing commands, a verb can be selected from the panel on the right with the left mouse button and it will appear in the text input window at the bottom of the screen.An object can be selected by clicking on the appropriate part of the picture, and the whole command is then entered by clicking on the right mouse button. Whole sentences like "CUT FINGERS WITH SECATEURS" or "KILL DOG WITH STAKE" will be accepted by the parser.By clicking on the INV (inventory) button a graphical icon list with carried objects will appear. The ROOM button similarly displays all takeable objects in a given location. They can be taken by dragging into the INV icon.The player must complete the game before the next sermon at the village church, which is in 4 days. This means that all the possesed villagers must be put behind bars or be killed and the devil must be repelled within this time limit or the game is lost. But there are also many other incidents that can kill the player (ideally at night time) unless the player performs a proper action to avoid them. The time passes in a day and night cycle and some actions happen or can be executed only to a special time.  [CR]</plot>

The levels include ones based around spiders, snakes, dentists and similar, surely including something to scare anyone. To rescue the Galactic Emperor, you must negotiate all of these.[CR]The action is mostly one-dimensional blasting, but with distinct sections of flying to a level, flying around it, and then navigating an underground cavern. A simultaneous 2-player mode exists to make  things a little less daunting.</plot>

			<title_clean>Pick'n Pile</title_clean>
			<plot>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.[CR]In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</plot>

			<plot>Defender of the Crown puts the player in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.In addition to the basic 'build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may  engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories. </plot>

			<plot>Pinball Magic is for one or two players, working through a sequence of twelve tables. Each one has several letters on screen, usually in more than one place. Runnig the ball over each letter opens the exit; pass through this to reach the next screen. Completing a screen gives both players a new set of the 5 balls they start the game with.[CR]Tables look similar to 1950s designs, with 'mushroom' bumpers, points-based targets. A more electronic feel is added by 'black holes' yielding an extra life, a set of bricks to be cleared on one level, and an integrated 'fruit machine' segment on another.</plot>

			<plot>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter is a fighting game released by Atari Games in 1990. Though it was widely reviled by critics for its lackluster game play and fighting style, it is notable and revolutionary for being the first fighting game to utilize blue screen-captured digitized versions of real people for use as the games characters. This would later be used by the Mortal Kombat series, among others, to greater effect.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato. These three fighters operated in a similar fashion gameplay-wise but had their own unique attacks and fighting styles to make up for this.CharacterDescriptionBuzzBuzz is an ex-pro wrestler, has a slow movement speed but makes up for this in his brutal available attacks which included a body slam, a headbutt, and a pile driver.TyTy is slightly faster than Buzz, though not to a great degree. He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO.[CR]Ports[CR]Though the arcade version of Pit-Fighter quickly became irrelevant due to the introduction of Mortal Kombat and other highly successful fighters, it was ported to many home consoles and portable devices, which included the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amistrad, SNES, Genesis, Atari Lynx, Sinclair Spectrum and Game Boy. These ports varied widely in quality, though all retained the basic characters and gameplay style that Pit-Fighter was known for.The arcade version of Pit-Fighter was also featured in a recent greatest hit compilation known as Midway Arcade Treasures 2, which was available on Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube, as well as a PC-only compilation named Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition.[CR]</plot>

The lessons learned in the first game are reiterated here -- mainly, when to take Brad's clothes off and when to put them back on.[CR]This is still accomplished through a text parser, feeling your way around the world by scrutinizing brief descriptions and static, non-interactive screens colourfully illustrating available exits and the objects of your interest and desire.</plot>

			<title_clean>Platoon</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Platoon is an action game based on the 1986 movie of the same name. Though the film carried a stringent anti-war message and was not an action movie in the traditional sense, the game adaptation is a Vietnam War set shooter. The protagonist, Chris Taylor (played by Charlie Sheen in the movie), must somehow survive the war despite being stuck between hostile North Vietnamese troops and the ruthless officers in command of his platoon.The game was originally released on DOS and other home computers by Ocean Software, a British development and publishing studio that largely fared in poor quality license games. It was later ported to the NES by SunSoft.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game changes gameplay modes in every one of its four levels:The first is a side-scrolling action type game in which the player must maneuver through a jungle maze in order to reach a bridge lined with explosives.The second begins once the player finds the tunnels and switches to a first-person view. These sections play like first-person dungeon crawler games like Wizardry, though the player is required to gun down enemies when they appear.The third stage is a turret shooter, where the player is trapped in a foxhole and must repel oncoming enemies obscured by the darkness.The fourth and final stage is a vertical shoot 'em up in which the player must gun down soldiers that appear at the top of the screen while avoiding their fire and that of snipers in the bushes. This stage culminates with the climactic showdown between Taylor and Sgt. Barnes.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel, you play as rookie patrol officer Sonny Bonds as he tracks down the notorious drug dealer known as "The Death Angel" in the fictional town of Lytton, California. The player uses real police procedures (as outlined in the extensive instruction manual) to handle everything from routine traffic stops to a homicide. Originally released using the  Adventure Game Interpreter in 1987, the game was remade in glorious VGA in 1992 using the  SCI engine. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Pool is a game about pool billiard. There is one opponent to compete against (either controlled by the AI or another player) without further possibilities for customization. The control method is divided into two distinct parts: first the basic position of the cue is set in a top down view. After that the game switches to a first-person perspective where the player can fine-tune the cue to select the spin (the game gives the parameters of the current position). Finally the shot is performed with a mouse click. For both parts the player is on a time limit of about ten seconds each. </plot>

			<title_clean>Populous</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1989, Populous was the third offering of Peter Molyneux's then-nascent UK development studio, Bullfrog Productions, and it was the company's first title to be met with both widespread commercial success and a significant amount of critical recognition. Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover ArtAside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black &amp; White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of "retaining the feel" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit.ModesA mysterious confidant congratulates the player between missions.Populous has three main modes of play: Tutorial, Conquest, and Custom. The Tutorial mode consists of a preset map designed more than anything to allow players to familiarize themselves with the game's controls and the various powers at their disposal. Conquest is the main mode of Populous, which allows players to progress through a series of 500 maps, conquering one world at a time before moving on to the next. Player performance is key to progression in this mode, as the player does not simply progress in linear fashion through each map. Rather, the player's score at the end of each mission is taken as an indicator of one's relative skill, and the difficulty of the next mission is chosen as a direct reflection of said score. Mission objective do not change over the course of Conquest mode, though the aptitude of one's opposition (as well as the powers available to them) will increase over time. Several different terrain types come into play as well, though their effects on gameplay is decidedly subtle. Settlers can die more easily on a desert world, for example, and population growth is stunted on an ice planet. Though the player can save their game at any time, the name of each planet also serves as a password of sorts, allowing players to jump to a specific world by simply inputting its name. The final mode of play is Custom, which pulls triple duty of serving as the game's portal for playing scenarios with customized parameters, creating custom maps, and also connecting to a second player (via modem) for multiplayer skirmishes.Inspecting the Game WorldThe Information Shield, complete with Population Bars (sides)Seeing as the player has no real dominion over the individual activities of worshipers, various tools are provided to allow players to quickly survey their surroundings and also gauge the level of efficacy of followers and buildings. Individual targets can be selected at any time by using the Query button, which causes a shield icon to appear next to the selected object. This indicates that any information appearing in the upper-right status shield pertains specifically to this target (which can in turn be located at any time by using the Zoom to Shield button). The status shield is divided into four quadrants. The quadrant in the upper left simply indicates which side the selected target belongs to, with an ankh signifying good, and a skull signifying evil. The quadrant to its right shows the target's level of sophistication, with more advanced weapon icons indicating a greater level of technology. The lower left quadrant shows a representation of the selected target, while the lower right displays two bars. In the case of a building, these bars show overall defense in yellow on the left, and progress toward production of the next follower in green on the right. In the case of followers, two orange bars showing unit strength fill over time. Once both bars have been filled, the left bar changes to yellow, indicating that it is gauging higher strength values than before. On either side of the Information Shield are two additional bars which show the population size of both the good and evil players on the left and right sides respectively.QueryQueryThe Query button allows the player to quickly ascertain the strength of a given target, whether they be friendly or hostile. Querying a target will persist until another target is queried, so it is possible, for instance, to use it as an easy way to keep track of an opposing leader's activities, or, when used with Zoom to Shield, to be able to quickly shift focus to a location of the player's choosing.Zoom to ShieldZoom to ShieldThe Zoom to Shield command serves to quickly refocus the player's field of view upon the last queried target. Naturally, if the player has yet to use the Query function, the Zoom to Shield icon does nothing. This mainly serves to allow players to quickly see something that might not be covered by other Zoom functions.Zoom to LeaderZoom to LeaderPressing the Zoom to Leader button, unsurprisingly, centers the player's view upon the leader of their followers. If the player's people are currently leaderless, then this function will center the field of view upon the player's Papal Magnet, usually the site of their leader's demise, until such time as a new leader has been chosen.Zoom to KnightZoom to KnightThe function of the Zoom to Knight button changes depending on whether the player left- or right-clicks. Upon left-clicking, it will cycle between all knights that the player currently possesses; when right-clicking, however, it will rotate its focus instead through all of the player's various settlements.Zoom to BattleZoom to BattleA simple click of the Zoom to Battle button will jump the camera instantly to any active hostile engagements, and, if there are more than one, it will cycle between all confrontations upon additional clicks. Like most Zoom functions, if there are no valid targets to jump to, pressing the button has no effect.Divine MandatesThough no true control is given over one's followers (alternately called walkers) in Populous, as the object of their worship the player is given the prerogative to direct the focus of their attentions. There are four options for influencing the behavior of walkers, and regardless of which is chosen, the player's people will dutifully endeavor to conform to this mandate in order to better satisfy their god. Directives do not require manna in the same way that physical manifestations of power do, though at the same time their effects are not nearly as dramatic nor as immediate.Go to MagnetGo to MagnetThe Go to Magnet command instructs all followers to gather around their leader, who will in turn go toward the Papal Magnet. In situations where the player's leader has died, this instructs followers to head directly toward the Magnet, where the first follower to touch the Magnet will be appointed the new leader.SettleSettleFaithful who have been directed to settle will look around their environment for suitable land upon which to erect new buildings, with preference being given for unexplored areas. Regardless of where they choose to settle, settlers will always construct the largest settlement that their particular plot of land allows.Gather TogetherGather TogetherThe Gather Together function implores a player's followers to search for others of their tribe so that they might commune with them. If successful, the two walkers will band together, forming a single more powerful unit. If unsuccessful in finding others, a follower will simply attempt to construct more settlements.FightFightWalkers that have been instructed to fight will actively search for any non-allied units and attempt to defeat them before repeating the process. Much like the Gather Together mandate, if a follower is unable to find suitable targets in its immediate vicinity, it will choose instead to build new settlements.Divine InterventionOften it is required that a god take matters into its own hands, and for these situations there are a variety of choices for direct intervention. Just below the player's Information Shield is the Manna Bar, which shows what godly powers are currently available for use. Various icons representing specific powers are arrayed along this bar, and once the Manna Bar's indicator arrow has reached the icon for a specific power, this indicates that it can be used. These range from minor displays like slightly modifying the height of land to more cataclysmic ones like Armageddon. Having a larger number of followers will raise the manna indicator arrow quicker and also allow for more frequent use of powers, as manna can be replenished more quickly with more devotees.Raise/Lower LandRaise/Lower LandThe least expensive and ironically most important of the godly powers is the ability to raise and lower land, which helps primarily to make the environment more habitable for one's followers. Left-clicking while in this mode will raise the plot of land where the player's cursor currently resides, while right-clicking will lower it.Papal MagnetPapal MagnetPlacing a Papal Magnet on any are of the map will designate that point as a beacon to which allied followers are drawn. When a leader dies or is knighted, the Papal Magnate's position is fixed to the last place that the leader occupied, and cannot be repositioned until the player has appointed a new leader through the Go to Magnet command.EarthquakeEarthquakeThe Earthquake ability randomly rearranges all tiles withinin the player's current field of view, disrupting settlements and any other activities within the area. As the cheapest disruption spell available in most scenarios, it is one of the more common ways of hindering the development of rival walkers.SwampSwampUse of the Swamp ability creates a swamp on any flat surface within the field of view. Depending on mission parameters, this will swallow up either a single walker or all walkers who attempt to traverse it. Swamp tiles can only be destroyed by raising or lowering the land tile upon which they are situated.KnightKnightBy invoking the Knight ability, the player's current leader is transformed into a powerful knight that will tirelessly harass the enemy, killing walkers and burning settlements to the ground until it is killed. It is possible for a player to have multiple knights concurrently by selecting and knighting new leaders through the Papal Magnet.VolcanoVolcanoThe area within the field of view is dramatically raised and filled with rocky obstructions when the player summons a volcano. Use of this ability is primarily a disruption tactic much like the use of Earthquake, though the effects are much more time-consuming to reverse than its cheaper cousin.FloodFloodUnlike most land-altering invocations, Flood affects the entire map rather than limiting itself to only the player's field of view, raising the water level of the entire world by one. Special care should be taken before using it to ensure that one's own population won't be more adversely affected by this than the enemy's.ArmageddonArmageddonEssentially a game-ender, Armageddon razes all buildings on the map and calls all followers to the center of the level in order to wage a winner-takes-all showdown in which the player left standing is the ultimate victor. For players who are sure of their own tribe's superiority, this can save a significant amount of hassle.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Populous II</title_clean>
			<plot>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</plot>

			<plot>Potsworth the well-spoken dog and his Midnight Patrol chums (Rosie, Nick, Carter, Keiko and Freddy) were stars of a successful cartoon, one of the many Hanna-Barbera IPs turned into licensed games by Hi-Tec. The Nightmare Prince has stolen the Grand Dozer's sleep potion, and the pieces have been placed around the Dream Zone. The Midnight Patrol race into action to restore Dozer's decent night's sleep.The game takes place across 5 levels of platform action. There are many switches, which are activated by pushing crates onto them. Moving platforms and small ledges ensure a test of timing and planning. There are hidden paths and bonuses to uncover, and dying always puts you back where you die with an invincibility period. Each character has its own special weapon or feature, all activated by hitting the fire key or button.</plot>

			<title_clean>Power Drift</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Designed by Yu Suzuki and developed by Sega AM2 for the Arcades in 1988, Power Drift was the first kart racer, setting the template for more popular kart racers such as the Mario Kart series. The Sonic Drift series is, in many ways, a spiritual successor to Power Drift.The game was notable for its sprite-scaling graphics, which Yu Suzuki and Sega had used to great success with earlier racers like Hang-On and OutRun. It used them to create elaborate, surreal courses that seemed to rise and fall rapidly like rollercoasters.Power Drift was later ported to multiple home computers by Activision and to the PC Engine exclusively in Japan by Asmik Entertainment. It would later make its way onto Sega Arcade compilations for the Saturn and Dreamcast. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.[CR]There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.[CR]Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Monger, or Powermonger, is a god sim game from Populous creator Peter Molyneux. It builds on Populous, borrowing elements but adding a whole lot more besides, including a 3D map that can be rotated around to an extent and an "artificial life" engine that allows for complex AI behavior that occurs naturally with little amounts of input from the player.It was released on many European and Japanese home computers, as well as on the SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD consoles in multiple regions. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features a 3D game map, although camera movement was limited to rotating the map in 90-degree intervals and 8 pre-defined levels of zoom. Only the map itself is three dimensional, people, trees and other game objects where comprised of sprites. The game also features a fairly advanced "artificial life" engine. Each person seem to have a mind of their own and will go about his or her job, fishing, farming, shepherding, collecting wood or making items without any input from the player. On death, citizens and soldiers alike would rise heavenwards in angelic form. The player also have a query tool that can be used to see the name, sex, age, allegiance, vital stats, hometown and equipment for any given person they click on. While the player cannot form the land, their actions can still have some limited effect on the environment. For example if the player deforests a big area the weather pattern will change and more rain or snow (depending on season) will fall, making movement slower.The player starts out on each map with a small number of soldiers, and maybe a few towns already under their control. To win the map they need to tip the balance of power completely to their side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map, and kill any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, they can draft the locals into their army and take on bigger towns or enemy armies. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle and the player conquers the town they come under their command as well. The player can only control as many armies as they have captains so it's important to keep them alive - if a captain is killed his army is disbanded and his surviving solders go back to their town of origin. Unlike the main army which the main character commands, the subordinate captains have a "lag" time. The further away from the main character they are, the longer it takes for orders to reach them. When issuing orders via the captains, a useful and sometimes amusing feedback is provided: the affirmative voice sample is played at a pitch that signals the wisdom of the player's commands.Food is the single most important resource in the game, the expression "an army marches on its belly" is very true in Power Monger, therefore it is often smart to not to draft a whole town's population into an army, because an empty town will not produce food (or more people). Aside from friendly towns the player can also slaughter wandering sheep (by ordering the army to attack it), barter food from neutral towns, or kill an enemy captain and pillage his food supply. Aside from manpower and food towns can also provide equipment. Townspeople will occasionally make stuff, but to speed things up the player can order an army to "invent" at a friendly town. Depending on nearby resources and what posture the army is set to (passive, neutral or aggressive) the player's men will then go to work collecting resources and make items. As the more useful items can usually only be made in one or two towns on any given map these have great strategic importance.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The home versions of the Predator videogame, based on the first feature film of the same name starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer, differed between platforms. For instance, whereas the NES version of Predator was a side-scrolling platforming action game where Dutch moved left and right, the Commodore 64 and other home computer versions featured an expanded movement plane which gave Dutch the ability to strafe up and down (a la P.O.W. or Double Dragon, et cetera) in addition to walking left and right.[CR]NES Version[CR]The NES version of Predator featured two different gameplay modes. When fighting through the regular jungle modes, the player will find themselves platforming and blasting various creatures in addition to confronting Predators. Once in a while, though, the game will enter a one-on-one Predator mode, which features much larger sprites. With very little actual level design (i.e. no platforming) to speak of, the one-on-one modes has the player shooting debris that comes their way in addition to shooting power-up orbs to upgrade their weapon. During these modes the player will also be engaged in a one-on-one confrontation with a single Predator.Predator for the NES also featured branching paths which took the player through different sets of levels, though it was still necessary to play the same number of levels to complete the game. Curiously, any time after the first big branch in the paths (level 5), choosing to continue after a Game Over would send the player back to level 5, making the continue system late in the game practically useless.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with superficial similarity to Chuck Rock, although the games were developed simultaneously in different countries. You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms.[CR]These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.[CR]You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.</plot>

			<title_clean>Premier Manager</title_clean>
			<plot>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.[CR]The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).[CR]The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.[CR]The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.</plot>

			<plot>This football management game featured all five national English leagues. You started off managing one of the teams in the Conference, and had to try to reach the Premier league and win European competitions, either by improving your current club or by doing well enough to earn job offers elsewhere.[CR]For each match you had to select the team, and choose a formation and a set of match tactics - intensity of tackling, height and length of passes, and shooting range could all be varied. In total there were almost 500 permutations of these options, as well as 18 basic formations.[CR]You could sign players from other clubs, which involved making a financial offer to both club and payer and hoping that no other club offered more. Players who's contracts had expired could be signed for no club fee - so make sure all your players are under contract.[CR]You also had to negotiate sponsorship deals, plan ground improvements, ensure that injured players got the right treatment, set up training schedules, and hire backroom staff (such as coaches and scouts).</plot>

			<title_clean>Prince of Persia</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES versionAside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR]</plot>

			<plot>On ST and Amiga features a full range of jabs, uppercuts and weaves. All fights take place to realistic WBA rules, as you aim to rise the rankings and fight for the title. The crowd frequently shout encouragement and insults, which are displayed using speech bubbles.[CR]The 8-bit game is a little different, featuring illegal moves such as kicks and groin punches. There is a referee, so you'll have to wait for him to look away before using those moves. Fights last 15 rounds, and a knockout ends that round, not the entire fight.</plot>

			<plot>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.[CR]As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A woman held hostage (Amstrad CPC)Inspired by the arcade coin-op "Empire City: 1931" from the Japanese manufacturer Seibu Kaihatsu this game was developed and published by Infogrames in 1987 for western home and personal computers.Prohibition is a very early example of a first-person shooter where the player moves a gunsight around the playing area(which is a backdrop of dingy New York street of tenements several screens wide) and tries to take out as many appearing members of a criminal gang as possible before they can return fire.Hardware scrolling support (PC CGA)It was indexed by the German BPjS/BPjM in 1987 so it was illegal to sell or to make the game available to minors or to advertise for it in Germany.Another peculiarity of the game is the support of a four-way hardware scrolling in IBM CGA at 60 Hz which is achieved by clever timing tricks and shouldn't have been possible since there isn't enough video memory to fit more than one screen in CGA.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Swamped by gangland crime, the New York Police Department is unable to adequately police the city. A mercenary in the shape of the player has been called in to help control the ascending crime and to wipe out the city's gangsters.Monochromatic graphics (ZX Spectrum)An alternate story is given on some re-release box covers: Here the action takes place in the Chicago of 1931 where the Mafia led by the notorius Al Capone controls the city. The player is a street wise rookie cop from the east side of town, intent on putting an end to Al Capones reign of terror. The mission starts in the area of down-town Chicago known as the Fortress. This area consisting of appartment blocks, warehouses and garages forms the headquarters for Al Capone's illegal liquor distribution operation and is guarded by the Mafias most loyal gang members who must be eliminated.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prohibition can be controlled by joystick, keyboard or mouse(only on Atari ST). First thing that is seen at the beginning of the gameplay is a gunsight which has to be manoeuvred in eight directions across a backdrop of run-down tenements several screens wide. Only a small section of the opposite buildings is immediately visible. Moving the gunsight(horizontally, vertically and along the two diagonals) causes the opposite block to scroll which enables one to overview the whole street.Difficult target (C64)One by one enemies start to appear in various locations of the opposite buildings like at windows, rooftops, doors, oppenings, on the sidewalk and even from under manhole covers. The aim of the game is to scan the buildings and shoot down the gangsters one at a time. Each kill, also called contract, is awarded with dollars.If a gangster comes out of hiding in a part of the playing area not within the current field of view then an arrow at the bottom of the screen points toward the target but doesn't give the enemies vertical position.Dodging (Atari ST)A gangster must be hit within three seconds after an onscreen countdown, that is shown numerically at the side of the screen, begins. When opponents lurk in difficult positions extra time is given to kill them. But if the gangster isn't shot before the countdown runs out the player dies, unless dodged, in a hail of return fire and loses one of three lives.Enemy bullets can be dodged by pressing the dodge key. The dodge key protects the player from the bullets and resumes the countdown timer, giving one another chance to locate and kill the opposition. But such evasive action can't be carried out indefinitley and a second meter displays the total amount of dodge time remaining.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.[CR]A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.[CR]The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.[CR]The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths.  League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.</plot>

			<plot>Protector takes the idea from Defender: the player is controlling a ship over a horizontally scrolling landscape, able to fly to the left and right with different speed. Some residents of the planet are standing on the floor, with alien ships trying to kidnap them. The player has to prevent that by destroying all the enemy ships first. This can be done with the laser cannon or smart-bombs. If all enemies in a level are destroyed the level is finished. A radar helps to keep track of the enemies in the level.</plot>

			<plot>You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. [CR]Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. [CR]The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path  spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.[CR]Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.[CR]The game is available for 1 or 2 players.</plot>

			<title_clean>Psycho</title_clean>
			<plot>Psycho is a graphic adventure game with a key-based verb interface.[CR]A set of jewels has been stolen. At the time of the theft, a curator was with the jewels, so he got stolen, too. And who's the suspect? Norman Bates, of course. The next night, a daring detective drives out to the sinister Bates Motel. His plan: a) find the jewels, b) free the curator and c) take a nice hot shower, should time suffice.[CR]Psycho is entirely controlled with the keyboard: direction keys for moving your character around, shortcut keys for performing actions. You need to stand close to an interesting object in order to examine it. Adversaries will appear at random throughout the house, putting you to sleep by touch and thus draining your precious time -- you've only got four hours to solve the case. You may shoot the enemies as soon as you find a weapon. As there is no other option for character interaction, this is how you'll deal with the Bates family as well.</plot>

			<plot>Puffy and his fortuitously-named girlfriend Puffyn are trapped in an alien world full of threats, traps and surprises. Taking control of one or the other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move faster) you must find your way through.[CR]Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.[CR]Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</plot>

			<title_clean>Push Over</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pushover is a puzzle platformer that was sponsored by the British potato-based snack called Quavers. The gist of the story is that the Quavers mascot, a character named Colin Curly, has lost his packets of Quavers down an ant hill. The SNES version saw Colin Curly being changed to Captain Rat and the Quavers replaced by bundles of cash. The game was originally designed before the Quavers brand was tacked on, and received some good reviews.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls an ant called G.I. Ant, who has to return Colin's favorite snack by pushing over a number of dominoes. The object is to knock over a key domino that will open up a door to the next level. This is done by picking up and move dominoes around the screen, arranging them, and utilizing their special abilities (see below). The player is only able to push one domino, so the sequence must be planned out in advance.There are many ways in which levels can be made unwinnable; for one thing, there is a time limit for each of the 100 levels and if this runs out the player is able to continue with the level but is unable to move onto the next. All the dominoes must also be knocked over to complete the level, and G.I. Ant must be able to get to the exit door. G.I. Ant himself can also die, either by falling from a great height, falling through the gaps at the bottom of the screen or the death from above i.e. a domino falling on top of him.There are 9 different themes that the levels are based on: a castle, a dungeon, an Aztec temple, the inside of a PC, a space station, a factory/industrial theme, a Meccano based world, a Japanese house, and a Greek building. After every 10 levels, there is a cutscene of G.I. Ant handing a very grateful Colin his bag of Quavers.Domino TypesStandard - Basic type of domino.Stopper - Dominoes that don't topple over and rebounds any other types of dominoes that fall against them.Delay - Standard domino that wobbles for a short time before falling over. In that time they act like a Stopper. Ascender - Dominoes that can fly upwards.Bridger - This domino can bridge gaps of one space, and another domino can be placed on top.Exploder - This type is opposite of the Bridger dominoes and will explode, creating a gap in the ledge. The resulting explosion may damage ladders.Vanisher - These dominoes vanish once they land.Splitter - The Splitter domino divides into two separate dominoes when it is hit.Tumbler - The tumbler domino can fall over edges. Once it falls, it pops back up and continues to flip along.Trigger - The final domino that must fall to finish the level.  [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color.[CR]At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout.[CR]The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.</plot>

			<plot>Quartz is a shoot 'em up with a variety of sections. The first section (and every odd-numbered one) is viewed from above and scrolls in every direction. As well as standard attack waves, there are large red/blue/yellow balls which split on impact a l Asteroids, and once the smallest ones are destroyed they release tokens. Once you have collected 9 of each, you can choose a power-up form a range including various weapons, restart points (which effectively gives infinite continues when used with an emulator's 'snapshot' feature) and repairs to the ship. Destroying the whole of standard waves gives combined tokens which add one to each of the three colours.[CR]The even-numbered waves scroll in a single direction, but include waves coming at you from other directions, even from within the screen in 3D. You can have up to 3 power-ups stored on your ship at a time, and choose one to activate by pressing F1-F3 - they all have limited firepower. Unusually, when you have no lives left, death results not in game over, but the loss of one of your power-ups (chosen by you).</plot>

[CR]Between the levels to acquire a bonus you (without ability to shoot) should break through different arcade sequences such as fly through the series of small asteroids, or enemy space jets, or acquire the bullets or enhanced weapon avoiding the collisions. [CR]Each collision means decrease of your available space jets, which quantity may increase with the score. Also the amount of bullets for each your space jets on each level is limited so shoot wisely. [CR]Finishing the game you may be enlisted in High Score table.</plot>

			<title_clean>Questron II</title_clean>
			<plot>As the second title in the Questron series, this game follows the same basic formula as the original. You start out as a lowly peasant with only a few gold coins in your pocket and a bad attitude to defend yourself. By stumbling around the countryside and fighting hordes of creatures, you gain wealth, experience, and title.[CR]Questron II spans two continents, Landor and the Realm of Sorcerers. Additionally, there are the requisite tombs, castles, and dungeons. In the first Questron, your goal was to defeat the evil Wizard Mantor. Now, in Questron II, the good Wizard Mesron has sent you back in time before the Book of Magic was created. Your goal is to defeat the six Mad Sorcerers before they can create the book.</plot>

			<plot>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.[CR]Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. [CR]The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.[CR]There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.</plot>

			<plot>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different. </plot>

			<title_clean>Rainbow Islands</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rainbow Islands is the official sequel to Taito's Bubble Bobble, once again featuring Bub and Bob (a.k.a. Bubblun and Bobblun), who returned to their original human forms at the end of Bubble Bobble. This time they are charged with rescuing the titular Rainbow Islands from an entity named Dark Shadow.The game was originally released as an Arcade title in 1987 but has been ported to several home computer systems including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and later the Amiga and Atari ST. Several other iterations have also been released on the early 8 and 16 bit consoles.A platforming game at its core, there are ten islands to beat (dependent on the platform), each one with a different theme that become progressively more difficult.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The aim of the game is to scale to the top of each level. Using the main characters' ability to cast Rainbows, the player can use these as platforms to advance up the level. The Rainbows can also be used as a weapon to defeat enemies by trapping them under the Rainbow and then jumping onto it, breaking it and killing the enemy in the process. The added pressure of each level sinking into the sea means the player has to work their way through the level as quickly as possible.If a rainbow kills an enemy after it has been fired, rather than killing an enemy by collision as the rainbow is fired, it causes the enemy to spawn a diamond. By collecting all 7 diamonds (one of each color of the rainbow) an extra life is gained. In addition a giant diamond will spawn upon defeating the boss at the end of a stage.Collecting all of the giant diamonds results in having 3 extra islands to play in some releases of the game.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The arcade release soundtrack sounded very similar to the song "(Somewhere) Over The Rainbow" from the TV musical "The Wizard Of Oz". This soundtrack made it into the Japanese versions of the Famicon and Genesis releases as well as the European and US releases on Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad)In later releases, such as the Sega Master System, NES and Playstation, the music was changed subtly to prevent any copyright infringement.[CR]Ports[CR]Rainbow Islands was originally an arcade release but has been ported to several home consoles and computers, Including The Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad in 1989 by Ocean Interactive. The Amiga and Atari ST versions were also ported by Ocean Interactive in 1990. Taito converted the game to the Genesis in 1990, the NES in 1988 and the Sega Master System in 1993.The Sega Master System version suffers from a glitch making it impossible to reach the 8th Island and thus impossible to complete the game.The Famicom/NES version in Japan and US had original levels and graphics and differs greatly from the more faithful European port.Later releases with upgraded visuals were released in 1996 for the Playstation, PC and Sega Saturn.It appeared on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009, again with newer upgraded visuals.[CR]Power Ups[CR]As well as featuring the characters from Bubble Bobble, the game also shares many of the collectibles from the game, such as:Red Shoes: Increase player speedRed Potion: Increase rainbow speedRed Potion: Adds a rainbow (maximum 3)Crystal Ball: Enemies become characters from Bubble Bobble when they dieOther items from Bubble Bobble that are only for points include: Rings, Bracelets, Colored Lamps, Canes, Colored Bottles and diamonds.Other items off different rarity also appear throughout the game such as the Book, Rainbow Necklace, Clock and Blue Goblet.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Rambo III</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Based on the 1989 movie of the same name, the player must use John Rambo's finely honed martial skills to rescue his friend, mentor, and former commander Colonel Trautman from the Soviet forces during their occupation of Afghanistan. Played from a top-down perspective in-level, with over-the-shoulder perspective boss fights between levels, Rambo uses his AK-47, blocks of C-4, explosive tipped arrows and, of course, his enormous K-BAR knife to fight his way in and out of the 6 levels in the game.The game also had Rambo accomplishing a variety of mission objectives, including rescuing prisoners, taking out Soviet supplies, and shooting down HIND helicopters with explosive arrows. Some game mechanics included item refills though the use of the combat knife - enemies dispatched with the knife usually leave behind items. This exposed Rambo to additional danger however, since the game employed a one-hit-wonder health system, forcing the player to weigh the risks and rewards of going after those items.[CR]SMS Version[CR]The Sega Master System version of Rambo III is a light-gun game, rather than the top-down shooter found on other systems. Though more similar mechanically to the "behind-the-shoulder" TPS Arcade version, very little of the game appears to have anything to do with the plot of Rambo III, as the generic enemies look nothing like Soviet soldiers. It's possible the game was at one point a generic light gun game and had the Rambo III license bolted onto it late during its development.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]City being destroyed by a monster!Rampage was first released in arcades in 1986 by Bally Midway. Taking inspiration from giant-monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong, Rampage puts players in the role of one of three oversized monsters-- George the ape, Lizzie the lizard, and Ralph the wolf.The players start wreaking havoc in Peoria, Illinois, then cut a path of destruction through the United States. In the arcade version, the monsters' attacks take place over 128 days. After those days end, the cities start to repeat, and after five cycles you get to day 768 and the days reset to 1. The console iterations had an actual ending added. The goal in each stage is to knock down every building in the city. The monsters can climb up the sides of buildings and punch out sections of their walls, occasionally eating the hapless humans that they find inside. Take out enough pieces of a building and it will come crashing down. Watch out, though--the National Guard is out in force and will harass the monsters with tanks and jets. If enough damage is taken, the monster will revert to its original human form, sans clothes. In a multiplayer situation, any remaining monsters can grab and eat the ex-monster.Rampage has seen a number of remakes and sequels over the years with varying degrees of success. Follow-ups include Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2: Universal Tour, Rampage Through Time, and Rampage Puzzle Attack, though none of them have garnered the same positive response as the original.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Rampart</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rampart is a strategy/puzzle/action game in which the player alternately builds fortifications and then destroys invading enemy forces with the artillery within those fortifications. After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the arcade, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR]Cultural Impact[CR]The current world record score for Rampart is 41,180, achieved by Mark Boolman in Bloomington, Illinois under referee verification on March 28th 2008.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Ranarama</title_clean>
			<plot>Ranarama was an early example of combining RPG elements into an action game to allow the player's character to grow in power throughout the game. This is done by allowing the player to collect runes from defeated wizards, which could then be combined to unlock new spells. The user is able to have one spell in each of four categories active at the same time: power, offense, defense and utility.The power spell category represented the user's combined health and magic pool, which is depleted by using spells or being hurt by enemies. If it became completely depleted, the user would revert to the lowest power spell called "Mortal". If the mortal pool was depleted before the user was able to cast a different power spell, the game ended.Offense spells are the player's ranged attack. More powerful spells in this area destroy enemies quicker, but also sap more energy from the player's power pool.Defense spells are effectively the player's shield, absorbing more damage which would otherwise damage the player's power pool when struck by enemy attacks.Utility spells offer the most varied set of uses, each being slightly different. For example, "See" allowed the user to locate enemy wizards on revealed portions of the level map, while "Conflagrate" would cause area effect damage to all enemies on screen when activated.The goal in the game is to clear each level of all wizards, though the structure of the game was quite freeform. It is possible to leap between levels before clearing out all wizards, though without having collected runes from earlier wizards, the player would have a tough time surviving in harder levels. Once all levels have been cleared, the game starts resets, allowing play to continue with a new tile set. In this case the player also gets to keep their accumulated runes and spells.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Reach for the Skies is a combat flight sim focused on WWII's famous "Battle of Britain", splitting the battle into four stages and giving you the option to take part for either the Royal Air Force or the German Luftwaffe. As well as piloting a plane, you can also take on Controller duties, of planning which planes to deploy where on each day, trying to minimise losses. [CR]Eight planes are simulated, from Hurricanes and Spitfires to Ju88s and BF110s, each with their own cockpit displays and characteristics. When playing as the Germans, protecting the fragile and slow Ju88 bombers is crucial. There is a practice mode with indestructible planes, realism levels can be adjusted, and time can be accelerated while an enemy plane is not in sight.</plot>

			<plot>A 3-player top-down arcade game where one player controls one of three unidentified ghost-busters. The game is based off of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, rather than strictly off the movie franchise.  The player can choose between a red, yellow or blue-jumpsuited character though all have the same abilities. These powers include an energy gun that transforms a hostile monster into a harmless, basic ghost, which are then captured using the proton beam. Other abilities are an invincibility field and the ability to summon   Slimer to absorb attacks instead of the player.  In Japan the game is known as Meikyuu Hunter G, but bears little  resemblance to the western version as it did not use the Ghostbusters  license.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. [CR]The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels.[CR]One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.</plot>

			<plot>The Soviet Union, under severe pressure after destruction of one of their biggest oil refineries, must secure a new source of oil, and to do that, they must disable the West... which means they must invade Europe and fight NATO to a standstill... And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries. [CR]You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare.</plot>

			<title_clean>Renegade</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Renegade is a beat 'em up game using 2D sprites that can move in three dimensions. It uses a system of a fixed location where the player has to fend off waves of opponents until their numbers dwindle, and the stage boss appears to intervene. Two sequels to Renegade were made: Target: Renegade and Renegade 3: The Final Chapter. Neither of the sequels were developed by Technos.Renegade (as an arcade game) is notable for being a western localization of Nekketsu K&#333;ha Kunio-kun. The notability is that the sprite and stage changes are heavily influenced by the 1979 film 'The Warriors'. No lawsuit was ever made against the game for such similarities.Renegade uses various combat techniques that were progressive for beat-em ups of its era. These included reverse attacks (attacking an opponent behind the player), grab attacks and the ability to 'mount' and attack downed enemies. It could be argued that even much later games in the style, such as Final Fight, were influenced by Renegade.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>This typically zany Jeff Minter  title sets you as a mutated camel, with an optional support one mimicking your moves elsewhere. The hordes of enemies to be taken on include falling umbrellas and drinks machines. Shot enemies release tokens ranging from points bonuses and energy recharges to control-reversers and poison.[CR]Speaking of controls, the game uses the same system as Llamatron, which means that you fire automatically in the direction you're moving, but pressing the fire button allows you to rotate the direction of fire while immobile. This allows enemies in different parts of the screen to be attacked from less precarious positions.</plot>

			<title_clean>Rick Dangerous</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title ScreenRick Dangerous is a platform game with a few minor puzzle elements. Thematically the game and its main character are loosely based on Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1945 with Rick being a British Agent who raids tombs and fights the Nazis (who are never mentioned by name).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is based on linear progression through four separate levels. The levels have their individual themes and contain many traps with no visible warnings which will instantly kill the player, making the game more about trial &amp; error pattern memorization than most platform games. What little story exists is told before each level in two to three paragraphs of text with a small film strip animation.Rick can walk, jump, crawl and has a revolver, dynamite and a stick (used to set of certain switches and stun enemies). The revolver and dynamite both have limited ammunition, a maximum of six each, and although more can be found throughout the level ammo is generally quite scarce.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The homage to Raiders of the Lost ArkSouth America: Rick's plane crashes over the Amazon while he is in search of the Goolu tribe. This level is based on the opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark (including a boulder chase sequence at the beginning), set in a cave with Goolu tribesmen and golden headpieces as collectable treasures.Egypt: Rick heads to the pyramids at the request of London to retrieve the Jewel of Ankhel from a group of fanatics who are threatening to smash it if a ransom is not paid.Schwarzendumpf Castle: Rick must rescue a group of captured allied prisoners from the castle. This is the first level which introduces the pseudo-nazis.Missile Base: Upon rescuing the allied soldiers in the previous level, a plot to attack London from the enemies secret missile base is unveiled.[CR][B]Ending:[/B][CR]Rick returns to London after thwarting the Nazi's plans to destroy it, only to find that it is under attack by aliens. This leads directly into the events of Rick Dangerous 2, which drops the Indiana Jones motif for a Flash Gordon inspired aesthetic.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The second in the Rick Dangerous series, Rick Dangerous 2 continues the tradition of comedy puzzle platforming and instant death traps with invisible triggers. This game ditches the Indiana Jones motif in the opening scenes opting instead for a Flash Gordon inspired character designs and settings. Released in 1989, it was developed by Core Design and published by MicroStyle. It was favourably by critics of the time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Rick Dangerous 2 follows the same gameplay mechanics of its predecessor, with some minor tweaks to Rick's abilities and the overall structure of the levels. The most notable change to the game is that the player can now choose to tackle any of the four levels in any order they choose, opening up a fifth and final level once the other four have been completed (however the levels must be completed in order if the player wishes to see the endgame movie). Like the first game, each of the levels have their own distinct themes and enemies. Various references are made throughout the game to the game's final boss, known only as "The Fat Guy," leading to a more cohesive storyline (however marginal) than the first game.Rick's stick, pistol and dynamite have been replaced with a ray gun, a punch and bombs. While the first two changes are purely cosmetic in keeping with the overall tonal shift in the game, the bombs can now be slid as well as merely placed opening up new puzzle situations in the levels.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Hyde Park, Earth: Continuing on from the final scenes of the first Rick Dangerous, London is besieged by aliens. Rick heads to Hyde Park, the landing site of the strange alien craft.Ice Caverns of Freezia: Rick seizes control of the strange alien craft, heading to the mysterious planet Barf and the Fat Guy's Headquarters. However the Fat Guy was never particularly generous with fuel, causing Rick to crash land over the desolate ice kingdom of Freezia.Forest of Vegetablia: Rick attempts to teleport directly to the Fat Guy's headquarters from Freezia, but instead ends up deep in the forests of Vegetablia. This level is unique in that it is essentially a giant maze, with multiple paths to the end.Atomic Mud Mines: In order to reach the Fat Guy's Headquarters, Rick must first pass through the Atomic Mud Mines.The Fat Guy's Headquarters: The final level, complete with a boss fight with the Fat Guy whom the player has been chasing for the majority of the game.[CR][B]Ending:[/B][CR]The game closes on a cliffhanger with the Fat Guy escaping through a teleporter and Rick following him with the caption "What will Rick do next?" No sequel was ever made, despite this game alluding to one.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Rings of Zilfin</title_clean>
			<plot>Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than on character stats.[CR]The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos' minions, and leaves his home village. [CR]After "character creation" (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way.[CR]The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of the game is played in towns or travelling between them.[CR]When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are "magic mushrooms" and some other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this game.[CR]While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos' minions, which results in some pseudo-real time combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course.[CR]The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and you have to prepare the spell first.[CR]The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, like "G" for getting things or "C" for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and loaded at the main menu.</plot>

			<plot>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Roadwar 2000 is a  post-apocalyptic tactical game set in what is left of the United States and whose gameplay is primarily based on vehicular combat. The player is in charge of a group of individuals armed with various vehicles and must manage their resources and dictate their actions in a bid to survive and discover the cure to a terrible plague sweeping the nation.  After successfully building and maintaining a strong force, the player may eventually be approached by what is left of the US Government to find six scientists that may hold the final pieces of the cure needed to stop the bio-engineered plague still infecting the nation.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   On March 29, 1999, the first cases of an extremely virulent plague are reported in Washington DC. According a journal chronicling the plague, the virus is extremely debilitating with death as the end result. On May 7th, it has spread across the nation. But the cause has been discovered: a bacterium that has three different growth stages. The first stage is a pupal stage, much like a caterpillar. The second stage does damage to the neurological system of the human body. The third stage, which occurs two months later, results in death.  By May 27th, it is discovered that the plague had been spread by fanaticists using fake passports and was an intentional attack on the United States.  On June 8th, one of the fanatics has been captured and is willing to talk. Scientists working for their sect had developed the genetically engineered bacteria, injected one hundred volunteers, and then sent them into the United States. Nearly 82% of the country has already been infected. But the most revealing piece of information was that the sect had also developed a cure. Of course, the fanatic wasn't willing to share any other information concerning it.  By June 13th, the country has begun to descend into anarchy. Most of the leadership including the President and Congress are laid up in hospitals if they are still alive. Meanwhile, the task force assigned to find a cure feverishly attempt to continue their work.  On July 7th, one of the Secretaries of the United States calls the bunker warning them that things are slipping from their control faster than expected. The scientists claim that they are close to a breakthrough.  The scientific team are given vitamin pellets to supplement their own food supplies on July 8th as the Secretary tells them of the plans to relocate them to secure locations.     The bombs fell on July 20th hitting strategic cities. With most of the United States' defenses already damaged by the crippling plague, there was nothing to stop them. But not all of the weapons had gone off, leaving certain cities with an unexploded nuclear device sitting at their heart. People flee the irradiated zones. Those strong enough to enforce their own rule take control of certain areas within these devastated ruins.   Many of the gangs secure their power through the use of politicians that they find to work for them, doctors that can heal the sick (if not cure the plague), and a drill officer that can train their men.  On August 2nd, the invaders arrive by landing on the coasts or by moving through Mexico. Inoculated against the plague, they make progress. With most of the nation's infrastructure shattered, little word makes it back to the main bunker where the research continues, although word reaches them from one of the eight scientists sent out that a breakthrough is very close.  On August 21st, it is discovered that the radiation from the bombs has mutated the bacterium, causing intense rage and uncontrolled violence within the infected now dubbed the "mutants". With its mutation, the serum used by the invaders to protect themselves fails and their own ranks are infected by this new strain. A new vaccine is available, but the cure requires the price of having to heal everyone in a group at once or risk reinfection, further depleting the scarce resources.  By October 6th, travel has become all but impossible. By November 20th, supplies begin to dwindle at the main bunker. A plan is initiated to find help by picking one of the gang leaders to aid them in bringing the scientists back.  By December 25th, the journal's author writes his final entry. Now only the player can save what is left of the United States in a bid for survival. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   On starting the game, the player is randomly placed in one of the cities left somewhat intact within the United States. Most of the game places the player in the management role of their gang; allocating resources, managing their manpower, and gathering recruits to build up their cause. The game is turn based with each representing one hour.  Experience improves the effectiveness of your gang members, although there are no levels. Combat can also expand the number of vehicles that the player can have at their disposal. Cities can be looted once their defenders have been defeated and supplies are almost always in demand, especially fuel.   The game is viewed from a top-down perspective allowing the player to view such things as roads, obstacles, and potential destinations (such as cities) and natural landmarks such as lakes, rivers, and mountains. Most of the controls are handled via hotkey commands and movement is also keyboard controlled. The game also uses a series of random encounters.  Many large cities are held by powerful gangs with their own small armies and many of these must be taken by the player in order to initiate the main quest in the game: recovering the scientists that have the cure to the disease.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In Road Wars you are set charging up a long hilly road, trying to make a road safe after a protection malfunction. Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.[CR]You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.</plot>

			<title_clean>Robinson's Requiem</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Robinson's Requiem essentially dumps the player onto the mysterious planet Zarathustra, with literally nothing but their clothing. Survival is the player's primary goal. Collecting the equipment lost during the crash is a secondary, but important goal, as all the equipment is needed to beat the game. An overall plot is also uncovered, with specific objectives received telepathically through dreams.To survive, the player must make use of their environment. Using a hollow gourd on a water source fills the gourd with drinkable water. Using a survival knife on a tree creates branches which can be used to start a fire. These resources will be used to keep the player healthy, with a wide variety of maladies facing the unprepared explorer. The game tracks everything from the player's body temperature to their blood pressure, which all have expected consequences. If the player sleeps out in the cold, they have a chance to develop a flu. If they drink un-boiled water, they can get sick. The player can faint, go into shock, or require tranquilizers to calm shot nerves. They can be in so much pain that they cannot sleep.External damage is similarly modeled, and mended with sutures, shots, and disinfectants. Players can break limbs by falling on the environment, slowing their movement speed and affecting their vitals. Untreated lacerations can develop infections. Famously, crows can peck out the player character's eyes, and limbs can become so gangrenous that they require amputation - which the player can do with a tourniquet and a sharp enough knife. Ouch.The game was re-released on GOG.com. The Jaguar CD version was canceled during development due to the imminent demise of the system, but retro game specialists Songbird Productions restored and published the game in 2011.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In the future, a fascist global government sends handfuls of trained citizens to report on unexplored worlds. Called "Robinsons" (after Robinson Crusoe), these explorers arrive with minimal equipment, and live off the land for five years. When they retire, they are welcomed back to Earth as heroes with a grand celebration called a Robinson's Requiem.The player controls "Trepliev 1," a veteran Robinson on his last mission before his Requiem. Upon approaching the planet Zarathustra, magnetic shields around the planet force his ship to crash. He quickly learns that Zarathustra is set up as the "last stop" for all Robinsons, whom the government never intended to make it back to Earth. Surrounded by wild animals, untamed nature, and other surviving Robinsons in various mental states, Trepliev 1 must fight to live long enough to try and find a way off the planet.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Robocop</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop is a licensed sci-fi side-scrolling shooter based on the 1987 movie about the titular cop cyborg. It loosely follows the events of the movie, pitting RoboCop against gun-toting criminals and the ED-209 bipedal robot.The original Arcade game was developed by Data East (though some sources also say Nihon Bussan) in 1988 and ported to numerous home computers in the US and Europe. Most of the European releases were handled by Ocean Software. Japanese developer SAS Sakata developed the 1989 NES port. The Commodore 64 and Game Boy versions of the game are subtly different from the rest, featuring a different plot unrelated to the movie, but still contains similar gameplay. Music from the Game Boy game, composed by Jonathon Dunn and based on the C64 soundtrack, was used in an European TV advert for the kitchen appliance company Ariston.Data East and Ocean Software would go on to produce sequels that looked and played similarly, based on the movies RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3 and the 1992 Dark Horse comic book series RoboCop Versus The Terminator.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>RoboCop 2 is a mission-based platform game. Missions have various objectives, such as destroying nukes or killing all the enemies. If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.</plot>

			<plot>F29 Retaliator authors DID developed this particular use of the Robocop license, and produced something different from most film licenses. While it featured a succession of levels based around sections of the movie, these were highly varied and presented in polygon 3D graphics. These can be played in any order in the Arcade mode, or in planned sequence in the Movie Adventure mode, which follows the film's plot of Japanese investors wishing to replace Robocop with their Robot Ninja designs, and thus expecting him to prove himself as superior.[CR]The first task is a car chase resembling Chase HQ, in which a mazey section of road must be followed efficiently. There are several first-person 3D shooing sections,. in which you must use a target to shoot down punks and invaders, without harming civilians. Robocop also takes to the skies in a simulation of his new Gyropack flying device. Also, he must do battle with his intended replacement in a fixed-perspective beat 'em up section.</plot>

			<plot>The exploration space vessel "DARWIN 8" is in troubles: it is invaded by alien robots, who killed the whole crew, leaving the player as last survivor to fight the intruders and clear the ship.The player blasts his way through 40 levels shooting robots. But there is a problem: the robots are protected by "positronic generators", which have to be destroyed before the moving robots are receiving damage from your weapon. With active generators, a hit with the weapon only stuns them for a very short time. In each level there is at least one of those generators, in others there are up to three. Clearing a level fast awards you with extra points depending on the time remaining, while running out of time is punished with a life loss.The levels are presented as single screens, with deadly walls in them: touching a stone instantly kills the player, which is also happening on a single hit from any of the robots shots. The level maps are pre-defined and always the same, but on each level start or dying, the position of both the robots and generator are randomly chosen. After each seven levels, the player gains an extra life.The game was published as cover disk for ST Format, but released into the public domain soon after. In 2010 an extended port with original graphics was released, named Robotz DX.</plot>

			<plot>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.[CR]The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</plot>

[CR]There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.[CR]When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.[CR]Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.[CR]In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</plot>

			<title_clean>Rogue</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally developed around 1980 on the UNIX operating system, Rogue became popular on college systems throughout the early 1980s. The original authors of Rogue were Michael Toy, Glenn Wichman and Ken Arnold. Because of the game's success, Michael Toy and Jon Lane ported the title to IBM PC, and later it was ported to Macintosh by Michael Toy. The franchise's marketing was eventually handed over to publisher Epyx, who Amiga, Atari ST and CoCo versions. Further ports were handled by Mastertronic in 1988 for AMSTRAD CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Rogue is the quintessential fantasy dungeon crawler, sending the player down through many levels on a quest to recover the Amulet of Yendor (Rodney backwards), and return with it to the surface. Since the levels become increasingly more challenging, completing the game is notoriously difficult. The game's original graphics consist solely of ASCII; the player character is represented on screen by the "@" symbol; this was changed to "&#9786;" in a later port. As well as this, different letters and symbols represent different enemies, items, and the environment. Later versions added sprite-based graphics, but ASCII graphics are most commonly associated with Rogue.Movement is made with the arrow keys, however earlier versions used "HJKL" as the main controls. There are also single key presses for actions such as "quaff" (Q), "eat" (E), and "wield" (W). Each level contains a maximum of nine rooms, with some rooms being replaced with a dead-end corridor.The key is to balance exploration with progression, too much exploring can waste food and risk loss of health to monsters; too much focus on progression and important items may be missed.[CR]Rog-O-Matic[CR]As Rogue is based on a terminal interface, Rog-O-Matic is designed to play and win Rogue automatically, inspiring further development of bots for other games and uses.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Rolling Thunder</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rolling Thunder is an action game developed by Namco and released in Japanese arcades in 1986. In it, you play as a member of the WCPO (World Central Police Organization/&#19990;&#30028;&#21009;&#20107;&#35686;&#23519;&#27231;&#27083;) named Albatross who is trying to rescue his partner, Leila, from the evil organization bent on world domination called "GELDRA". There are a couple of minor differences between the arcade and Famicom versions of the game; these mostly revolve around the types of maskers encountered, the number of them encountered (the arcade version has a vastly greater number of enemies attacking Albatross) and the speed of their bullets (their bullets travel much faster in the famicom version, making reacting trickier at times!). The game features 10 stages.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must help Albatross make his way through various GELDRA bases in search of clues to the location of their HQ and to rescue Leila. To do so, the player guiding him will need quick reflexes. Albatross is armed with a pistol which can be shot rapidly; if the player should run out of ammo, the last bullet will regenerate over time, but this seriously impedes the player's rate of fire. Albatross is capable of touching an enemy twice before dying, or being shot/hit by a grenade/burned with flames/etc. a single time before losing a life.In many stages there are two or more "levels" (a ground floor and a catwalk of some sort) that the player can stand on; the player can switch between them by either hitting up and jump or down and jump. Sometimes there are objects (or not, as the issue is generally a lack of a hand rail) which will prevent the player from dropping down from the upper level. In addition, doors are spaced throughout all stages. These doors serve three purposes: Firstly, they are a point of entry for GELDRA agents, termed "maskers". Secondly, they are a place for Albatross to hide from the maskers. Be careful though, as if a masker sees you enter, he won't be afraid to simply stand in front of the door! Thirdly some doors are labeled "ammo" or "arms". The "arms" doors temporarily grant Albatross the ability to use a machine gun. When the ammo runs out, Albatross returns to using his normal pistol. The "ammo" doors simply contain extra ammo for Albatross' pistol. At the end of each stage, the player is treated to a cutscene of maskers watching other maskers harassing Leila via a massive monitor, either stripping her of clothing, electrocuting her, or performing some other diabolical and villainous deed.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]AlbatrossThe main protagonist. He belongs to "Rolling Thunder", a group of the best agents in the WCPO. His favourite gun is a "Walther P-38". His design is apparently loosely inspired by Lupin III. He returns in Rolling Thunder 2.LeilaA fellow member of Rolling Thunder and Albatross' partner, she was caught while on duty by GELDRA. The object of the game is to rescue her. She returns as a playable character in Rolling Thunder 2.MabooThe evil leader and founder of the GELDRA organization. He is determined to conquer the world, and doesn't even appear to be human. He is capable of firing energy projectiles from his hands.The maskersThe foot soldiers of the GELDRA organization. They come in a great variety of colors, which generally are an indicator of how they attack and react to the player. Some, termed "ninjas", are equipped with special stealth suits; others which wear goggles and have rounded hoods are generally sturdier than your basic masker.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are several stage types in Rolling Thunder; the player passes through two sets of stages termed "story 1" and "story 2", culminating in the second secret lab which is GELDRA's true headquarters.WarehouseThe first stage in both story 1 and 2 are of this variety. It is characterized by a blue background and containers.Underground passagewayResembling a cave, there are often panthers or mutant bats called gelzo found in these.GELDRA baseSecret GELDRA bases hidden around the world. These resemble labs, and are generally swarming with maskers.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In this 3D Rotoscoped landscape the player controls Rotox the robot, which is required to to eradicate any form of mechanized existence on each of the levels. Each level is comprised of nine sectors, which are not all linked together. At the beginning of each level you drop in from above and get a general overview of the level. [CR]Planning a path from sector to sector often involves using moving pathways. The sectors are heavily defended, but weapons can be picked up throughout. When a sector is cleared of robots, the screen flashes and the player is free to move on to the next sector.</plot>

			<plot>Kids TV show Round the Bend was set in a fictitious comic factory - one with amazingly even more toilet humor than the real things. In this licensed game Doc Croc has blown up the printing press, and Lou Brush must go through the sewers to retrieve all 8 pages.[CR]After selecting a section from the initial screen of pipes, gameplay involves moving through scrolling platform sections in order to reach the sheets. Once this is done each page is played out as a single-screen multi-layered screen. The specific settings are influenced by the TV show, including Doc Crocs Nursery Crimes, The False Teeth Versus the Atomic Banana, and Kenny McTickle and His Magic Kilt.</plot>

			<plot>Rather tastelessly, the plot of this one concerns a catastrophic nuclear accident in Russia. You must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which you'll have to control in order to gain the weapon you want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was released at a similar time.</plot>

			<title_clean>Rugby - The Worldcup</title_clean>
			<plot>An official licensed game of the 1991 Rugby World Cup, bringing a sport rarely seen on home computers to life. The game recreates the exact structure of the tournament, and includes all 16 teams. The gameplay has been simplified slightly, in the aim of creating a more flowing and less complicated game. As a result, scrums are frequent, penalties are absent, and a flowing running game is favoured. The teams are of different abilities, reflecting their real life skills.</plot>

			<plot>A Sabre Team is a squad of four elite soldiers charged with some of the toughest hostage-rescue, building-storming and the like that Western forces have ever attempted. In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.[CR]In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.</plot>

They can also communicate with other members of their own tribe to ask for trade and assistance, complete missions given by the tribe elder as well as fight opponents with sharpened flint (which the player must create in a carving mini-game) which are also used to hunt game animals for food.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>A simple variation of the classic game of  Mahjongg (also known as Shanghai). Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.</plot>

			<plot>Three magic scrolls must be found in the first part of the scrolling hack 'n' slash game, before you can make the journey to defeat your foes and rescue the other wizards in the second part. As with so many Dinamic games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input.[CR]Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.</plot>

			<plot>With a clear James Bond influence, Sly Spy must stop terrorists destroying parts of the city in this collection of sub-games. Roughly half of these (starting with level 2, and alternating from there on) are side-scrolling Green Beret-influenced offerings, not entirely dissimilar to a great many Ocean movie licenses. There are bad guys to shoot and bullets to avoid, with boxes to climb up on and strategic positions to shoot from behind cover.The first level involves skydiving down the screen and shooting at the agents as they themselves fall - complete this and you'll safely parachute to the ground. There's a motorbike chase, in which you must shoot out and dodge agents. Two underwater levels follow, in which more enemies and some sharks must be shot. Before reaching the final multiple-enemy showdown in a missile factory full of the baddies from the game.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Guybrush Threepwood, a young man with desires to become a mighty pirate, travels to Melee Island, a pirate haven. Upon arrival he meets three " important looking pirates" in the SCUMM Bar who set him three challenges to test his worthiness. These entail defeating the legendary insult sword fighting master Carla, finding buried treasure and stealing a statue from the governors mansion. During a botched break-in to the mansion he meets and subsequently falls in love with the governor Elaine Marley. Elsewhere the ghost pirate LeChuck is seen pining after the love of his life, the same Elaine Marley, and hatches a plan to capture her. While Guybrush is busy finishing the trials LeChuck and his ghost pirate crew abduct her and take her to Monkey Island. Upon completing the trials Guybrush discovers this revelation, purchases a ship from Stan, a used ship salesman who informs him the ship requires a crew of four people. After gathering Carla, the sword fighting Master he had previously defeated, Meathook, a pirate with two hooks replacing his hands, and Otis a prisoner in Melee Island's Prison Guybrush and crew set sail in pursuit to rescue her.Upon setting sail Guybrush's crew mutinied against him, and decided to sunbathe instead. After following the instructions on his map to get to Monkey Island, he shoots himself onto the island.;Arriving at Monkey Island he discovers a strange band of cannibals and a hermit named Herman Toothrot. After helping the cannibals recover a lost voodoo ingredient they provide him with a recipe to destroy ghosts. When attempting to confront LeChuck however he finds only a single crewman who informs him of LeChuck's intention to marry Elaine on Melee Island. He sets sail once more.Returning to Melee Island he arrives at the church with intent to prevent the marriage but finds Elaine had her own plan of escape. LeChuck attacks Guybrush and after lengthy exchange the two arrive at the ship emporium whereupon Guybrush sprays LeChuck with root beer, the cannibals ghost fighting elixir being made from voodoo root. With LeChuck demise Guybrush and Elaine share a romantic moment, watching fireworks.[CR]Development[CR]Developed by Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, The Secret of Monkey Island began production shortly after Gilbert finished work on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The pirate premise of the game was inspired by Gilbert's love of The Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland. His desire was to create a lush and fanciful world fill with swashbuckling pirates much like those seen in classic film and literature.The team's desire was to create a more accessible adventure game that anyone at any skill level could enjoy. Until then the genre had been known for being filled with difficult and often esoteric puzzles and full of trial and error gameplay. Gilbert and company hoped to avoid this by offering non linear puzzle sections such as The Three Trials where the player is free to work on a second puzzle if another becomes too difficult. The series also set the precedent in Lucasarts adventures of never allowing the player to die.Just before the game was set to ship, the company responsible for boxing the games and shipping to retailers told Lucasarts that they could not fill the order in time due to need to give their workers time off. This prompted nearly all of the Lucasarts staff to, themselves, box and ship all of the initial copies of The Secret of Monkey Island. Gilbert has said that during this time he, Grossman and Schafer each signed a one dollar bill and slipped it into one of the boxes. It's unknown if anyone ever found it.[CR]Insult Sword Fighting[CR]When sword fighting, it's not enough to have the right technique, you must also be able to parry an opponent's insults with appropriately witty responses. For example; the correct response to "You fight like a dairy farmer!" would be "How appropriate, you fight like a cow!". If the fighter responds with the correct come back, he earns the right to dish out the next insult. The first to three insults wins the fight.[CR]In-Jokes[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island is filled with references to Loom, another Lucasarts game released around the same time. Early in the game Guybrush encounters Cobb, a character from Loom who wears an "Ask me about Loom" button, who's only response to Guybush's attempts at conversation are "Aye". That is, however, until Guybrush asks him about Loom. Cobb then launches into full advertisement on the games excellent story and wonderful soundtrack. Other references to Loom include a seagull from them game and the line "I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?" after Guybrush is fired from a cannon.The game also takes a shot at fellow developer Sierra. At one point in the game the player can make Guybrush fall off a mountain resulting in a game over screen similar to those found in Sierra's adventure games that says "Oh, no! You've really screwed up this time! Guess you'll have to start over! Hope you saved the game!". After a few moments Guybrush flys back up the mountain and the game continues as normal.[CR]Easter Eggs[CR]When the ' Important Looking Pirates' in the Scumm Bar ask Guybrush if he has any special skills, one dialogue option is to tell them that he can hold his breath for 10 minutes. Later, when Fester Shinetop throws you into the water, if you wait 10 minutes you'll see Guybrush drown, bloat up, and a load is required.The Special Edition also includes a few references to past Lucas-Arts titles:In the cave where Le Chuck's vessel is anchored you'll see the face of Manny Calavera, the protogonist of Grim Fandango, hidden in one of the skull-filled speleothems.At the Giant Monkey Head there's an idol statue of The Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition[CR]Special Edition Box ArtOn July 15, 2009, an updated "Special Edition" version of The Secret of Monkey Island was released on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and iPhone/iPod touch (the game was later released on the PlayStation Network on April 22, 2010). This re-imagining has remained completely faithful to the original game, featuring updated 1080i graphics, new music, hand drawn recreations of all the characters, items, &amp; backgrounds, as well as full voice overs using the voice cast from The Curse of Monkey Island.The game has been given a streamlined interface designed to work better with a console controller. Players also have the ability to switch between the original version of the game and the special edition at any time with one button so that those who prefer the old style can still enjoy the experience. Moreover this version includes a built-in hint system for those who need it, which has three varying levels, but is a completely optional feature to use.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]OriginalMS-DOS 5.0 or higher1 Mb of EMS required (2 Mb recommended)386/33 DX (486 DX recommended)Sounblaster and 100% compatibles, Adlib, Roland MT 32Special EditionWindows XP or VistaProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3000Memory: 256 MB RAM, 512 MB for VistaGraphics: 128 MB with Shader Model 2.0 capabilityDirectX: 9.0c (March 2009)Hard Drive: 2.5GB free hard drive spaceSound: DirectX 9.0c compliant sound card[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>The Sentinel</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Sentinel is a computer game originally developed for the BBC Micro in 1986 by Geoff Crammond. It was later ported to other 8-bit computers like the Commodore 64 (Crammond himself handled the conversion), Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum as well as 16-bit computers like the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga and IBM PC.It's best known as one of the first games to use polygonal graphics, which -- due to the unique nature of the game's controls, in that the player is always stationary -- didn't require an absurd amount of computing power (at the time) to render. It still ran a lot more slowly on 8-bit systems than on 16-bit systems, however, though fans were known to boost the computing power of older systems to be able to play it more effectively.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The surreal premise of the game is explained minimally: The player controls a consciousness that inhabits an immobile vessel called a Synthoid, which can look around the multi-tiered 3D chequerboard world, but can't move. What it can do is absorb and create objects (which gains and spends energy respectively) that is on a square that it can see the entirety of (that is, it can't absorb or create anything on a square above its line of sight) or on one of the platforms it has created, known as "Boulders". The player can also create more Synthoids, and can instantaneously transfer their consciousness to them, at which time it will be facing its now unused Synthoid (which it will most likely absorb along with whatever else the fresh Synthoid can see from the new vantage).The player's goal is to transfer itself into the eponymous Sentinel at the highest point on each map where it can then Hyperspace to a new level. The Sentinel is systematically turning in place and scanning its field of view for anything with more than 1 point of energy (everything except Trees) -- it absorbs any such object once found and redistributes the energy as Trees around the level. This includes the player's Synthoid, which means avoiding the Sentinel's gaze is a top priority.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Sex Olympics is one of a very few adult-oriented computer game attempts of its era, marking fictitious sci-fi porn star Brad Stallion's final huzzah.  This adventure game has a mouse-driven interface that allows players to click on objects in order to solve puzzles, including the use of some, ahem, specialised actions not commonly found in adventure games[CR]The game takes place in a (sadly) fictional universe where the player controls dashing hero Brad Stallion, in competition with arch-enemy Dr. Dildo in the interplanetary Sex Olympics. The goal of this futuristic sporting event is to seduce women (well, nubile females of various species) from different planets faster than the lothario Dr. Dildo does. This is achieved either by seducing them through old-fashioned questing and the solution of adventure-game puzzles or by thwarting the good doctor from obtaining certain items he needs in order to keep his groove on.  Faster, higher, stronger!</plot>

			<plot>Seymour goes to Hollywood to star in his first motion picture. As he arrives in his limousine, he soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start production of his film by himself.[CR]Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.</plot>

			<title_clean>Shadow Dancer</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadow Dancer is an Arcade side-scrolling action game and the sequel to Shinobi. There are actually two versions of this game: The Arcade game and its home conversions, for computers like the Atari ST and Amiga as well as the Sega Master System, and Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi for the Sega Genesis, which significantly changed a lot of aspects about the game.Taking place 20 years after the original Shinobi, It features the terrorist group "Asian Down" planting bombs throughout Miami and killing Hayate Musashi's friend Kato. This is a means to distract Hayate from their real intentions: using the top secret U.S. Government initiative "Space Shuttle Olympia", (which they have already found out about and captured) to control a nuclear satellite attack system. This forces Hayate and his (then unnamed) canine companion to spring into action by disarming the bombs, returning government property, and generally kicking ass in his own personal War on Terrorism. Also as a series first, the last boss/primary antagonist (and Head of Operations over at Asian Down) is female.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is very similar to that of the Shinobi games except now the player has the addition of a dog for a game mechanic. The dog is able to harass enemies, some of which are very difficult to kill otherwise. When the dog is hurt, it shrinks into a puppy and is unable to do any attacking until the next power-up is found. In the Arcade version, the shinobi dog can only initiate an attack if the player is crouching and the dog is barking.Throughout each stage in the game there are a number of bombs that must be disarmed before they Hayate can face the boss. The ninja's main weapon is an unlimited supply of throwing stars combined with punches and kicks when he gets close to enemies. Ninja Magic can also be performed once each level which will kill all enemies on screen, or in the case of a boss deal severe damage. A single power-up also exists which upgrades the throwing stars into energy bolts and allows the ninja to perform more powerful sword slashes.The game contains 4 rounds which are divided into subsections totaling 15 stages. Every round has only 1 regular stage and 1 boss stage. This differed slightly on the Sega Master System port of the game which was the shortest of all the versions. The Arcade version saw Hayate go up against a group of ninjas climbing down a building in the style of a first-person shooter. The Master System contains both the Arcade and the Sega Genesis versions of the bonus round.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.[CR]As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.[CR]Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadoworlds is an isometric real-time sci-fi RPG that was released in 1992 for the Atari ST and Amiga home computers. It was developed by UK company Krisalis Software (sometimes referred to by their previous name, Teque Interactive). It is the follow up to Shadowlands, which featured a medieval fantasy setting instead.The game is best remembered for its dynamic lighting effects. Called "photoscaping" at the time, various sources of light will project a pre-determined radius of illumination around them. These include glowing projectiles from laser beams and flamethrowers as well as the space station's own failing light systems and spacesuit lamps belonging to individual characters. These lighting effects are calculated on the fly.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shadoworlds features a four-person team of pre-generated characters that the player puts together before starting the game: they feature various cyborgs and augmented humans and the game had a distinctive anime-like theme to its character art. The player can split this party up and send them off to complete tasks in different parts of the ship, but the game stays real-time throughout and characters left alone will potentially be in danger.The player can use darkness to their advantage to stay hidden from enemies, but they'll also need to use lights to examine or manipulate items in the environment. At any time, a character can activate the lamp inside their spacesuits for some illumination, but they'll need extra batteries to keep it on for an extended period. The team can find weapons and use them on the various hostile robots on the space station, though almost all of them require power to work: they can be recharged in various spots on the space station.

			<plot>The Kruwehl family is surrounded by mystery, not the least of which is the fact that each member of the clan seems to have died in an unnatural way. Furthermore, whoever has tried to find out the secret of the odd, but influential, family has died in the process. Now, as an investigative reporter who has been a little to investigative, it is your turn to die. Attempting to thwart destiny, you enter the Agony manor while its owner is away for the night, attempting to unravel the Kruwehl family's mystery.Sheer Agony is a graphical adventure made up of digitised stills, with limited mouse interaction. There are 15 point-and-click verbs at your disposal: go, open, close, look, probe, read, swallow, smell, press, turn, push, lift, search, take and put. Using search, you can find objects and pick them up, but your inventory is limited to 9 items, after which you must put down held items in the right spot, or relinquish them forever. The number of items per screen is small, but the manor is quite large and you must use the integrated map to find your way through each floor.Originally released in French, English and German for the Atari Falcon, Sheer Agony was also re-released in a cut-down version for common Atari ST computers.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shinobi is a side-scrolling action game from Sega that was originally released in Arcades and ported to the Master System. It would later make its way onto a number of other systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System. Shinobi saw multiple sequels for both the Arcade and for various Sega consoles.Joe Musashi is a master ninja sent on a mission to release hostages and defeat a powerful opponent in each region across the city. There is one hostage per level guarded by a large guard with a shield which can either be killed or circumvented. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Excuse me...While playing through the main levels Joe is able to pick up different power-ups which include ninja magic, health or extra lives. The ninja magic can be used to add different abilities to the protagonist such as ninja stars or flame strikes. A health bar is present at the top of the screen and will grow with power-ups. Each level is designed with increasing difficulty and while there may be no save option in the original Arcade version once a hostage is rescued they stay rescued. The player will only have to power through the regular enemies while making their way back to the point of death. Power-ups will not respawn.There are mini-games between the 5 missions and 19 rounds which have the camera looking from Joe's eyes in the first person. These mini-games have the player shooting ninja stars at anything from targets to flying ninjas who have some ninja stars of their own.[CR]Graphics[CR]The Two-Mega cartridge used for Shinobi was unable to handle the full animations from the arcade version, but most of the sprites were kept the same. The color count in each system was slightly different, the NES version being the lowest and the Arcade being the highest.[CR]Audio[CR]Different versions were again limited by their cartridge capacity and console. The SMS version used BGM_A music, boss music and bonus round music. The arcade was the only edition to use digital voice, all others used analog sound effects instead.[CR]</plot>

Does not appear in the tournament mode.Skip Feeney: A nerdy human who is also new to the game. First opponent in tournament mode.Visine Orb: A small, nervous creature that quickly moves its paddle around but doesn't do much to block the player's shots.Vinnie The Dweeb: An easy-going and languid player that is slow to react. Looks like a giant humanoid sloth.Lexan Smythe-Worthington: An aristocratic alien who is always seen with a drink in his hand. Starts strong but constantly sips his martini throughout the match, making him less and less effective.Eneg Doowtrop: Also known as The General, this military pig alien is aggressive with his returns but can leave gaps in his defense.Nerual Ttoille: A mysterious alien that copies the player's every move, making him hard to overcome.Princess Bejin: A mysterious robed woman who occasionally cheats by using her psychic powers to move the puck.Biff Raunch: A burly biker type who is extremely competent at the game. Has no weaknesses. Presents the game's hardest challenge. The player also has the ability to adjust the bounce and power of the paddle in the options menu.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Shuttle - The Space Flight Simulator</title_clean>
			<plot>An old, but very realistic space shuttle simulator. The package contains, in addition to two game disks, a very thick manual and a large sheet (A2 size, maybe) displaying the cockpit instruments of the shuttle. To successfully fly the missions, the player must learn a great number of dials and how to use every single instrument, located in nine different cockpit panels. The controls can be used with mouse, but keyboard shortcuts are essential for quick operation. In addition to cockpit views, there are various external views, from which you can see the shuttle e.g. in launch pad and in orbit. If you do not use time advance or time skip options during the game, playing one mission can last for days. Going through the proper pre-launch countdown takes five hours, for example.</plot>

			<plot>Originating in the arcades, Side Arms is a horizontally scrolling shoot &#8216;em up in which you control Lieutenant Henry (a second player can control Sergeant Sanders in some versions), armed with crude weaponry and protective jump-suits. They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon&#8217;s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An example of a city.SimCity is a city-building simulation game released in 1989 and designed by eventual Sims creator Will Wright. SimCity, being Maxis' first game and originally based on the Commodore 64, has been adapted to several different personal computers and game consoles and has gone on to become one of the most successful and popular games of all time.Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the entire SimCity franchise was the most successful gaming franchise Maxis had created. Due to the immense popularity of SimCity, Maxis went on to create a multitude of other, similar simulation games, including SimTown and SimAnt., though none of these franchises has ever met the success of SimCity.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sandbox vs. ScenarioAs would later to go on to define games of the SimCity franchise, the game first opens with the option of either building a city from the ground up (Sandbox) or running a city that is currently facing some issue or crisis (Scenario). In Sandbox mode, players choose a city site by choosing from a large list of premade maps and then giving a name to their city. Additionally, the Sandbox mode has no predefined goal or metric for "winning" the game, so players are free to run their cities as they see fit. Conversely, Scenarios have clearly defined metrics for winning (ex. double population in X years) and can be "lost".[CR]Versions[CR]SimCity was developed for a wide range of platforms and has seen multiple re-releases, each with their own changes and additions.iPhoneAn iPhone version of SimCity is available now, but it isn't this version of the game. The iPhone version is a remake of Simcity 3000, with some added features (such as better advisers).SNESThe Super Nintendo version exhibited changes made by Nintendo, such as the addition of Bowser, and the character "Dr. Wright" who guides the player.SimCity EnhancedWhile the game play remained identical to the original PC release the CD-Rom enhanced edition featured Live Actors, Digitized Voice and Sound, and  Full Motion Video.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Bart wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a UFO. He is the only one that knows about the alien invasion. Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of "Maggie", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the "spin the wheel" minigame.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Level oneLocation: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: MaggieLevel twoLocation: Shopping MallBoss: Ms. BotzHelper: MargeLevel threeLocation: CarnivalBoss: Sideshow BobHelper: LisaLevel fourLocation: MuseumSub-Boss: TyrannosaurusBoss: Dr. MonroeHelper: HomerLevel fiveLocation: Power PlantHelper: Maggie, Marge, Lisa, and HomerNo Boss[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The story takes place after Bart wins a trip around the world on the show of Krusty the Clown. Mr. Smithers rigged the contest for Mr. Burns to get rid of his "worst enemies" the Simpsons. Burns hopes to do this by sending many agents to the different places where Bart will go (4 places in all: China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood) where Bart has to survive the different attacks from the evil duo's agents.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,6,7 and 7 out of ten. Sushi-X, who gave a 7 wrote, "This cart is a big improvement over previous Simpsons' titles for the Game Gear. The graphics are excellent and are very bright and colorful. The sounds are really good too. There is a lot more variety to the game play and the control is very responsive. Of course the humor of Bart and his wacky friends is rampant throughout the game. Overall this is another quality Game Gear cart and Simpsons' fans should take note".[CR]</plot>

Unfortunately, the system malfunctioned and began generating real weapons and tanks to attack the outside world.[CR]You are the man charged with putting a stop to all of this. In your ground-skimming SRV, remove the power lines that keep Simulcra functional. Shoot out each of the energy projectors which block your path to clear each of the 30 matrices.[CR]The action is viewed from immediately behind you, showing a world of pathways and gaps which rotate as you move your craft, which can also reverse. You will have to fight off guns, planes and everything else the embattled system can throw at you. Destroying these releases pods which give extras such as improved weaponry and extra energy when collected. A full map of the area is provided.</plot>

			<plot>Skate Ball is a futuristic sports game in which two teams try to score goals by putting a puck into the opponent's goal. Just like ice hockey, the team members skate on ice and use a hockey stick. However, the active team only consists of two members: a field athlete and a goalkeeper. The player controls the field athlete and tries to score goals or tackling the enemy when in defense.As with many futuristic sports games, a match can be hazardous to the athletes. Not only are rude actions like flying kicks allowed, but the playing field is filled with obstacles like pits or disintegrators. Stepping on those causes the athlete to die and the need to use one of the two substitute athletes. Those have different stats (strength, reaction, shooting and balance) which influence the match - if there are enough alive, the player can choose the used athlete at the start of the match. The scrolling screen keeps on the puck and a radar helps to navigate the obstacles off-screen.</plot>

			<plot>The game represents Ski-Doo, a 6-month length trek set in the snowy woods of North Eastern Canada. Riding  snow scooters, participants try to survive in this white desert, hunting for the wild animals and finding warm places following the routes to the cities. Visiting 25 cities along the way, 10 contestants take part in a wild race on ice-circuit to win money. You are one  such participant, and you should survive and come to the finish of the overall trek in the first place.[CR]This single-player game is shown in a 3rd-person view, while you are controlling your driver, riding a snow scooter, to accelerate/decelerate and turn left/right. As time goes, night will fall after the day and so on. At the same time  food and heat levels will decrease, so you should always  need to raise them up. The view will be switched to 1-st person, while you are hunting for animals to increase food level.</plot>

			<plot>In Skidz, the player moves through the five levels with the goal to collect and dispose of all litter lying around. To be more exact, 75% of the litter has to be collected and put into dust bags on the way to get access to the next level. However, not all litter is in easy to reach positions and has to be collected with tricky jumps. The controls work in a way that the player builds up the speed by pressing a button or pulling the joystick in a direction. If high speed is reached, another press of the button results in a jump. The protagonist has a certain amount of health which decreases when he rams against the environment or citizens (some of them actively try to hurt the protagonist), drives over broken bottles or misses a jump. Power ups include health refreshments, bonus time for the time limit and coins which are used to buy useful equipment between levels. Bonus points can be earned by performing stunts while jumping, but failing results in a crash. The player chooses between a skateboard or a bike, but this makes no significant difference in gameplay.Additionally to the regular playing mode, there is also a race to participate in. It involves one opponent and various obstacles which need to be jumped over</plot>

But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...[CR]The game represents a Barbarian clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.[CR]The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.</plot>

			<title_clean>Smash TV</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Smash TV is Eugene Jarvis' spiritual successor to Robotron: 2084, an early Arcade game that is one of the first examples of the twin stick control method. Smash TV retains this same gameplay, using the left joystick to move and the right to shoot, allowing a player to move in one direction while firing in another.Evil M.C.The year is 1999. A new game show called Smash TV was created which puts its contenders to the fight for their lives. They will have to kill hundreds of enemies and collect money and prizes (from toasters to a big-screen TV). The inspiration for Smash TV seems to be the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, The Running Man. Two players can play simultaneously, and at the end of each of the three levels, the two players' performance is compared, with one being declared the winner.Each level ends with a boss battle. The first level pits the players against Mutoid Man. The second boss is a giant, round face named Scarface. The third level seemingly ends with a fight against two large, robotic snake heads called Die Cobros. But this is immediately followed by the game's true boss, the game show host himself called Evil M.C. This battle is essentially a tougher version of the Mutoid Man boss fight.[CR]Home Versions[CR]Super Smash TV for the SNES After its success in coin-operated form, Smash TV was brought to the home market on many different console and computer platforms. Home game consoles of the era were not equipped with multi-joystick controllers; alternative control schemes were implemented to approximate the controls of the arcade original. While some versions use buttons to fire in a direction, or to toggle a direction, others use multiple controllers' joysticks. Acclaim's SNES version of the game, Super Smash TV (referred to by its original name within the game), used the D-pad and face buttons to duplicate the two joysticks of the original. The SNES version also contains additional secret rooms.The Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is an emulation of the original arcade release, controls with its two joysticks. It is also the only version to include online play, letting two players play the game over the Internet.This game is featured on Midway Arcade Treasures for the Gamecube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC.[CR][B]Achievements:[/B][CR]Due to a glitch in the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, 360 users are unable to obtain the full 200 achievement points available in the game. The Game Master Achievement (in theory obtained by beating the game without continuing on default systems) does not unlock, denying gamers the game's final 50 points. The publishers have acknowledged the problem, but there are currently no plans to fix the issue.[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]Though Smash TV never received a proper sequel, many of the same people responsible for the game went on to produce Total Carnage, a game that maintained the same control style and applied it to a vertical scrolling world, similar to Ikari Warriors or Mercs. There are plenty of references to Smash TV in Total Carnage.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Solomon's Key, the wizard Dana adventures through 48 action-puzzle levels (and 15 "secret" levels), searching for items and avoiding danger. Dana uses his magic wand to strategically create or destroy stone blocks, in search of each level's key and exit door. Various monsters block Dana's progress, which he can avoid, trap with blocks, or fight with fire spells.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The level design becomes increasingly devious as it progresses and often makes it possible for the player to trap themselves, making it impossible to finish the level. Other levels require precise timing to reach the key and the level's door, while enemies become more frequent and aggressive. Players start with three lives, but can continue by holding UP and pressing A + B from the "Game Deviation Value" screen. Once players move beyond level 40, continues return them there. Finishing the game means completing levels 40 through 50 with only 3 lives, a very challenging feat.[CR][B]Abilities:[/B][CR]A typical Solomon's Key level.Players can do three things to help Dana move through each level, search for the key, and avoid danger.Create and destroy orange blocks in adjacent spaces, including blocks diagonally above or below.Break overhead blocks by jumping into them twice with his head.Shoot fireballs at enemies after retrieving red potions that are scattered throughout the levels.While movement seems simple at first, the game makes use of its limited mechanics to create ever more difficult puzzles that call for precise jumping and block creation. Players who can place blocks in mid-jump (creating a block below Dana while in mid-air) will find the game's hardest puzzles more navigable.[CR]Hidden Items and Game Endings[CR]Game levels organize around the Zodiac's 12 houses, with 4 rooms per sign. Level 1 to 4 is Aries, 5 to 8 is Taurus, and so on, through Pisces at 45-48. When players pick up the constellation tile in the last room of each group (level 4, 8, 12, etc.), they enter hidden levels that contain spells and special items. While Solomon's Key ends after level 48 (or the Fairy room, details below), players can earn better endings by collecting Seals of Solomon and these special items.Worst ending: failed to collect Seals of Solomon.Better ending: collect five Seals (rooms 9, 13, 17, 21, 29), Page of Time (hidden room after 20), and Page of Space (hidden room after 44)Best ending: collect seven Seals (rooms 9, 13, 17, 21, 29, 46, 47), Page of Time, Page of Space, and save Fairy Princess (hidden room after 48)[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.[CR]The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.[CR]Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.[CR]The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</plot>

			<title_clean>Space Crusade</title_clean>
			<plot>Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. [CR]The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Crusade is a sci-fi strategy game based on the board game made by Milton Bradly that shares the same name. The game also shares similar mechanics to those found in HeroQuest. Up to three players control a team consisting of a commander and four space marines. Each level - set in floating "space hulks" - has a story and a set of mission objectives that require completing, often involving destroying a certain enemy unit or procuring an item. As in Gremlin's earlier game HeroQuest, Space Crusade also uses a turn-based system and determines to-hit and damage rolls via dice - white for light weapons, red for heavy weapons.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Space Harrier</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!"Space Harrier (&#12473;&#12506;&#12540;&#12473;&#12495;&#12522;&#12450;&#12540; Sup&#275;su Hari&#257;) is a third-person rail shooter game. It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The bonus stage.The game takes place in a unique place called the "Fantasy Zone" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 5,000,000 points.The arcade version.The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can.StagesThe third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: Absymbel[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the "rolling" cabinet. The "rolling" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012.[CR]Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware[CR]The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles.Technical specificationsCPU (Central Processing Unit) mother boardMain CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MBSuper Scaler GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) boardGPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was ported to several Sega consoles, such as the Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as "Sega Ages: Space Harrier" is also a pretty faithful version of the game. This version of the game also appeared in the US with two other games on a compilation disc simply called Sega Ages.The two Master System versions, including Space Harrier 3-D, reduced the graphical quality and speed quite a bit, but still managed to be a recognizable port of the original game. The first Master System version, released in 1986, was the first home video game cartridge to feature 2 Megabits (256 Kilobytes) of memory. The second Master System version, Space Harrier 3-D, featured the use of stereoscopic 3D graphics. The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as "Haya Oh." This new boss fight also appears in the X68000 version of the game. The Game Gear version of the game shares some of the basic quality issues as the Master System release, but contains different levels, an adjusted resolution, and a password system for continuing from later levels.Space Harrier, featured in Shenmue.The game was also featured in the game Shenmue. Space Harrier was located in the "You Arcade" building in the Dobuita area of the game; the player has to pay one-hundred yen to play the game. The "Sega Saturn" version of Space Harrier was also featured as a prize in the raffle in some of the convenience stores. The Sega Saturn version can be played on Ryo's Sega Saturn that is located in his living room.A polygonal remake of the game was made as part of Sega's Sega Ages series in Japan. The polygonal version of Space Harrier was released outside of Japan in the form of Sega Classics Collection.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Arcade versionThe arcade game was well received upon release. It became one of 1986's chart hits in the arcades. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the arcade game in its March 1986 issue, after reviewer Clare Edgeley played it at the 1986 ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in London, along with the arcade version of Super Mario Bros. She stated, "Perhaps the games to steal the show were" Space Harrier along with Shrike Avenger (1986), praising their hydraulic cockpit cabinets that "twist, turn and move" in the same direction as the joystick, making them "the most realistic" simulators "to date". She praised Space Harrier's "excellent graphics" for being "all in 3D with amazing technicolour landscapes" and a "multitude of objects" on screen, as well as "the sounds of the battle" output by "large speakers" where "you could almost lose touch with reality". She also praised the gameplay for being "exciting" and "very fast" paced, as well as the continue feature, but stated the game can be "very difficult."Clare Edgeley gave the arcade game a retrospective review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where she noted it had one of the first hydraulic arcade cabinets she had seen, along with 1986's Shrike Avenger. She stated that Space Harrier's "fabulously colourful 3D graphics" and "the movement of the sit-in cabinet were, and still are, breathtaking", noting "the seat-belt" and "turbulent" ride which "hurls you up, down, left and right" and tilts "the cabinet in a roll in whatever direction you push your joystick", concluding the game to be "great fun."Home conversionsReview scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games70% (C64)68% (ZX)40% (CPC)[3]CRASH77% (ZX)Famitsu34/40 (3DS)Sinclair User (ZX)Your Sinclair9/10 (ZX)The Milwaukee Journal9/10 (SMS)AwardsEntityAwardGolden Joystick AwardsGame of the Year (Runner&#8209;Up)The home conversions were also well received. The game was runner-up in the category of Game of the Year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards.The Milwaukee Journal in May 1987 gave the Master System version a positive review, rating it a score of 9 out of 10. The reviewer Edward J. Semrad described the Master System version of Space Harrier as "the latest innovation" and "the most powerful cartridge ever made for any computer or game system." He concluded it "sets new standards in audio, graphic detail, memory and price ($40 list)."The September 1988 issue of Computer Gaming World (page 50) called Space Harrier "the best arcade shoot-'em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played".[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The flying furry creature in the bonus stages is very similar to Falkor, the flying dog-dragon from the 1984 film, The NeverEnding Story.The game was originally supposed to be set in a real world military setting as players controlled a Harrier jet fighter. Due to the technical limitation at the offset of development of not having enough memory for all the intended graphics the decision was made to switch the game to a science fiction setting. The game however did retain the "Harrier" portion of its name though. [CR]</plot>

Modern features better graphics and some extra features.Move your base at the bottom of the screen and kill as many aliens as possible. Aliens will move across the screen in a formation of 10 x 5 and for each switch of direction the will close in a bit on the player. The more aliens the player kills the faster the remaining aliens will move. Now and then a mothership will appear at the top och the game area. Destroying it will give the player some extra points, in modern mode destroying a mother ship will on later levels reward the player with better defences and fast shooting missiles.The game was written in assembler.</plot>

			<title_clean>Space Quest - The Sarien Encounter</title_clean>
			<plot>Title ScreenSpace Quest: The Sarien Encounter was an early text command adventure game developed by Sierra, and was very similar to King's Quest. Space Quest took a more humorous approach to the adventure genre than the more serious King's Quest series. Most of the settings and characters were outright parodies of famous science fiction franchises like Star Wars, Star Trek, and Alien. The Sarien Encounter was the first in the Space Quest series, which would eventually have six installments. It also introduced the character of Roger Wilco, a bumbling janitor from the planet Xenon who somehow keeps managing to save the galaxy. The Sarien Encounter would see a remake in 1991, which featured improved graphics and a more user-friendly point-and-click interface for the gameplay.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Space Lab ArcadaAs the game begins, the scientific spaceship Arcada is attacked by the Sariens, who are after the experimental Star Generator. Roger Wilco is napping in a broom closet during the attack, and emerges to find the ship overrun and his crew mates slaughtered. The Star Generator has been stolen from the Arcada, and the ship is heading for destruction. Roger manages to get to an escape pod and crash onto to surface of the planet of Kerona.Underground CaveKerona is a desert wasteland, and Roger has to make it across the sandy wastes to find protection. Beasts lie beneath the sand waiting for passerby to devour, so Roger can only go so far. He instead must navigate a series of tunnels filled with deadly traps and creatures. Other hazards include a Sarien spider droid sent to terminate him and a violent beast known as Orat. A holographic image tasks Roger with the job of killing Orat. Players have a few options to carry out this mission: they can lure the Spider Droid into Orat's cave where they destroy each other; or they can also hide behind some rocks that Orat can't navigate past and toss a fire extinguisher at Orat, who explodes when he eats the object. Regardless of the method used to kill Orat, Roger takes a piece of Orat. The Orat piece is exchanged for a skimmer that Roger uses to get past the sand worm creatures and reach the town of Ulence Flats.Ulence Flats, KeronaWhen Roger reaches Ulence Flats, he sells the skimmer for 30 buckazoids and a jetpack. Ulenece Flats happens to have a used starship lot, but Roger doesn't have near enough cash for a ship or a navigation droid. The only source of income is the slot machine located in the town's bar. The problem with the slot machine is that three skulls will result in Roger's disintegration. Roger somehow manages to survive long enough to clean the machine out, which gives him enough cash to get off the planet. While in the bar, he overhears the coordinates of the Deltaur, the same ship that destroyed the Arcadia. Roger buys himself an appropriate ship and droid, and takes off in pursuit of the Sariens.Boarding the DeltaurThe ship arrives at the Deltaur, and Roger uses his jetpack to reach the ship and break inside. He arrives inside a laundry room, with Sariens approaching. He hides inside the washing machine, gets put on the spin cycle, and somehow comes out inside a Sarien uniform. The disguise allows Roger to acquire some weapons, which come in handy because he trips getting out of an elevator and loses his helmet. Roger battles his way through the Deltaur until he comes across the Star Generator. The Sariens have installed it into their ship and plan to use its power against Xenon. Roger enters a self-destruct code and escapes from the ship in time to see the Deltaur explode. The people of Xenon celebrate and award Roger a golden mop in gratitude.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]ZZ Top?Space Quest was a text-based adventure with a graphical presentation. Players guided Roger around the world with the arrow keys, but had to type in commands to interact with the world. These commands were used to look around, gather objects, talk to characters, etc. Items were collected and then used later to solve the puzzles and obstacles presented to the player. Quick thinking and typing were often needed to survive. It was helpful to occasionally enter commands prior to needing them and then recall said command with the F3 key. One such situation was when players had to blast their way past the Sariens in the Deltaur. The section with the skimmer also required that the player navigate the desert landscape while avoiding rocks that would cause the skimmer to explode. The slot machine sequence also served as a diversion from the main gameplay, as players had to rely on luck and save often in case of disintegration.   [CR]Misc[CR] Besides the manual and a couple of advertising booklets on Siera and AOL products the Space Quest I box also came with two coupons that referenced occurances in the game.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The ace janitor Roger Wilco thought he'd seen the last of Sludge Vohaul. However, like every evil scientist is supposed to, Vohaul returns with an even meaner scheme. This time he intends to infest the planet Xenon with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door life insurance salesmen. The last thing he wants is Roger messing things up, and so the brave janitor is captured and brought to the planet Labion to spend the rest of his days working in Vohaul's mines. Fortunately, the shuttle that takes him to the mines crashes, and Roger is the only survivor. He will have to survive the dangers of the jungle planet Labion, and eventually stop Vohaul from executing his mad plan.Vohaul's Revenge is the sequel to The Sarien Encounter, and the second game in Sierra's humorous Space Quest series of adventure games. The player navigates Roger Wilco around with arrow keys, and interacts with the world by typing commands. Like in the previous game, there are many ways for the player character to die. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to avoiding the many traps and hazards Roger will meet on his way. Some actions must be performed quickly in order to prevent Roger from getting killed.</plot>

			<title_clean>Space Quest III - The Pirates of Pestulon</title_clean>
			<plot>Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon is a 1989 adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line. It is widely regarded as the best game in the Space Quest series, and was selected as the 1989 Adventure Game of the Year by the Software Publishers of America.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] This time, Roger *is* the trash.When we last left Roger, he was floating through space in a cryogenic sleep chamber, hoping to get rescued. Rescue does come, but unfortunately in the form of a interstellar garbage hauler. Seen as just a piece of space debris, Roger and his ship are sucked up to be disposed of. Fortunately for Roger, this manages to activate his chamber's awakening function and he is able to make his escape.  Pay me if you want to live.Through Roger's weird luck, his escape finds him at the helm of a new ship, the Aluminum Mallard, which he decides to take on a tour of his current star system. Stopping at a nearby planet, Phleebhut, Roger makes his way to a local tourist destination. After perusing the knick knacks and while on his way back to his ship, Roger encounters the Annihilator droid, Arnoid the Terminator. Arnoid is there to collect an unpaid debt in Roger's name from the Labion Terror Beast Whistle he purchased from the Gippazoid Novelty Company's mail order catalogue back in SQ2. Unfortunately Roger doesn't have the money so Arnoid is forced to terminate him.  Monolith BurgerThrough his sheer prowess, or perhaps dumb luck, Roger manages to defeat the droid and quickly leaves the planet. Shaken, and a bit hungry, Roger stops off at a Monolith Burger for a quick bite. After ordering the fun meal and obtaining a nifty decoder ring as the prize, Roger decides to play the new Astro Chicken Arcade Game from ScumSoft. Being pretty good at video games, Roger manages to obtain the high score and also unlocks a mysteriously coded message. Using his new decoder ring Roger discovers that the makers of the game, and the Space Quest series, are being held captive by ScumSoft and forced to write computer games.   Preparing for a robot duel Being the noble hero that he is, Roger sets off to free the Two Guys from Andromeda. Again, through his incredible skill, or perhaps just even more blind dumb luck, Roger sneaks his way into ScumSoft and frees the two guys. Unfortunately he finds himself trapped by the evil CEO who forces Roger to face him in a life size Rock 'Em Sock 'Em duel.   Wilco, Two Guys, and WilliamsYet again, Roger manages to prevail and escapes with the guys onto his ship. After a fierce but quick space battle, Roger escapes with the two guys and it looks like they're home free. Unfortunately Roger's luck catches up with him and they all get sucked into a black hole. Fortunately, instead of being annihilated, they are instead transported to some far off and strange galaxy. Landing on the only planet that can sustain life, they touch down and happen across a strange guy named Ken Williams who happens to own a software company himself. He immediately hires the two guys to make a game about their adventures with offers of riches and glory. Unfortunately they already have a janitor, so Roger gets back in his ship and sets off for sights unknown. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Space Quest 3 utilized Sierra's new SCI engine which brought an entirely new parser and updated graphics and sound card support. This game brought something new to the adventure game world: mouse support. Though you still interacted primarily through the arrow keys and a text parser, it was also possible to utilize the mouse for movement and inventory interaction. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for those hardcore gamers, this game still allowed many irreversible deaths and dead end puzzles. [CR]Astro Chicken [CR] Astro Chicken Title ScreenAstro Chicken was a minigame included within Space Quest 3, that featured a hidden message randomly displayed when the player received a high score. The goal of the game was to land a chicken on a trampoline. Upon doing so the chicken would let out a resounding "Bacock!", and then you would repeat. The game has similarities to Lunar Lander but the chicken rebounds from the trampoline if it lands too hard. The name of the game is considered a possible parody of the identically named thought experiment by theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson. A sequel to Astro Chicken (Ms. Astro Chicken) was included as a playable minigame in Space Quest IV. The Astro Chicken developer, Scum Soft, is almost certainly a reference to Sierra's adventure game arch rival, LucasArts, and their ScummVM engine. [CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game received very good critical reviews from the various media at the time generally getting 4 out of 5 or around 80% mark reviews.

			<plot>Space Station is a platform action adventure in which the player takes the role of a space ship commander. The station is attacked by aliens and must be destroyed. Sadly, the floppy disk with the destruction code is hidden somewhere in the 99 rooms and must be found first. To be able to escape from the station, fuel for a space ship has to be collected during the way.The player can jump and shoot, although before using the weapon, ammunition packs must be found and therefore using the pistol is very limited. In the station robots and aliens are attacking and lifts, teleporters and jump-pads allow the player to navigate through the many different connections between the rooms. The screen flicks between the rooms, no scrolling is involved. There is only one life, but a generous energy level, which is decreased on contact with enemies. No falling damage occurs, but jumping into the void instantly ends the game.</plot>

			<plot>Spaceball is a basic Pong variant. The plot is set in 2164 and the planet Utalis was conquered by the Jitter-Bobs. Their only chance for freedom is to beat the invaders in a Spaceball competition.The utilities consist of two paddles which are positioned on the left and right side of the screen; either one or both controlled by human players. Both participants try to hold a ball on the playfield by bouncing it back with their paddle. If a player lets the ball exit, the other receives points. Sometimes objects or yellow balls appear on the playfield: the former cause the ball's direction to change and the latter causes certain effects on the paddle which touched the ball last, e.g. a smaller, faster, bigger or disappearing paddle.</plot>

			<plot>Special Forces is a top-down arcade shooting game with a dash of strategy.[CR]It is the sequel to Airborne Ranger.[CR]When times are rough, the American people rely on their army. And when times are rough, the American army relies on their special forces. A small group of highly trained, superbly skilled, well-armed and clean-shaven elite soldiers boldly go where no man has gone before. At least no honest man.[CR]Special Forces let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.[CR]16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.</plot>

			<title_clean>Speedball</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Speed Dome.Speedball is a violent futuristic sports game that combines elements of handball, wrestling and football/rugby. It takes place somewhere in the 21st century and you control a team of five ballers who are wearing spiked armor bodywear, helmets and gloves. The 160 feet long and 90 feet wide play area, called the Speed Dome, is a arena surrounded by a 30 feet high steel-wall with a goal at either end. The aim is to get the steel-ball into the opponent's goal and there are no rules to accomplish this aim. So one can beat up the opponent players and the opponent goalkeeper as well to make it just that little easier to get to the goal and score. The mechanical ball launcher in the center of the play area spits out the ball in a random direction at the start of play and after a team scored a goal. There are two door-sized holes, called ball warp tunnels, positioned on opposing walls in the center of the arena. Throwing the ball into one of them causes it to reappear on the opposite side at exactly the same speed and angle as it entered. The four bounce domes appear in different formats on the play area for each match. The players can move freely over the bounce domes whereas the ball will be deflected off of the bounce domes.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp GatesThere are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like Nigel, Graham and Barry. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like Gaza, Roscopp and Jams to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay.[CR]</plot>

As a tough marine commando, you have been sent in to launch the counter-attacks.Sensibly, your boss drops you into the action in front of a mine field, and with no armour. Negotiate the mine field and you come into the main body of action, in which weaponry can be collected either from that which is left lying around, or by docking with a supply helicopter when it comes into view. Enemy ships are all around and must be taken out. Clear these and you reach the towers, which must be shot down, and finally a 'boss' ship to complete the level.</plot>

			<plot>The apprentices Sortice and his twin Ceroapp are ready to become certified sorcerers - but just now some nasties had to kidnap their teacher! No teacher means no graduation, and therefore the two have to rescue him by solving eight side-scrolling levels with different themes, e.g. a swamp, a cave system or the Island of Lost Souls. The game is meant to be played cooperatively (including friendly fire), but when playing alone only Sortice is present in the game.Spell Bound is a platformer with the main goal being to reach the end of the level without being killed by the various enemies. Players have six spells at their disposal which basically boil down to different weapon systems as well as levitation. Each spell except the standard attack drains manna which, exactly like life energy, is refilled by collecting power ups; either lying on the ground or in locked chests which have to be unlocked by finding the correct key first. Other useful objects include crystals for disrupting energy fields, bombs to blow up stone pillars, or a jet pack. Each character can carry one object at a time and, when trying to cast a spell without having the needed manna, will experience negative effects like reversed controls.</plot>

			<plot>Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.[CR]Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.</plot>

			<plot>On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.[CR]You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</plot>

			<plot>Spirit of Excalibur is an adventure/strategy game based on Arthurian legend.   It uses elements from Malory's Le Morte Darthur, John Boorman's film Excalibur, and modern-day retellings of the story.  Continuing where the traditional tale ended, Spirit of Excalibur depicts a new king and a new group of Knights of the Round Table attempting to end the threat of the sorceress Morgan le Fay once and for all. Similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth, Spirit uses an overhead map for character and army movement, and a close up side view to show specific locations and dialogue.  It also has an army combat screen, showing all fighting troops in a medium overhead view.  The game is divided into five chapters.  Within each chapter the player must guide characters between locations to fight, gather allies, or collect items.  Because items (such as strength potions or alchemical reagents like eye of newt) carry over between chapters, it is important to gather as much as possible as early as possible.  The chapters provide specific challenges: for example, in the third chapter the king and most of the Knights of the Round Table are trapped in Camelot, and the player must use their limited forces outside the castle to free them before invading Saxons conquer England. Though well regarded, the game was considered so difficult that Virgin eventually began to package the hint book with the boxed game.  Spirit was followed the next year by Vengeance of Excalibur, which featured a new Spanish setting and more story driven, smaller-scale combat.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.[CR]When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spy vs. Spy is a competitive multiplayer game based on the long-running MAD Magazine comic strip about two rival spies who are otherwise identical but for the color of their hat and trenchcoat. Befitting the comic's running gag, the goal of the game is to trick the opponent into blowing themselves up while the player character absconds with the valuable documents via an airplane.Developed by First Star Software, the game would eventually make its way onto many systems active in the 1980s. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players must check furniture in each of the game's many rooms, collecting three necessary items before heading to the exit to the airport to defeat their opponent. Players can also find trap items that they can plant in locations to trick their opponent: once the same furniture is checked, the traps will momentarily remove them from play. If the two spies meet in the same room, they cannot search furniture or plant traps. Instead, they can either duke it out until one of the two spies is temporarily eliminated or one of them can flee.Each spy has a personal countdown timer. When a spy is defeated they drop all their items, and are forced to sit out of the game for a few moments while their timer is depleted at a faster rate. The timer depletes 30 seconds per death.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of Columns. The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.[CR]Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a l Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).</plot>

			<plot>Star Command is a quite unknown sci-fi role-playing game by SSI, designed by Phantasie designer Winston Douglas Wood. It features a huge universe to be discovered, detailed character generation and development, a mass of items, some exotic aliens and tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.[CR]The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called "The Triangle" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain "Blackbeard", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.[CR]Game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity.[CR]Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.[CR]Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.[CR]After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship![CR]While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).[CR]While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire.[CR]Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.[CR]One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events.[CR]There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.[CR]All in all, the game play is simple to learn, but quite complex and addictive despite the crude graphics and nearly non-existent sound, as the game emphasizes on character development and atmosphere.</plot>

			<plot>In Star Fleet I: The War Begins, you are a cadet fresh out of Starfleet Academy and have assigned to command your first U.G.A.S. Starship! The Federation is currently at war with Krellans and Zaldrons, so choose your first ship from the Federation starport and prepare for your first mission!The graphics of the PC version of Star Fleet I: The War Begins are represented by ASCII characters. Everything from your starship, the mainframe to torpedoes are all ASCII characters. GameplayGameplay consists of fulfilling the target number enemy kills mentioned in the mission briefing in a specified amount of time. Higher levels demands more kills and less time requirements. Gameplay consists of 2 major areas:Main Computer and NavigationYour starship is equipped with state of the art navigation equipment. The main screen displays your main visual display, consisting of the main star chart map, your current position and visual displays. Other sections/information of the starship maybe accessed through the appropriate buttons.Navigation may be conducted automatically or manually. Standard navigation (automatically) is conducted by accessing the main computer and setting out a course. Higher levels may result on random events during navigation (such as electrical storms, running into asteroids or enemy ships). Each map is randomly generated and also uncharted. Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your current surroundings. For even further exploration, your starship also has probes to scan far-away quadrants. Combat: Starships, Starbases, and MarinesCombat is the essence of gameplay in Star Fleet I: The War Begins. Entities in a combat situation may consist of the following: Your starship, enemy Krellan starships (max 5 per quadrant), enemy cloaked Zaldron starships (usually one per quadrant), allied Starbase  and Space Marines.Combat initiates when your starship enters a hostile quadrant (portrayed by a red number on the main map), usually patrolled by a minimum of 1 (one) Krellan starship. Red Alert is automatically set (unless configured otherwise) resulting the rising of shields and direct attack by enemy starships. Enemy starships are either Krellan starships or the Zaldron cloaked. Krellan starships fire only phasors to soften up your shields. Although your starship is greatly over-matched compared to a single Krellan starship, numerous enemy ships will prove very dangerous. Zaldron starships are unique as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as their main weapon.This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit of moving around when eluding your torpedoes.Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some power reserves and enemy prisoners. Be warned that enemy prisoners or enemy spies may board your ship without your knowing and damage your ships systems (indicated by "Intruder Alert"). The enemy ship may then be towed to be transported to a Starbase.If enemies prove to much for you and your heavily damaged ship, you can opt for "Self-Destruction". Be warned, you will survive but it may hamper your mission score greatly.Unique combat situations refer to "Starbase Under Attack" where an allied Starbase is under attack by enemy starships, requiring your immediate attention for rescue.After successfully completing a mission, your mission success is rated: Number of enemies destroyed, captured, starbases rescued, etc. You will then be considered for a promotion or a commendation for a medal!</plot>

			<title_clean>Star Raiders</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doug Neubauer, one of the designers of a new Input/Output system which allowed for dynamic sound channels, created a game demo for the Atari 8-Bit computer, to demonstrate the new device. As Spacewar! before, the demo spawned a full standalone game: Star Raiders.Doug based the game on the text and primitive graphics based Star Trek games, where players would warp to a sector of space, eliminate enemies there, and warp to a new sector, defending starbases from attack and keeping an eye on your fuel. Star Raiders iterated upon this formula with action game trappings, adding 3D, real-time combat to Star Trek's strategic map-based view.Neubauer states that it was the first game to use 3-D algorithms which computed positions on all three axes. He explains why explosions in the game tend to slow it down: it took a lot of processing power then to guess the trajectory of the little particles that floated away from the destroyed target. In addition, he states:Today, of course, it's trivial, but back then it was state of the art. The game code is built up of modules: movement, control, collision detection, audio, photon firing, Zylon brain and console monitor. Special modules for galactic charts (and enemy strategy on charts) were included, along with a module for the long-range scanner.Atari 5200 OverlayThe game's success would prove to be a driving force behind Atari 8-bit sales, leading to contemporary ports to then-current Atari consoles. Due to the complexity of controls and gameplay, the Atari Touchpad controller was included in the 2600 release, with an overlay for Star Raiders - which would remain the sole game specifically designed for the controller. The Atari 5200's standard controller includes a keypad, so an overlay was supplied. Though keypads and overlays brought the gameplay closer to the Atari 8-Bit original, the game was simplified in various ways for both console releases.Solaris, also developed by Neubauaer, is a direct sequel, as is Star Raiders II, which Neubauaer was not involved in.Star Raiders' success would similarly lead to the first-person spaceflight combat genre's popularity, inspiring the seminal Elite, which in turn spawned games such as Wing Commander.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main interface Gameplay begins by choosing one of four difficulty levels. Higher difficulty results in more frequent, and more dangerous enemies. The objective is to obtain the highest game ranking, "Star Commander Class 1". The lowest possible ranking is "Galactic Cook Class 5". Rank is determined via a number of factors including energy used, damage taken, enemies killed, and more.Star Raiders features a complex series of options for controlling the ship, engaging in combat, and managing energy. The screen is divided into two parts: The majority of the screen is a 3D real-time combat field. Centered is a crosshair which indicates weapon trajectory, and view orientation. Switching from fore to aft view changes the crosshair to a dash to indicate a rear-facing perspective.A heads-up display on the lower right includes targeting data: proximity, and lock-on assistance.The lower portion of the screen features a display including:V: The ship's current velocityK: Enemy killsE: Energy units remaining out of 9999 possibleT / C: Tracking or Attack computer status&#920; (theta): Horizontal coordinate with respect to current targeted enemy&#934; (phi): Vertical coordinate with respect to current targeted enemyR: Absolute distance to target (negative is behind ship)In addition to the on-screen display, a variety of control options are available to the player using keyboard input (Original Atari 8-Bit version), the included touchpad controller (Atari 2600) or the Atari 5200 controller. The Atari 8-Bit version has the most complete set of controls, while the console versions are simplified in various ways.Selecting a number between 0 and 9 sets the speed of the shipA/F Sets the current view to aft or fore, as indicated by the shape of the crosshair. Controls reverse for aft viewC/M Toggles the computer between Attack Control (the current status is indicated on the heads-up display) or manual targetingG Brings up the Galactic ChartH Engages HyperwarpL Engages the Long Range Sector ScanS Engages shieldsT Engages Tracking ModeP Pauses the gameThe Galactic ChartThe Galactic ChartThe Galactic Chart is a strategic map representing all sectors (individual grid cells) in the galaxy, and is where the player assesses threats on star bases, determines the direction and cost of hyperwarp jumps, and can review the Star Date and damage to Star Cruiser 7.EnemiesA number of dashes in a sector represents the number of Zylon enemies in that sector, from 1 to 4. A sector with a single dash may have 1 or 2 enemies. Speed is inversely proportional to the number of enemies, so thinning an enemy fleet also increases the speed of that enemy fleet, adding strategic decision making to engagement. The Targets indicator displays the number of targets in the sector that the cursor is currently hovering over.StarbasesThe star burst symbols represent stationary star bases, where the player repairs and refueles. Should all of them be destroyed, the game is lost, but every one lost results in a major reduction score, thereby reducing the player's final rank at the conclusion of the game.If a star base is surrounded, time is counting down before the Zylon fleet will destroy it. Every 50 time units that pass mean Zylons may move, and before too many more, should a base be surrounded, it will be destroyed. Should two bases be surrounded, only one will be the target, although it's up to the player to figure out which one is the intended target.HyperwarpA cursor, which looks like a photon bolt at long distance, helps the player plan where the ship is going to move on the Galactic Chart. As the player moves the cursor, the Warp Energy indicator will increase, showing the fuel drain of a given jump, from the sector the player is currently in to the target sector. After a certain amount, the energy drain jumps up dramatically. Whether or not this is planned, should the ship's course deviate too much away from the ship's start position, this fuel penalty will occur.Damage ControlThe letters following 'DC' represent the different functions which are vulnerable to damage. The letters turn yellow when a system is damaged, and pink when destroyed:P: Photons. Damage to this system means that one of the two photon torpedo emitters are down.E: Engines. Engines are a vital system when pursuing evasive targets, and when maneuvering to dock with a star base. Hyperspace engines cannot be damaged and are independent of the vulnerable Engine systems. Damage to the engines means that velocity is substandard, and also varies wildly from second to second, creating a violent stop-start effect past a certain velocity. Low velocities are relatively predictable, but high ones can often make the player overshoot the target during star base docking and pursuit maneuvers.S: Shields. If the shields are off, any hit by Zylon fire or asteroids instantly obliterate the ship. While on, shields lose energy when struck, and in higher difficulty levels, this hit usually results in damage or destruction of a subsystem. Should shields be damaged, they flash on and off at a random rate. While on, they provide protection like normal shields. While off, they leave the craft vulnerable, but they still cost energy to maintain. Destroyed shields leave the ship completely vulnerable, but still cost to leave them activated.C: Attack Computer. The attack computer is a power-draining system which includes target tracking, crosshair placement, and guided photon attacks during lock-ons. Damage to this subsystem removes the attack computer from the screen, although it still drains energy until turned off. Destruction of the system results in a frozen range finder, necessitating use of the long range sector scan for target tracking, should the enemy not be aggressive.L: Long Range Sector Scan. The sector scan helps the player locate all enemies in the sector, even when the game limits combat to two opponents at a time. Although difficult, combat kills can be achieved through this screen. Asteroids also show up on the sector scan. Damage to the sector scan results in a double image. Destruction of the system results in complete loss of functionality.R: Sub-space Radio. This is the system that keeps track of enemy movement, and informs the player of Zylons' star base surrounding and destruction. Should the radio be damaged, players will not reliably receive messages that a star base is surrounded or destroyed. In addition, the Galactic Chart is frozen in the last enemy/star base layout the player saw. The cursor still functions, but the only way a player can tell how many targets are in a given sector is with the target indicator at the bottom of the galactic chart screen.Long Range Sector ScanLong Range Scan The Long Range Sector Scan screen is a subset of the main screen, displaying the contents of the current sector. The player can pilot the craft, aim and fire photon torpedoes (forward only), and accelerate into hyperspace, though less quickly than from the Galactic Chart.Any asteroids, photon torpedoes, debris, Zylons, star bases, or refuel-and-repair craft in the sector are displayed as dark dashes. They will be in a sphere around the spaceship (represented in the center of the screen, with fore pointing up, and aft pointing down). Due to the similarity of all objects, the player must deduce the identity of an object based on movement pattern.Star Base Docking and DestructionDocking procedure Docking with a star base restores a ship's energy count to a full 9999, and repairs all damage. Every time a player docks, the score drops by a small amount, which in turn affects the final player ranking.The player must navigate the saucer-like star base within the cross hairs, and the attack computer should has the base in full lock. Proper distance and orientation are necessary to activate the star base docking procedure. When at the proper distance, a message will come up telling the player that the procedure has begun. Moving the ship aborts the sequence. Once docked, the ship is instantly repaired and refueled, and can now leave the sector.If a player is in a star base sector when it is destroyed, Zylons will instantly be in the sector. A player can destroy a star base with torpedoes.Hyperwarp JumpIn Hyperwarp Hyperwarp moves the player from one sector to another quickly, and costs fuel. Engaging hyperwarp is possible within the Galactic Map, the Long Range Sensor Scan, or on the main combat screen. While in hyperwarp, photon torpedoes no longer function, and at higher velocities, enemy photons will not be able to harm the player, making it a useful tactic to disengage from combat. The faster the ship is moving, the more quickly hyperwarp engages. In the center of the screen a small cross symbol will appear. The closer to the center this cross is, the closer to the center of the reference point on the Galactic Chart the ship will go.Hyperspace engines will always work given enough fuel. The galactic chart allows the player to change the point of reference that the center of the screen represents.When leaving hyperspace, the player can fire photons again.[CR]Cultural Notes[CR]Star Raiders was released during a revival of science fiction which followed the first Star Wars film. It also seemed strongly influenced by the original Star Trek series, which was still present in the public mindset. Faster than light travel was referred to as hyperwarp, warp being a staple term in Star Trek's faster than light travel, and the weapons both players and Zylons use are photons, referred to sometimes as photon torpedoes, one of the main weapons in the Star Trek franchise. It may also be relevant to note that early games that featured Star Trek were often of similar design, where the player commands a Federation starship, warping from sector to sector to defend star bases from marauding enemies, keeping an eye on the fuel gauge and taking damage to ship subsystems.Another subtle Star Trek reference seems to have been in the design of the Zylon cruiser. As it draws close, one notices a bump between the two curved arches that point downward from the ship's middle. This close-up view could be seen to look like the head-on view of the classic Klingon Cruiser design.References don't seem to stop at Star Trek, though. Star Wars was referenced by the Zylon fighter, which closely resembled the TIE-fighters used by the Galactic Empire.  [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Based on the original Star Wars film, this game had players reliving the climactic assault on the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin. Players fly their X-Wing through three stages to destroy the Death Star. After that, they attack it again at a higher difficulty until they get a game over.The  cockpit version of the game The arcade game had two different kinds of cabinets: a traditional stand-up cabinet like most arcade games, and also a sit down cockpit version similar to what you'd see in driving games. The controller was an analog yoke which offered a high level of precision when aiming the on screen reticle to attack various targets.Attacking TIEs in level 1The gameplay was split into three sections. In the first section, you approach the Death Star in what is essentially a rail shooter. In this section, players do not have control of where their ship flies. TIE Fighters shoot "fireballs" at players, which can then be shot down to avoid taking damage. Players can also shoot Darth Vader's TIE Advanced for a large bonus, but it is not possible to destroy his ship.The Death Star's surfaceIn the next section, players skim the surface of the Death Star to attack turrets and towers. In this section, players have full control of where they fly and must weave in between the towers while also shooting them down. Each tower they destroy offers a much higher point bounty than the one before it, and a bonus is awarded to players who can destroy all of the towers before time runs out. This section of the game is skipped on level 1.The Trench RunThe final section of the game recreates the climactic trench run. Turrets shoot more fireballs at the player while they navigate the trench. Players can fire at the turrets and fireballs to help defend themselves, but will receive a huge bonus if they are able to "Use the Force" to fly through the trench without firing any shots. At the end of the level, the player must fire a proton torpedo at the exhaust port to win the game and start again on the next difficulty. Depending on the arcade machine's dip switches, bonus shields are sometimes awarded for the next round.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The arcade game from Atari based on the third Star Wars movie features three action sequences inspired by the film. [CR]First, you control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor. You have to evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps.[CR]In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading tree traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to the Millennium Falcon which you must guide through a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters.[CR]In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star and has to make its way to the reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have to get out again before the explosion engulfs the ship.[CR]After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher difficulty.</plot>

			<plot>The arcade game from Atari Games based on the second Star Wars movie features four action sequences inspired by the film. The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector graphics with a first-person perspective.[CR]The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks.[CR]In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be destroyed and the evacuation begins.[CR]In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has to destroy TIE Fighters in space.[CR]In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions.[CR]Once the four sections have been completed, the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Stardust a critically acclaimed space shooter game released originally in 1993 for the Amiga 500 by developer Bloodhouse. Later ports of the game were also released for the PC and Atari STE but lacked the quality of the original release. Stardust came about when Finnish programmer Harri Tikkanen began early work on a pinball game, he would later discover that Swedish developer Digital Illusions was about to release a very similar game called Pinball Dreams and so he was forced to come up with a brand new concept which would become Stardust.The gameplay is heavily inspired by the arcade hit, Asteroids. Stardust expands on this formula by allowing the player to collect numerous weapons throughout the game's 30 levels and then to power them up over time. Certain bosses and enemies are weak against particular weapons. Some of the levels change up the formula by having the spaceship fly through a tunnel while shooting enemies and avoiding oncoming debris.Another of the game's distinguishing features is its sense of humor. The story features a mad professor, secret agents disguised as meteorites, a final level named after a Finnish town, and a princess named after a brand of margarine.Reception[CR]On release, the game received positive reviews from many outlets, Amiga Computing and Amiga Force gave the game 93 and 92 percent receptively. The main criticism of the game was the steep learning curve which made it prohibitively difficult for a lot of players. The team took this into account and decided to revamp Stardust by improving the game and adding new content. This lead to the creation of Super Stardust released for the Amiga 1200 in 1994.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Starflight</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Title Screen (DOS)Starflight takes place in a galaxy comprised of 270 star systems, each of which contains a number of planets (there are over 800 planets in all). Each planet has its own unique topography, climate, and gravity. The player is tasked to maintain, upgrade and staff their own starship in an RPG-like fashion. The ship is used to explore the galaxy and retrieve artifacts, minerals, and life forms from the surface of planets, which can then be sold to further upgrade the ship and the skills of its crew. While exploring the galaxy, players may also come across a number of alien races. How the player chooses deal with these encounters plays a major role in the progression of the game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The story begins on a planet named Arth. Years earlier, scientists discovered a deep shaft in the crust of the planet, leading to a vast and ancient underground network. Investigation of this network revealed it to have been built by the first colonists of Arth (remnants of an ancient society called the Old Empire). In addition to this historical data, scientists also uncovered sufficient technical data which allowed them reconstruct some of the Old Empire's technology. The most significant discovery was that of a mysterious crystalline substance known as Endurium, which served as the fuel for their superphotonic (faster than light) technology. Space TravelUsing this information, a company named Interstel is able to successfully build new ships capable of interstellar travel. With limited supplies of fuel available, Interstel builds a small fleet of ships and tasks them to search the galaxy for more resources (most importantly, Endurium). Players assume the role of a starship captain recruited by the Interstel corporation. In addition to procuring Endurium and other important minerals, players are also given a number of other goals: search for new habitable planets; discover more information about the Old Empire and the history of Arth; and build relationships with the other spacefaring races in the galaxy.As resources are built and more of the galaxy is explored, this initial setup (while seemingly simple) eventually gives way to a more complex over-arching narrative. Through a series of events (involving hostile alien races, ancient artifacts, and a mysterious Crystal Planet), the fate of the entire galaxy ends up in the player's hands![CR]The Making of Starflight[CR]The Starflight TeamThe following information is taken verbatim from the packaging of the DOS version of Starflight:The Dream"Back in 1982, we approached E.A. with the idea of creating a universe on a disk that would let people experience the feeling of exploring the universe. It was an ambitious idea. We knew it would require a lot of time and the development of some new technology. We were more right than we knew."The Cutting Room Floor"We rewrote the game script several times as we struggled to achieve our goals. We wanted the universe to convey a gigantic sense of space, complexity, and life. And we wanted an exciting fantasy role-playing game, with a wide spectrum of character interaction and activity. It seemed like whenever we were close to finalizing the script, we'd find another way to make the game more fun."The Planet Builder"About nine months after we started the actual programming, we came up with the idea for the fractal generator. A fractal generator so powerful that it could create surfaces in space. It took 6 man-years to create the technology, but it gave us the ability to cram 800 complex and unique planets into each game, instead of the 50 we'd had before. There are so many that even we haven't explored them all."The Aliens"To find the right names for each race, we wrote long profiles and histories for each, then tossed random syllables at each other for several days. To handle their languages, behavior, and combat-action, we had to devote months to building a sophisticated artificial intelligence system. We threw away the communications module three times before we had exactly what we wanted. Sometimes we wondered which would come first, flying to the stars in Starflight, or flying to the stars in real life."Breathing Ammonia"Once the fractal generator builds a planet, the eco-system generator creates environmental conditions for it, like gravity, atmosphere, minerals, and temperature. Once we took a journey back to Earth, only to find the eco-system generator had given it new continents and an ammonia atmosphere. It took two years to perfect the technology."15 Man-Years Later"The last several months were spent tying all the various technologies together. Because of the program's complexity and scope, the play-testing alone took months. But all the time and effort has proven worthwhile. We had a vision of what an outer space fantasy game could be, and now that vision is a reality."[CR]</plot>

As you go along you'll have to obtain objects from people, and trade them so as to be able to complete your main objectives.[CR]The biggest advance from the original Starglider was seen as the polygon graphics, which are filled on 16-bit systems, and contain considerable detail.</plot>

			<plot>The space ship Steel is so advanced that it is completely operated by robots. As usually in video games, these robots went havoc and have to be put out of business. This job falls to the player who goes on the ship to shut down the security system. He is disguised as robot, but this does not stop the other ones from attacking.So the player wanders around the maze-like ship, consisting of non-scrolling screens, with the ultimate goal to collect eight cartridges. The player can hold up to three at the same time and needs to bring them to the main control panel. The enemy robots can be blasted away with the laser weapon, but contact costs energy. Losing all energy results in death, but it can be refilled in special stations which are spread over the ship. Using them costs points from the high score. There are also some terminals which need to be cleared by solving a mini game. It basically consists of shooting a wall enough within a time limit without being hit by bullets.</plot>

If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.   </plot>

			<plot>You are Steigar and you used to make your living as a mercenary being paid to complete missions big or small as long as the price was right. That was until the CIA managed to find you and take you prisoner, but you were too good at your job and so they have made you join the US Navy and become a helicopter pilot to participate in one man missions against various threats to the USA. The game is a scrolling horizontal shoot-em-up viewed from the side as you start out on an aircraft carrier and fly over various assigned missions while shooting and killing many waves of enemies including helicopters, planes, boats and tanks that come at you as you move from the left to the right. Complete the mission and it's onto the next one but touch an enemy or its weapon and you lose one of five lives. You have a standard cannon but power-ups can be collected from shooting certain enemies. Also to help you are limited smart-bombs that kill all on the screen.</plot>

			<title_clean>Steve Davis World Snooker</title_clean>
			<plot>Steve Davis World Snooker is an updated 16-bit version of CDS' earlier 8-bit Steve Davis game.  It offers not only snooker (with ten or fifteen red balls), but also other cue sports: Pool (UK and USA versions) and Billiards (English and Carom - no pockets). These can all be single player, two player or human versus computer (In the guise of Steve Davis). The program has six different levels of playing skill. The view is fixed overhead, however you can zoom in on the table. Slow motion replays are included.[CR]The game also has a practice mode, in which lines indicate what the results of a shot will be, and balls can be moved around to set up trick shots.</plot>

			<title_clean>Steve McQueen Westphaser</title_clean>
			<plot>This game came as a pack-in title with Loriciel's light gun controller of the same name.  Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens.Up to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination.  Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads.Each location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent).  When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours.Apparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.</plot>

			<plot>Stone Age is a challenging puzzle game where you are in control of a dinosaur and you have to make him reach the exit of each cave. The dinosaur can only walk on certain blocks on the level: some are just ordinary blocks, some are movable in the direction the arrow points, some crumble after you walk on them, and some have coloured keys which are needed to get past locks of the same colour.[CR]The game has two difficulty modes, one giving you more time to complete the levels than the other, and every time you run out of time, you lose a life. The levels are coded so you don't lose your progress when you quit, although you'll lose any score gained.[CR]The graphics are simple and cartoony, and the levels come in a variety of scenarios. The game also includes a Jukebox, which allows you to customize the played tracks much like a playlist editor.</plot>

			<title_clean>Street Fighter</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Capcom for arcades in 1987. The first in a long-spanning fighting game series of the same name, it follows either martial artists Ryu or Ken as they participate in a worldwide martial arts tournament.While it did not achieve the same popularity as its sequels (particularly  Street Fighter II), it introduced many elements to the then-bare fighting game genre (including a six-button control scheme and special command-based techniques). Along with Ryu and Ken, the game introduced a variety of opponents that would return to the series as playable fighters (including Sagat, Gen, Adon, Birdie, and Eagle).Two arcade cabinets were sold for this game: regular and deluxe. The regular version (which was sold as a tabletop cabinet in Japan and an upright cabinet overseas) featured the same six-button configuration (three for punches and three for kicks) used in most of Capcom's later fighting games. The deluxe version featured two pressure-sensitive pads (one for punches and one for kicks), determining the strength and speed of the player's attacks based on how hard the pads were pressed. This is the only fighting game to utilize pressure-sensitive pads for attacks.The port for the  TurboGrafx CD (known as Fighting Street) was the first game released on that system, utilizing an arranged soundtrack. Because the console did not have any six-button configurations, the strength and speed of the attacks were determined by how long each of the action buttons were pressed. The game was also ported to the  Commodore 64,  ZX Spectrum,  Amstrad CPC,  MS-DOS,  Amiga, and  Atari ST. There were actually two ports to the Commodore 64, one by Capcom USA and one by Tiertex in the UK (who went on to develop the unofficial sequel,  Human Killing Machine). The original arcade version was included in Capcom Arcade Hits Volume 1 for the PC,  Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for the  PlayStation Portable, and  Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 for the  Xbox and  PlayStation 2.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Single player mode can be played as Ryu (when playing as the left player) or as Ken (when playing as the right player). A second player could join at any time and challenge the first player. Depending on the arcade configuration, the player can choose between either two or four nations to start off with (Japan, U.S.A., England, or China). The player must battle through all eight opponents, two from each nation, in order to reach the two boss characters from Thailand.Special MovesStreet Fighter is the first fighting game to provide a secret move list with special command-based abilities. The game debuts three now-iconic special moves: Hadouken (known in international versions as "Ball of Fire") - The original fighting game fireball technique, done by holding down on the joystick, then moving forward in the direction of the opponent, then pressing a punch button. (Known as "quarter-circle forward punch" (QCF-P), or the "fireball motion") Shoryuken (known in international versions as "Dragon Punch") - Jumping uppercut attack, done by moving the joystick towards the opponent, then down, then down and towards the opponent, then pressing a punch button. (Known as the "Z-motion", or "dragon punch motion" (DP-P)) Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku (known in international versions as "Hurricane Kick") - A horizontally moving kick attack, done by holding down on the joystick, then moving away in the opposite direction of the opponent, then pressing a kick button.

			<plot>The original Street Fighter II is a famous fighting game. Players select from one of eight characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own reasons for wanting to win against the others.[CR]Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the "button combination" style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.[CR]Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for making popular several different elements.</plot>

			<plot>In Street Gang the player takes the role of Mickey who just moved from the country to New York. Now he wants to become one of the big boys and join the street gang. But they set him a challenge: cutting off a curl of hair from their leader...So in conclusion Mickey walks from left to right while defending himself again the enemy hordes. The game plays out as a standard brawler in which Mickey uses hand-to-hand combat against the foes. However, when he gets the hand of them he also can use other items like guns, baseball bats or teargas. Being hit by opponents, which sometimes hide in garbage bins, drain Mickey's energy and eventually one of his lives.</plot>

He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all.[CR]Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.</plot>

			<plot>Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.[CR]The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</plot>

			<title_clean>Strike Force Harrier</title_clean>
			<plot>Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.[CR]Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.</plot>

The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.</plot>

			<plot>It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</plot>

			<plot>Sub Battle Simulator is set in World War 2, with the player on the American or German side. Six different submarines are simulated in a total of 60 missions. You will have to navigate, using five different levels of mapping, and plan attacks based on weather and surroundings, paying close attention to the radar. Watch out for torpedoes and Sonars.[CR]This was the first submarine simulation to include aircraft as opponents. You can choose to remain on the surface and defend yourself with your guns, or dive and hope to avoid the bomb and/or strafing that'll surely follow.</plot>

You get more and better weapons and power-ups. Best are the homing missiles. Blow up the competition! Racing can besometimes frustrating if you are persistently blown up by all the othercars before you have time or sufficient race-winnings to buy extra shieldsfor your car. There is a control option whereby your car automatically accelerates and the fire button is used to brake. Full back to fire a missile. Quick replexes are vital! Lots of fun is the split-screen two-player option. This allows for competetive play against a friend but gives you limited view of the track.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Cauldron and Cauldron II were successful in the 8-bit days, and this moved the series forward. You play a witch (although the character looks decidedly masculine, for no apparent reason), and have to negotiate four worlds, each split into bite-size chunks. [CR]The levels are populated with bats, trolls and snakes, which have programmed attack patterns and follow you off the screen. You can collect and cast up to 12 spells, which are accessed using the cursor or function keys (the manual amusingly refers to Amigas having F11 and F12 keys, which they don't). These include upgraded weapons (the default one isn't especially powerful), and help such as magic staircases and a metal melter. Some sections of water kill you, other identical ones take you to different sections.</plot>

Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.</plot>

			<plot>The game was released in arcades in 1989 and for the Sega Mega Drive in 1990 and is an arcade racing game in the style of Formula One.Although the original arcade version of the game consisted of the one circuit, a re-imagination of the Circuit de Monaco, the Sega Mega Drive port has a world championship mode, which consists of 16 race weekends. The 1989 F1 season is used as a basis for circuits and drivers, although the drivers only loosely resemble the real world counterparts.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The arcade version of the game was simpler in design than the Mega Drive counterpart, featuring only the one track. The player chooses between automatic or manual transmission and then begins qualifying. The player must qualify in under 45 seconds to progress to the race. In the race mode, the player must stay in front of a certain position in the field. This begins at 20th, but increases as the player reaches checkpoints, finally ending at 3rd place.In the Mega Drive version, The player can fail to qualify and begin the race from the back of the grid.The World championship mode, not featured in the arcade version, gave the goal of winning a season, with points being awarded similar to the real life sport. To add replay value, one the season is over the player goes on to defend the title. In the second season the player is given a seat at the games fictional super team, and is assigned a difficult rival.In this mode, the player drives for team Minarae, and is able to choose another driver as his rival. If the player beats the rival in 2 consecutive race weekends, the rivals team will offer a place to the player. This allows the player to drive for faster cars, and acts as a difficulty curve.If the player wins two championships, the game is considered over.[CR]Drivers[CR]Class ADriver NameDriver TeamReal world DriverReal world Equivalent TeamA.

			<plot>Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of scrambling/ motorcross, but in a manner similar to the Kikstart TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.[CR]The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.</plot>

			<plot>In the sequel to Seymour Goes to Hollywood, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an eco-friendly superhero. With game design showing some obvious influence from Bomb Jack, Seymour jumps around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.</plot>

Set in famous resorts of French Alps  such as Val-d'Isre, Courchevel, or La Tania, ski events may be practiced in Training mode, or taken on in a sequence of 2 of each in Competition mode. [CR]Almost all events show the player from behind, except Moguls, where screen is scrolling down with players` progress, and Ski Jump, where player should come to camera from the far view. Player should avoid obstacles, stay on a route, and pass the gates in Slalom-like events; stay on the route in Bobsleigh, finish in first place with more style and jumps in Moguls, and jump good in Ski Jump.[CR]1-2 players mode is available.</plot>

The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move left-right or top-bottom.League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on &#8211; if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition. </plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Racing ActionSuper Sprint is a racing game with a top down perspective. The game has only 8 circuits, but cycles through them repeatedly, for a total of 85 races. Each cycle gets progressively more difficult by the addition of new obstacles, such as oil slicks and tornadoes. Wrenches could be obtained during races, which could then be used to upgrade the player's car in-between races. Upgrading the car allowed a certain degree of customization, since the car's traction, speed, and acceleration were upgrading independently.In arcades, the game could be played by up to three human players. The arcade version was controlled with a steering wheel and foot pedal.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In the future, humanity suffers from a deadly virus. The only antidote functions like a drug and big corporations exploit this situation. They are free to act without any supervision and this results in armed war between them. The hero Jonah Hayes, small-time smuggler, has no part in this until he gets force-employed by one of those corporations to bring a living freight, a product of genetic engineering, to Earth. Suspicious Cargo is a text adventure with a graphical user interface. It is not necessary to type in commands into the text field; the commands can be constructed by clicking on the symbols of the user interface. When talking to other people, the topic can be chosen from a list. The symbol bars can be hidden in order to play the game as pure text adventure - the only bar which is always shown is the systems bar. It offers the possibility to open up a full-screen picture to illustrate some situations and a map which is used to quickly travel inside the space ship. The challenges faced in the game mostly deal with obstacles the hero faces on his way to Earth, e.g, sabotage acts by competing companies. There are also some action sequences like opening a lock or landing on a moon spliced into the story, but those are completely optional.</plot>

If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. [CR]Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Containing elements of Super Mario Brothers, Rana Rama and Rick Dangerous this 2D flip-screen platformer is a mixture of an action (punch 'n' shoot 'em up) and an exploration game. Switchblade puts the player in the role of Hiro, a sort of Japanese comic-style hero and the only surviving Bladeknight who has to reassemble a sword called Fireblade and destroy therewith the evil Havok. The scenario is accompanied by clautrophobic atmospheric backdrops, detailed sprites and moody tunes. It was developed by Simon Phipps (also author of Rick Dangerous) from Core Design and published by Gremlin in 1989 on all popular 8-bit and 16-bit homecomputers at the time. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Scenario (Amiga)After 10 000 years of peace Havok has returned on the cyber world of Thraxx. The Fireblade, source of strength for the ancient Bladeknights, has shattered and its power died. Seizing the opportunity, the evil Havok and his nightmare creations have slaughtered the people of the Undercity and taken control of Thraxx. The Bladeknights died helpless alongside their people and only one of their order survived. The last of the Bladeknights is Hiro, a hi-tech warrior armed with a powerfull reprogrammable cyber-arm, who now must enter the Undecity and reassemble the sixteen fragments of the shattered Fireblade. Only then can he take on Havok and avenge the death of his people. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Entering Undercity (Amiga)The 128 screens of the cyber world Thraxx (consisting of the surface of Thraxx and the Undercity) are self-mapping. So each screen is made up of smaller screens which only light up once they have been entered. It means the need for careful observation and exploration is enhanced, or a vital entrance to a new area might be missed.The main protagonist Hiro can run, jump and climb up and down ladders. Hiro can fight in a hand-to-hand mode against his enemies or destroy them with a collected weapon. Fighting in a hand-to-hand mode Hiro can throw a punch, a high kick or a low sweeping kick. Which move Hiro will perform in a hand-to-hand fighting mode depends on how long the fire button is pressed and held down. Because by pressing and holding down the fire button the "power meter bar" increases(shown at the right bottom of the screen) and the combat move Hiro will perform is more powerfull. Hiro can also use up to seven weapons against his enemies like a blade, scorchball, dart, spinblade, needle bolts, trispike and the most powerfull weapon the Fireblade itself after collecting the sixteen fragments of it. Which weapon Hiro is using is shown by the "weapon indicator display" at the middle bottom of the screen by a corresponding symbol. If Hiro is fighting in a hand-to-hand mode the weapon indicator display shows a fist.Hiro facing Havok (Amiga)Bonuses like gems(which vary in size), flasks or orbs are found throughout the game, hidden in such locations as walls or simply scattered around the corridors and rooms. Also single letters can be collected by Hiro which light up at the bottom of the screen and form the words EXTRA and BONUS. Spelling EXTRA gains the player an extra life and spelling BONUS gains the player a bonus 10000 points.[CR]Boss Enemies[CR]Level 1Giant SpikelouseLevel 2Giant ScorpoidLevel 3Giant CybatLevel 4Giant RoborganismLevel 5Havok  [CR]Hand-to-hand combat[CR] MovePower Meter Bar PunchA punch will be performed by pressing and releasing the fire button with the meter in the first quarter of the power meter bar. High KickA high kick will be performed by pressing and releasing the fire button with the meter in the second and third quarters of the power meter bar. Low Sweeping KickThe strongest move, the low sweeping kick, will be performed by pressing  and releasing the fire button with the meter in the final quarter of the power meter bar.    [CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Symbol shown in "Weapon Indicator Display"Collectable Fist ShieldBy collecting the "Fist Shield" Hiro will fight in the hand-to-hand combat. The three moves Hiro can perform are described above. Blade ShieldBy collecting the "Blade Shield" Hiro's cyber arm may fire blades. The range of this weapon increases by pressing and holding down the fire button. Dart ShieldDarts are of limited range - pressing and holding down the fire button has no effect on the range or power of this weapon. Needle bolt ShieldThe number of the needle bolts (from one up to three) fired by the cyber arm and with that the hit power can be increased by pressing and holding down the fire button.  Scorchball ShieldA scorchball will take a hit on every enemy that stands in its trajectory and will only stop when it hits a wall or exceeds its range. Spinblade ShieldThe speed at which the spinblades are fired can be increased by pressing and holding down the fire button. Trispike ShieldTrispikes are of unlimited range - pressing and holding down the button has no effect on the range or power of this weapon. Fireblade fragmentThe most powerfull weapon in the game and the only one Havok can be beaten with. Hiro's cyber arm will automatically fire them after the 16 fragments of the scattered Fireblade have been collected. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Switchblade II is a side-scrolling platformer-action game set in a dystopian sci-fi world with an art style that is partially based on manga and anime. It was released for the Atari ST and Amiga home computers, like its 1989 predecessor Switchblade, and was later made available on the Atari Lynx handheld.The player character, Hiro, must make his way through various overworld and underworld locations to take down the villain of the previous game, Havoc, who has re-emerged after thousands of years of peace and dormancy. Hiro has his trusty blade for close combat, but can also rely on his gun cannon arm if he has the ammo to fire it. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>You have travelled from the Mediterranean to the deserts of Persia in search of fortune. However, you have met with betrayal and been captured by brigands, who will spare your life only if you agree to enter the Fortress of the Dragon and return with the Sword of Kadash.The game is a top-down action/adventure game set within a maze of rooms and corridors. The player can move in any of the four directions (and diagonally), and fire darts. Only three darts can be fired at a time. These will ricochet off some walls, and be absorbed or cause holes to form in others. They are also the primary method for defeating the various monsters that are scattered about. Monsters can also be defeated by coming into contact with you, but you will in turn take damage.The player has a number of stats. These include health (hit-points) and Armour class, which measures the player's defensive ability and is increased by collecting better armor and rings. There is also experience which is increased by defeating monsters, and will cause the player to level up (increasing hit-points) every so often. The experience levels are equally spaced, with the gap depending on the game difficulty that is selected at the start of the game. The player's dart attack effectiveness is based on the weapon they are carrying, which may be dagger, morning-star, axe and sword, each of which may be enchanted up to +3.Many of the rooms will contain items, which can be collected by walking into them. Better armour or weapons will be equipped automatically. Some items are cursed, causing both armour and weapon to be cursed until a non-cursed holy symbol is collected. Healing boxes, keys and scrolls may also be found. Scrolls allow spells to be cast (using the return key) which temporarily cause monsters to flee from you. There are also secret passages, invisible walls, and a few alarms which cause traps to appear.</plot>

			<title_clean>Tactical Manager</title_clean>
			<plot>Following success with the mail-order Football Tactician series, Talking Birds entered the mainstream with this retitled version. It's a football management game, setting you in charge of one of the teams in the top 2 English divisions of the time and giving you control over transfers, tactics and training regimes as you aim to guide your team to success. Initially you can only manage the lower teams, but if you succeed over a few seasons you will become respected enough to have a chance to get the top roles.[CR]The focus is on ultra-realism, which makes it very hard to quickly transform a club's fortunes, as there is a lack of money at many of the smaller teams and attracting players is harder than in the Premier Manager series and similar. Matches are viewed from top-down highlights, with 3 levels of detail (goals-only, highlights and kick-by-kick) offered.</plot>

			<plot>Talespin is an adventure game creation system made by Mark Heaton and his family (wife and their five children), which allows you to create interactive graphic- and text-oriented adventure games, demos, books, tutorials, or whatever application you can think of. It offers graphics, 100 development commands, mouse control, no copy protection, hard drive support, and Telltale, a run-only module that allows users without Talespin to see your work.[CR]Talespin also includes two sample adventure games: The Grail made by 19-year-old Rudyard Heaton and The Wolf made by another artist[CR]The design idea that drives Talespin is a "page" built from drawings, text, and sound. Conditions and variables control the text, graphic, and action/solution possibilities, and all pages are linked to form a complete story sequence. The Chain To Title At Page option lets you connect one story to another, linking new or continuing tales across more than one disk.[CR]The paint/drawing program offers Pencil, Spray, Mini-Spray, Block, Blob, Line, and Fill functions. The Lens option allows magnification of a screen area for detailed work; Undo removes the most recent drawing action. Although Talesplin can handle 512 colors, the ST can display only 16 at a time (due to a hardware limitation); therefore, all drawings on a page must use the same palette. Pictures can be copied from other stories as well as sounds.[CR]Variables let you control the flow of text entries and drawings. Variables must be defined (CONVERSATION, for example), set to a level, and given conditions that will determine further text actions or movement to different pages. The proper setting of variables, their values, and their conditions provides for more than one action or solution for a given puzzle or problem.[CR]All the menu selections are controlled with the mouse: the pointer highlights, the left button selects. Clicking the right button brings up the dvelopment menu. The only oddity about Talespin concerns text. Clicking a character's head brings up a bubble, within which will appear the currently available choices. The mouse pointer is used to highlight either question; the left button selects it; the program will then take the appropriate action.</plot>

			<plot>For around 4000 years the Chinese have been enthralled by this puzzle concept. It consists of a set of 7 shapes, representing squares, triangles and trapezoids, which must be arranged to form a pre-defined pattern. In this version there are 200, representing things such as animals and buildings.[CR]The shapes are on the right of the screen, and you move the mouse cursor over one to select it, then place it onto the shape as required. They can be rotated using the right mouse button. [CR]All this is done against a time limit. As well as points for clearing a level, you get bonus time for completing them with time to spare. This bonus time can then be used on later levels if you run out of the allotted time. Once you have no bonus time, you can dig into your main score to provide more time.[CR]There are two difficulty levels - the Novice level sees time elapse half as quickly as the Expert mode, and presents the levels in an approximate order of difficulty, whereas in Expert mode they are in randomised order.</plot>

Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.[CR]Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. [CR]16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Team Yankee is a tank simulation/strategy game based on the novel by Harold Coyle. Team Yankee was developed by Oxford Digital Enterprises (Atari ST and Amiga versions), and The Assembly Line (PC version). The game was published by Empire Interactive Entertainment for all releases.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The scenarios in Team Yankee are based on the chapters of the novel, also called Team Yankee written by Harold Coyle.Tank Identification TestOne of the test ScreensIf the player chooses to play a scenario other than the practice scenario a test must be taken. A tank (either NATO or Warsaw) profile (10 different views) will be shown and the player must name the type of tank. If the player can get three answers correct than the scenario can be played. Knowing the various types of tanks is very important in Team Yankee as friendly tanks are not labeled as such during gameplay.Mission BriefingsBefore each scenario the player is presented with a mission briefing screen. On the mission briefing screen there is a map of the battlefield, a text briefing describing the mission, and the ability to place artillery strikes.BattlesIn Team Yankee the player can take control of any of the four tanks in any of the four platoons, which makes sixteen tanks able to be controlled in all. The display screen can be changed from a quadrant mode or a full screen mode. In the quadrant mode the player can see all four platoons in their own split screen. In full screen mode the view zooms in on one specific platoon.WeaponsWeaponDescriptionHeat RoundAn explosive round that blows up on contact.Sabot RoundAn armor piercing round that is made up of tungsten.T.O.W MissileAn anti-tank missile that has a very long range that must be fired from a stationary tank.Smoke GrenadeA smoke grenade that when used creates a cloud of smoke.Machine GunThe machine gun is a typical tank mounted machine gun and has an infinite number of ammo.[CR]Tanks[CR]M-1 Abrams Main Battle TankM-1 Abrams Main Battle TankCrew - 4Weight (In Tons) - 54.5Length (In cm) - 977Engine Type - TurbineRoad Range (In km) - 498Max Speed (On Road) - 72.4Max Speed (Off Road) - 48.3Front Armor (In mm) - 380Main Gun Type - SmoothCaliber (In mm) - 105Effective Range (In m) - 2500Max Rounds Per Minute - 8Total Rounds - 55Heat Rounds - YesSabot Rounds - YesT.O.W Rounds - NoM-113 Armored Personnel CarrierM-113 Armoured Personnel CarrierCrew - 2Weight (In Tons) - 11.2Length (In cm) - 486Engine Type - DieselRoad Range (In km) - 321Max Speed (On Road) - 64.4Max Speed (In Water) - 5.8Front Armor (In mm) - 38Main Gun Type - Machine GunCaliber (In mm) - 12.7Effective Range (In m) - 500Max Rounds Per Minute - N/ATotal Rounds - 1200Heat Rounds - NoSabot Rounds - NoT.O.W Rounds - NoM-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting VehicleM-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting VehicleCrew - 3Weight (In Tons) - 22.7Length (In cm) - 645Engine Type - DieselRoad Range (In km) - 483Max Speed (On Road) - 66Max Speed (Water) - 7.2Front Armor (In mm) - 60Main Gun Type - CannonCaliber (In mm) - 25Effective Range (In m) - 1000Max Rounds Per Minute - 100Total Rounds - 900Heat Rounds - NoSabot Rounds - NoT.O.W Rounds - 7M-901 Improved TOW VehicleM-901 Improved TOW VehicleCrew - 4Weight (In Tons) - 11.2Length (In cm) - 486Engine Type - DieselRoad Range (In km) - 321Max Speed (On Road) - 55Max Speed (Off Road) - N/AFront Armor (In mm) - 38Main Gun Type - noneCaliber (In mm) - N/AEffective Range (In m) - N/AMax Rounds Per Minute - N/ATotal Rounds - N/AHeat Rounds - NoSabot Rounds - NoT.O.W Rounds - 12T-62 Main Battle TankT-62 Main Battle TankCrew - 4Weight (In Tons) - 37.5Length (In cm) - 933Engine Type - DieselRoad Range (In km) - 450Max Speed (On Road) - 50Max Speed (Off Road) - N/AFront Armor (In mm) - 200Main Gun Type - SmoothCaliber (In mm) - 115Effective Range (In m) - 1500Max Rounds Per Minute - 3-5Total Rounds - 40Heat Rounds - YesSabot Rounds - YesT.O.W Rounds - NoT-72 Main Battle TankT-72 Main Battle TankCrew - 3Weight (In Tons) - 41Length (In cm) - 953Engine Type - DieselRoad Range (In km) - 450Max Speed (On Road) - 70Max Speed (Off Road) - N/AFront Armor (In mm) - 250Main Gun Type - SmoothCaliber (In mm) - 155Effective Range (In m) - 2000Max Rounds Per Minute - 6-8Total Rounds - 39Heat Rounds - YesSabot Rounds - YesT.O.W Rounds - NoBMP-2 Infantry VehicleBMP-2 Infantry VehicleCrew - 3Weight (In Tons) - 14.5Length (In cm) - 674Engine Type - DieselRoad Range (In km) - 500Max Speed (On Road) - 70Max Speed (Off Road) - N/AFront Armor (In mm) - 19Main Gun Type - Auto-CannonCaliber (In mm) - 30Effective Range (In m) - 1000Max Rounds Per Minute - N/ATotal Rounds - 40Heat Rounds - NoSabot Rounds - NoT.O.W Rounds - YesBTR-60 Armored Personnel CarrierBTR-60 Armoured Personnel CarrierCrew - 2Weight (In Tons) - 10.2Length (In cm) - 722Engine Type - PetrolRoad Range (In km) - 500Max Speed (On Road) - 80Max Speed (Off Road) - N/AFront Armor (In mm) - 9Main Gun Type - Machine GunCaliber (In mm) - 14.5Effective Range (In m) - 500Max Rounds Per Minute - N/ATotal Rounds - 500Heat Rounds - NoSabot Rounds - NoT.O.W Rounds - No[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Technocop</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Techno Cop is a run and gun game set in the near future. You play as a cop dressed in a red trench coat, who seeks to clear his town of all the criminal scum. The game consists of two parts; one driving-action segment and one sidescrolling-action segment. In the first part you drive around in your red Lamborghini and destroy hostile cars. In the sidescrolling segments, you somersault over gaps, use elevators and shoot lots of enemies until you reach the boss. After having killed or caught the villain, you have go back to your car and drive to the next mission. When the game first came out it drew political controversy for being considered graphic at the time and projecting violent police officers.  You have two types of ammo.  The first is a net, which captures enemies but has a fairly long reload between shots.  The second is a standard pistol.  What made this game controversial is not only that shooting people with the pistol results in blood, but you can shoot kids as well as criminals.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</plot>

			<title_clean>Terminator II - Judgemant Day</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a side-scrolling action shooter game for various home consoles and systems, published by LJN and Ocean in various regions. The game loosely follows the events of the movie of the same name, with the player assuming the role of the reprogrammed T-800 unit (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie) as he protects both John and Sarah Connor from the shape-shifting mimetic poly-alloy android the T-1000.This version should not be confused with the on-rails Arcade game of the same name, or its many home ports which were all named T2: The Arcade Game. Though both versions share some developers/publishers and are based on the same source material, they play very differently.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Terry's Big Adventure looks and feels somewhat similar to Mario's, being a side-scrolling platform game using stylised block graphics and lots of ledges to climb up and around. Terry is armed with a yo-yo which can be directed as a weapon by pushing the joystick as you hold down fire - an idea later repeated by Trolls. On this occasion the use of the yo-yo  causes Terry to recoil slightly, so be careful that this does not push him off a ledge or into the path of another enemy.[CR]There are 12 levels in total, incorporating many rivers to cross as well as hordes of hedgehogs, snails and similar to kill. Hidden bonus objects and time extensions can be found.  When you start a new game you start form the last level you reached, so you effectively have unlimited continues.</plot>

			<title_clean>Tetris</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the 1986 MS-DOS version of Tetris.Tetris was originally created by Alexey Pajitnov, who designed and programmed the game in June 1985 while working in the USSR at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science in Moscow. The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix "tetra", which means "four", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.[CR]Tetris Variants[CR]A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.[CR]IP Rights[CR]The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Tetris GiantTetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.Sega also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest licensed Tetris arcade machine.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Theatre of War</title_clean>
			<plot>Scenario is a turn-based strategy game set during World War I. The player's goal is to conquer the entirety of Europe. The game takes place on a map of Europe divided into a number of provinces. There are 4 players, each of which can be human or computer-controlled, and each player starts with 1 province and a small army in it. The rest of the provinces are independent countries, just waiting to be conquered...Armies consist of tanks, airplanes and ships. Each turn, the player can freely move their forces between their provinces or attack neighbouring provinces (though each tank, plane and ship can be moved only once per turn.) A ship automatically takes a number of tanks and airplanes when it is moved. When the player attacks a province, whether a neutral one or controlled by another player, the progress of the battle is shown. Of course, if the attacker emerges victorious by destroying the opposing army, they take over the country. If there's no army in that country, it can be taken over without combat at all. Producing new armies costs money, acquired from taxes paid by the empire's citizens. It is also possible to get cash by mining for raw materials (coal, iron or copper); their prices change each turn, but they usually yield a lot of profits - but raw materials eventually run out, and trying to mine a depleted resource is a waste of money (though the player can pay a 250.000 fee to make an analysis and see how much resources there is left in a province). Another way to earn money is to send ships to overseas colonies to get money from them. Producing armies requires first building factories; each factory produces a specific type of military units, and has a limit as to how many units it can make per turn. Fortifications can also be built in a province to make a defending army a bit stronger during enemy attacks. It is also possible to acquire an enemy province by providing the local revolutionaries with a hefty sum of money, allowing them to take over the province and make it a part of the player's empire. Each turn, a random event can happen, such as worker strikes (cannot dig for raw materials) or discovery of a gold mine (cash bonus). The player is sometimes given an opportunity to destroy a factory in an enemy province; to do this, a short arcade sequence must be completed, which involves quickly aiming and shooting five guards in the head before the time, or ammunition, runs out. </plot>

			<plot>Th!nk Cross is a Puzznic variant. In each of the 150 levels, there are a number of blocks with varying symbols or numbers on them. The player can move each block left or right and when two or more identical blocks are brought together, they vanish. The goal is to eliminate all stones within a time limit.The levels are shown from the side with applied physics, i.e. blocks fall down if pushed from a ledge. There are also various special level elements, e.g. conveyor belts, elevators or weak structure elements which can only bear one block. Passwords are rewarded all five levels and a "help" function can be used twice per level. It brings the level back to point zero without  a game over, which is useful when the player navigated into an unwinnable situation. After earning a certain amount of points, the player receives a bomb which can be used to kill off a block of choice.</plot>

The scenario is limited to the European theatre.[CR]The game is played in rounds of three months, split into several phases such as declaration of war, movement, battle and construction.[CR]You begin the game by declaring war. Which front you open up first will determine the further development of the war. Warring nations are split into two kinds  great military powers such as the allies and the axis, and neutral states.[CR]One resource to be househeld with is your gross national product. This is the resource that will be expended when you build up your armies, and eventually send them to war.[CR]The game has a multitude of scenarios, each with its own goals; just killing your enemy is not the best way to win, if at all.[CR]Just as in the board game, the action takes place on a hexagon map of Europe.</plot>

The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.[CR]The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.</plot>

			<plot>Thunderstrike is a 3d spaceship shooter set in the year 2238, using a non-textured polygon graphics engine. As a pilot in the "Ground Defense Games", you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).[CR]When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.[CR]When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.[CR]At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</plot>

			<plot>This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot.The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces.  It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events.  An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tiger Road (JP: Tora e no Michi) is a beat 'em up originally developed by Capcom and published by Romstar for the Arcade platform. The game has been ported to many home computers and consoles. Home computer versions were converted by US Gold for the European market, while the TurboGrafx-16 version (which was released in both Japan and the US) was developed by Advance Communication Company. The Arcade version was later added to Capcom's Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 compilation for PS2.Tiger Road is a Chinese martial arts-inspired brawler that often switches venues to flying stages and other non-traditional action levels, somewhat similar to Battletoads. The protagonist can find new weapons by destroying objects and will switch to them once they are collected, like Ghosts 'n Goblins's Sir Arthur, and the goal of each stage is to find the exit.

			<plot>Time Scanner is a pinball game. As usual, the goal is to keep the ball in the game by bouncing it back with the paddles. Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into twp parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are:Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes.Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a "collect ball" hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole.Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.The last table introduces Breakout elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.The first three tables can be freely selected and the last one is unlocked by beating the other three.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Start Screen of Time SoldiersGylend, the terrifying conqueror of galactic space, turned his attention towards earth. In an attempt to thwart his plans to conquer the planet, Yohan, Ben and five of the Earth Command Troopers tried to infiltrate Gylends stronghold and discover the source of his power, so that he could be defeated.Unfortunately they were discovered before they could successfully fullfil their mission. Gylend then turned five of the troopers into red gleaming energy balls and threw them into the endless void of time.Only Yohan and Ben were spared by the evil overlord, who told them that they would be given a chance to rescue their comrades. Should they be able to locate them in the different time zones and rescue them, they would also be given the opportunity to fight Gylend for the ownership of Earth![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B]Time Soldiers can be played in single player or in two player mode. The player starts the game with three lives. Anytime they are hit by a enemy or one of the projectiles they lose a life. After they have lost all three lives they can gain up to two continues by pressing the primary fire two times before the game over screen appears. It is a little odd why there are no normal continues in the game because this "secret" can be found in the manual, but this is probably how Time Soldiers rolls. The player can continue the game exactly where they died, but they lose all of the equipment they had. An advantage of the 2 player mode is that the player who died will automatically revive as long as the other one is still alive.StagesTo rescue all of the five missing troopers the player must pass through five different time zones. Four of them are set in the past and one of them is in the future. Interestingly, the player does not begin the game in the same era every time they play. It is always one of the earlier zones, though. And, as might be expected, they will never start the game in Gylend's stage...Each of the time zones is divided into three stages. At the end of each stage the player has to battle a Mid Boss.After he is defeated a portal opens which will bring the player to a different time zone. When reaching the stage where their comrade is located, they also have to fight the so-called Big Boss. Defeat him and one of the comrades will be saved.The time zones and the corresponding enemies are:Brokeratops and Bitekan from the Primitive Era.Primitive Era:BrokeratopsCryptogramPurtasaurBitekanAruma (Middle Boss)Ankirosaurus (Middle Boss)Big Brokera (Middle Boss)Tyrasaurus (Big Boss)Ancient Rome:Bow ManPharantasRoman SwordsmanRoman GhostMedusa (Middle Boss)Anubis (Middle Boss)Tri-Neck Dragon (Middle Boss)Minotaur (Big Boss)Medieval Japan:Fire Throwing SoldierKappa (River Monster)NinjaPiper MonkSamurai (Middle Boss)Tengu (Middle Boss)Dark Monk (Middle Boss)Kabuki (Big Boss)The Large Tank from World War 2.World War 2Wild GeesePrivateMIL-29 (Middle Boss)Ratto Willis (Middle Boss)T-87 (Middle Boss)Hainder (Middle Boss)Large Tank (Big Boss)Future WorldDisco FighterSpark ShooterA-LineManrasu (Middle Boss)Nike (MIddle Boss)Gorugo (Big Boss)Gylend the Conqueror.Gylend's WorldRideruGerondo-DGylend (The Conqueror)ExtrasSome of the normal enemies the player defeats will also leave extras behind which can be picked up.

			<plot>The game is a strategical puzzle action, where you have to eliminate the playfield filling it with the tiles of different colors until the time will be exhausted. Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes. The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.Finishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level. There are 30 levels available to play.</plot>

			<title_clean>Times of Lore</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Times of Lore is a top down, action RPG featuring three character classes, a simple dialogue system, and a seamless world with no load times which was a triumph for the time. A quest to recover three, powerful artifacts is the main focus of the game, although the player is free to explore the land and encounter its dangers without having to follow it. It's difficulty level, action-oriented gameplay, and simple dialogue made it easy for anyone to get into. It's relative simplicity made it an ideal starting point for newcomers to the RPG genre.    The real-time action of the gameplay has also invited comparisons to    Gauntlet.  The game also has the distinction of being Chris Roberts' (of   Wing Commander fame) first title for  Origin.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   The story of Times of Lore starts with the retelling of an old tale by a Grandfather to his grandchildren...  Long ago, before there ever was a High King, chaos ruled a land divided. It was then that the first of the Elden people arrived along the shore of the Great Sea. At first, the native people of the land attacked the newcomers, seeing them as a threat. After a century of war, the Kingdom of Albareth unified the land and began to prosper. The Elden earned the respect of the people that had once called them enemies and seven hundred years ago, an Elden prince was named the first High King of Albareth with the people's blessing.  He had also brought three powerful relics from the homeland of the Elden: the Tablet of Truth, the Foretelling Stones, and the Golden Medallion of Power. The Tablet allowed the king to answer any question of import to the kingdom and only an Elden of the purest blood were able to call upon it. The Warden of the Southern Marches was found worthy of keeping this great treasure.  The Foretelling Stones enabled the King to see places and times, aiding any who sought its wisdom. These the High King left with the Prior of Marabout, a great monastery built near Rhyder in the far North.  But it was the Medallion of Power that was the most sacred of these three. No High King can hold the throne without it, and its magical essence only recognizes those worthy of the title as a descendant of High King Strebor (Roberts, in reflection). The Medallion allowed the wielder to command entire armies as one force, but its strength was only as strong as the heart of the one who wore it. Therefore, only an Elden with kingly blood could bear it.  Peace reigned until the arrival of the Barbarians from the South. Ganestor was overrun and the armies of Albareth did all they could to break their march. Both armies fought each other for ten long years as High King Valwyn looked for a way to stop the bloodshed.    He then took the best of his forces and confronted the Barbarians in what would become known as the Battle of Ganestor, inflicting terrible losses on the Barbarians whose seemingly endless numbers continued to pour more soldiers into the field. It was a stalemate that neither side could break. The High King finally used the Medallion to pause the battle and parlay with Heidric, the Barbarian leader. Many days passed and at last, a treaty was hammered out.  Ganestor would go to the Barbarians, but in return, they were to swear fealty to the throne of Albareth. The two men grew to respect each other over time and in commemoration of the truce several years later, Valwyn presented Heidric with the Tablet of Truth. Heidric was also named the Warden of Ganestor and peace seemed guaranteed once again.  Valwyn was growing old and the Ten Year war had drained even more of his dwindling strength. Taking his child and the Medallion, he departed for the Elden homelands back across the sea to rest and recover his spirit, leaving the kingdom in the hands of his steward, Dariel.  Unfortunately for Albareth, Dariel proved to be less of an able ruler than Valwyn.  Many Elden lords did not agree with the truce signed with Heidric and had fostered hate for him and his people over the years since. With Valwyn gone and Dariel seen as a weak replacement, these Elden lords attacked Ganestor hoping to tear it from the grip of Heidric's son, Prince Avar.  So it is that Dariel remains as a prisoner within the city of Eralan, fearful of his enemies and unable to stop the growing chaos festering in the land. Orcs have also been sighted coming in from the North and with Albareth's own forces stretched thin, bandits freely rob travelers on the roads in between each city.   A savior was needed. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Starting the game presented a storybook that told the story of the kingdom of Albareth and its current troubles. Upon starting play, the character would be able to chose from one of three characters to represent them in the game:Stalwart Knight - armored and equipped with a swordFierce Valkyrie - fast and lightly armoredPowerful Barbarian - Very strong but no armor The main character was always fixed in the center of the screen and the adventure took place in both outdoor and indoor environments. Upon walking into a building or an underground area such as cave, the "top" of the area would cut away to show the player and their surroundings.  Saves were handled only at the inn after paying for a stay. This could make the game extremely difficult due to the size of the overland map and the number of dungeons on it. Dying so far from an inn would result in quite a bit of lost progress on the player's part.Unlike other traditional RPGs, there are no statistics to roll or assign in the game. There is no leveling involved. Health was represented by a candle that slowly burned down on being injured. Recovery was handled either by standing still (during which health would slowly recover) or through the use of certain potions. Item collection consisted of picking up potions, although only one of every type of potion was allowed to be carried. Money can also be gathered and used to purchase potions or better weapons.   Interacting with the environment, the interface displayed basic actions such as picking up objects, dropping them, a "look" command to examine things, and a "talk" option to engage NPCs in simple dialogue.  A day and night cycle as also integrated into the gameplay. Encounters at night were considerably more difficult than during the day. Enemies would spawn while the player was in motion.[CR]Combat[CR]The combat is in real-time with the player controlling the main character which is fixed in the center. The player would normally walk up to monsters and use the attack button to inflict damage. Monsters would drop gold, potions, or even items.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Herg's famous cartoon character is brought to life in this multi-stage action game, specifically based around the episode of the same name. In many details the story was similar to the real moon landings, then many years off. [CR]A more accurate title for the game would be 'Tintin Gets to the Moon', as reaching it is your challenge. The game is split into two distinct types of sections; the first of these involves guiding the rocket through space. Steer it to avoid contact with asteroids, and to collect eight red spheres. Yellow spheres boost energy, and so should be collected.[CR]This is followed by a platform-based battle, as the evil Captain Jurgen has tied up several crew members, planted time bombs, and started several fires. Use your extinguisher on Jurgen and the fires, and touch the bombs and crew members to solve those problems. Turn gravity off to reach the more troublesome bombs.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Brainies is a puzzle game with a simple goal: move each colored Brainy (Brainie?) to its correct marker in the time allotted. The player uses a cursor to move to a Brainy, pick them up, then move them to the right spot. The catch is that the Brainies block each other so puzzles sometimes require the player to move each Brainy many times in a level. A Brainy will also keep walking in one direction until they hit a wall or another Brainy. The goal is to use these limitations to direct each Brainy to their assigned markers before the time limit runs out.The game was released to many European home computers in 1991. It was later ported to the Super Nintendo in 1994 (1996 for the US version). Some of the European versions are known as Tiny Skweeks, alluding to the Skweek puzzle series.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.[CR]For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.[CR]The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key  a very useful option in tricky situations.[CR]Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</plot>

You control a bat at the bottom of the screen and must hit a ball upwards to hit bricks at the top of the screen to make them all disappear to move onto the next level. If the ball goes past your bat then it's a life lost. To help you there are icons that fall downwards when certain bricks are hit. These can help you in your game and include shooting lasers, ball sticking to the bat and extending the bat. There are shapes floating around the screen and although they can't hurt you they can make the ball bounce in a new direction. One or two players can play and each player has a turn when the other player loses a life. There are 33 levels and the first 16 can be chosen to play.</plot>

			<plot>Top Banana is a game synthesised from everything that was hip, cool and "in" during the early nineties. With members from the experimental sampling music group Coldcut in the development team, it aimed to look no worse than a contemporary MTV video, with a cool rave intro, crazy "sampled" graphics composed of random imagery and lots of aaaciiiiiid.What it all boils down to is a very simple platform game with very advanced graphics. You control a girl in a rave outfit who jumps through a series of platform worlds where you throw some love around in the form of hearts, which somehow ties into an environmentally conscious (the packaging was made out of recycled paper) theme where the enemies are representatives of big business. Also, similar to Rainbow Islands, a mass of water is slowly rising from below, so you must hurry upwards through the level. The graphics make the game look not quite like anything else, as though the graphics artist just inverted all the tiles and put them in a random order.Keeping with the 90s sentiment of "information wants to be free", the samples and sprites are kept uncompressed on the disks, for everyone to edit according to their own tastes.</plot>

			<plot>Torvak, a man with the typical barbarian looks, comes back to his homeland after an exile of five years. But instead of a warm greeting, he receives a telepathic message that an evil necromancer took over. So of course the next course of action is to travel through five levels while killing all of the necromancer's creatures on the way, including an especially nasty one at each level's end. The levels are generally side-scrolling, but sometimes underground passages can be reached via holes. This has no significant effect, though. The gameplay consists of using the four melee weapons which three moves each to get rid of the enemies without dying from their hits. Helpful power ups can be found when destroying parts of the scenery. Besides health refreshments and invincibility, there are also permanent upgrades for Torvak available, e.g. an extended health bar, greater speed or magical enchantments for the weapons. When an upgraded weapon is equipped, a powerful spell can be unleashed by holding the fire button.</plot>

			<plot>Doug Quaid is a mild-mannered construction worker with a gorgeous wife in an apartment on futuristic Earth.  Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation ("cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing"). However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.[CR]Total Recall for the Amiga and Atari ST has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars.  The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels.  Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player can duck to avoid bullets, and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.[CR]Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed.  The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile "boss" vehicle to end the level.  Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.</plot>

			<plot>This game offers a simulation of the popular British Touring Car Championship of the early 90s. Four different cars are featured, from Toyota, BMW, Nissan and Vauxhall, which make up the 24-car grid. The game features accurate re-creations of Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Donington Park and Oulton Park. You can practice each track, or do single races or championships, over 3,5 or 7 laps, although you always start 10th on the grid with no qualifying. The race is viewed from above and behind your car, similarly to the Lotus Challenge series.</plot>

			<title_clean>Toyota Celica GT Rally</title_clean>
			<plot>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.[CR]As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.[CR]The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</plot>

			<plot>Transarctica is based on a French sci-fi novel, "La Compagnie de glaces" (The Ice Company), set in a world where humanity has inadvertently created a perpetual cloud cover; blocking out the sun and causing a nuclear winter. Humans eke out a living at secluded outposts while packs of wolves and herds of mammoths roam the vast frozen tundras now that make up the world's geography. A network of heavily armored trains and well-maintained railroads, run by the tyrannical Viking Union, is the only hope the remaining humans have of supplies and transportation. The player controls the crew of rebels whom have recently emancipated one of these trains from the Union: the eponymous Transarctica.  Gameplay is focused on two modes: Management, where the player controls all aspects of their train's size, mobility and trade as they stop at various locations in Eurasia; and Combat, where the player must use the resources of the Transarctica to repel Viking Union trains and other rivals. The player must constantly purchase, mine or loot their main fuel source: coal.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Transylvania is a graphical text adventure game, where the player must rescue a princess from a murderous vampire. Similar to earlier On-Line (the predecessor to Sierra) graphical adventures such as Wizard and the Princess, Transylvania features a rendered graphic of the player's location, and a text interface.The original Commodore and Atari releases' popularity lead to ports for a variety of computers in the years following, as well as two well-received sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Werewolf blocks the playerThe player's character is controlled through a basic text parsing engine, capable of understanding commands in the 'verb-object' format, such as "get rock" or "open door". Additionally, movement is accomplished through compass directions, or abbreviations thereof.The King of Transylvania has engaged the player to rescue princess Sabrina from a vampire. Unique among most text adventures of the time, there is a time limit, which allows the player a finite number of turns before the game abruptly ends.Along the way, the player must face numerous object-based puzzles, a Warewolf, an alien spacecraft, and other obstacles. Rescuing princess Sabrina leads to the final scene, where the thankful king alerts the player to his other missing daughter; the player sneaks out in the night, to avoid another adventure.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Later Polarware games were written using the Comprehend parsing engine, which is capable of parsing full Infocom-style sentences. The success of Comprehend lead Polarware to re-release Transylvania in a Comprehend edition, including updated graphics, expanded and new puzzles, and the more advanced parsing engine. The Atari ST and Amiga versions are Comprehend edition, with no prior versions. Transylvania was one of Penguin's more popular early graphical text adventures, and lead to two less popular sequels, The Crimson Crown, and Vanquish the Night. The final sequel includes digitized voicework.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>(From Infocom Home Page fan site)[CR]You're neither an adventurer nor a professional trill-seeker. You're simply an American tourist in London, enjoying a relaxing stroll through the famous Kensington Gardens. When World War III starts and the city is vaporized moments after the story begins, you have no hope of survival. Unless you enter another time, another place, another dimension. Escaping the destruction of London is not the end of your problems, but rather the beginning of new, more bizarre riddles. You'll find yourself in an exotic world teeming with giant fly traps, strange creatures, and other inconveniences. Time and space will behave with their own intricate and mischievous logic. You'll visit fantastic places and acquire curious objects as you seek to discover the logic behind your newfound universe. And if you can figure out the patter of events, you'll wind up in the New Mexico desert, minutes before the culmination of the greatest scientific experiment of all time: the world's first atomic explosion, code-named Trinity.</plot>

			<plot>After recreating the original board game as closely as possible with the first licensed game, Oxford did something different with the sequel. Each player now controls a spaceship, and the overall aim is to convince the Elders of the planet Genus  to accept your people's plan to colonize it.The Elders are all located in different parts of the galaxy, and can only be reached by travelling through the galaxy answering questions correctly, and answering a specific question once you get there. As a result, the gameplay isn't vastly different from the original. The six question categories are the same as the original, and there are 50 levels of question to clear, but the big difference is that the question category is random, so players who are only knowledgeable in one or two areas are no longer at an advantage.</plot>

			<title_clean>Trivial Pursuit - Genus Edition</title_clean>
			<plot>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</plot>

			<plot>Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer Ren Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. [CR]After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.</plot>

			<title_clean>Turbo Outrun</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Part of the OutRun series, Turbo OutRun eschews the non-linear branching routes of its predecessor Out Run in favour of a longer linear route across the United States, from New York to Los Angeles. There are several new game-play additions which help to further differentiate Turbo OutRun from the original.A turbo boost greatly increases the car's speed when engaged. It must be used sparingly, however, as overuse will cause the engine to overheat, rendering the turbo useless until the engine has cooled, which indicated by an on-screen 'Overheat' meter.Weather conditions are a new innovation, with both snow and rain having an adverse effect on driving conditions and car handling. Road surfaces also vary greatly in quality, with sand, oil, speed bumps, safety barriers, standing water and other debris all adding to the challenge.Another new addition is the ability to upgrade the car, possible upon completion of every four of the game's sixteen stages. Available power-ups are an improved turbo boost, a more powerful engine, or better gripping tires. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>Turbo ST is a racing game, which does not rely on hundreds of racing tracks, but directly booting into a track editor. You can change the two predefined tracks or create new ones. These can be loaded and saved as normal files, so are exchangeable easily. The track elements contain 45- and 90-degree curves, vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines.There are three themes to assign to the tracks, which alter the graphical representation in game: Rising Sun, High Noon and Alps. The graphic comes with occasionally zooming sprites beside the bitmap road, with the background picture scrolling left and right. There are no AI drivers, so playing the game alone you can only race against the high score.Up to four players can race against the time in a hot-seat mode on the created or loaded tracks. You car have four gears, switching up and down easily with the joystick. The score is always starting at 9999 and counting downwards with time and you also receive a penalty on the score for crashes.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Turrican is a 1990 "run and gun" shooter/platformer akin to something like Contra. The player, as the bio-mechanical mutant warrior The Turrican, must make their way across a semi-non-linear world and defeat a boss before they can move onto the next world. The Turrican can change its weapon type, but any weapon besides the default will require finite ammo which must be found in the environment first.Turrican was originally developed for the Commodore 64 by a single programmer/designer, Manfred Trenz, but the Amiga and Genesis conversions are the best known versions. This is due in part to the music composed by Chris Huelsbeck for those versions. Turrican also saw releases for the Game Boy and TurboGrafx-16. Super Turrican (NES) is a composite game partly based on stages in the original Turrican and its sequel Turrican 2. Numerous homebrew attempts have been made to reboot Turrican for the modern era.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story (like found in the home computer manuals) is fast told: A long time ago the three-headed creature called Morgul was banished by the hero Devolon to an unknown dimension. The reason for this feat was that Morgul tormented the mankind with fears and nightmares. After Morgul's banishment fear and sleepless nights disappeared out of peoples lives. But since lately the people suffer again from a serious state of dread and fear and the nightmares come back. The apprehension is great that Morgul has returned to his kingdom. So armed with the latest weapons and technical equipment the player has to find and destroy Morgul in his kingdom.An alternate story is given in the Genesis/TurboGrafx-16 versions: Here is Morgul (Multiple-Organism-Unit-Link) a powerfull ecosystem generation network which the early colonists used to render the world of Alterra inhabitable. After a cataclysmic quake all system interface functions were severed and Morgul rebelled. He twisted all lifeforms of Alterra to his brutal, destructive purposes. To recapture Alterra genetic scientists created Turrican, a bio-engineered mutant warrior. Turricans task is to eliminate hostile organisms from Alterras five colonies and to destroy the three faces of Morgul.[CR]</plot>

The brawls in the game tended to be somewhat quick thanks to the one-hit kill weapons, and you had to keep an eye on both your health and water meter. If one of them depletes, you're dead. A somewhat intuitive thing for it's time was how the game gave you a hint everytime you died, often encouraging you to give it just one more try, followed by another.Developed by the same company behind the Last Ninja games, System 3, it's hard not to draw comparisons between the two and while Tusker is a tad more obscure it's still a heck of a game. Noteworthy is as per usual the amazing music, especially for the c64 version. Composed by Matt Gray of Last Ninja 2 fame, with his heavy drums and deep guitar distortion - it really gets you in the mood for some Indiana Jonesesque action and often you'd find yourself replaying the game just to hear the music one more time.Fun little notice at the end is that Tusker featured a puzzle where you put rocks on a huge scale to open a door. Some time later Lucas Art's pc game "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis" featured a similar puzzle and it's fun to speculate whether or not this was a coincidence.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]U.N. Squadron is a title based on a manga series from Japan called Area 88, which is also the game's Japanese title. It was originally released on the CPS arcade hardware by Capcom in 1989 and later ported to the SNES. The game features the same characters as the manga, and their mission is to stop a terrorist group known as Project 4.Carrier Air Wing is the spiritual sequel to U.N. Squadron and was released on the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom in 1990.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are three different playable characters in both the arcade version and Super Nintendo version.Shin KazamaThe three playable characters and their planes.Pilots an F-20 Tigershark. His weapons fire forward only, but at a quicker pace than the others. Shin and his plane is also the most balanced out of the three. In the original Area 88 storyline, Shin is the central protagonist. In the SNES version, Shin upgrades his main gun at a faster rate than the other pilots.Mickey SimonPilots an F-14 Tomcat. His weapons can also only fire forward, but are larger and do more damage. They are however a bit slower. In the SNES version his name is spelled Mickey Scymon; Mickey also is awarded double ammunition bonuses when picking up a hidden ammo cache.Greg GatesPilots an A-10 Thunderbolt. His weapon has smaller forward fire than the others, but it also fires a second stream downward at a 45 degree angle. In the SNES version, Greg recovers from damage faster than the other pilots.[CR]Weapons Shop[CR]During gameplay, the player earns money for each destroyed enemy plane or vehicle wich can be used to buy special weapons or defenses to be used in the next level. After each level, any unused weapons are converted back into money.In the Super Nintendo version, the player can also buy a different aircraft, of which there are 6 available.F-8E Crusader - Starter aircraft.F-20 TigersharkF-14D TomcatA-10 Thunderbolt IIYF-23 Stealth RayF-200 Efreet[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Arcade versionBulpupBulpup IIPhoenixFalconSuper ShellSuper Shell IIBomb IIBig BoyNapalmNapalm IIAfter buying or dismissing additional weapons, players can also purchase one of three different defense enhancements.Energy Tank - More life to the lifebar.Shield - Absorbs some damage from enemy fire and collisions.Super Shield - Same as shield, but absorbs more.Super Nintendo versionCluster ShotBombPhoenixNapalmFalconGunpodSuper ShellSailing MissileThunder LaserBulpupMegaCrush[CR]Stages and Bosses[CR]Arcade versionShin fighting the level 2 boss from the arcade version of U.N.

Depending on the stage, the player encounters land, sea and air units. Some red enemies drop a POW, which is used to upgrade the main gun of the players aircraft. The POWs come in green, blue or yellow and each color is worth a different amount of points. Special weapons on the other hand cannot be upgraded.The players aircraft can take some hits before it is destroyed and has a small period of time where it is invulnerable after each hit.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]It's a little known fact that U.N. Squadron was used in the comic strip Computer Warrior, in which a boy called Bobby Patterson found a secret code which let him play computer games 'for real'. The strip to some degree turned into a marketing tool for publisher U.S.Gold, now known as Eidos, as it became solely their published games that were used as the basis of the 'real game playing' story arcs. Other games included Black Tiger and Zak McCracken.As such, the stories and characters from Area 88 may well be the only IP to be a manga adapted to video game, westernized with a new title to then be adapted into a comic book story. Perhaps ironically, the hero from Area 88 was recast as a traitorous villain in the U.N. Squadron Computer Warrior storyline.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Ultima II</title_clean>
			<plot>Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress continues with the first Ultima's combination of fantasy and sci-fi elements and adds something new - time travel. Like its predecessor, Ultima II predates the foundation of Origin Systems Inc and was published by Sierra On-Line. Unlike the first Ultima game, Ultima was never re-released as a stand alone game by Origin, although it was republished several times in various Ultima collections, although because these versions were missing map files, they were never winnable without patching.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Ultima 2 is very similar to Ultima 1. The game is still split between a 2-D overworld , 2-D towns on separate views, 3-D dungeon crawling, and a simple space simulation. Unlike Ultima 1, however, the 2-D towns can occupy more than one screen, and there is more than one overworld. The different overworlds represent different time periods (accessed through time gates) or even different planets. Weapons, armor, vehicles, and spells are still purchased, although they can also be found in dungeons and towers (dungeons that go up rather than down). Unlike Ultima 1, no item can be sold.Space gameplay is much simpler than in Ultima 1. Furthermore, there is no space combat in Ultima II. In space, the player character still moves in the four cardinal directions, and all of the letters of the alphabet are used as commands. There are no enemies to fight nor any 2-D screen. Once the player blasts off, he simply sees the classic "flying stars" screen and has the option to "hyperjump" to other planets. All of the planets of the solar system are accessible, and each offers a different 2-D overworld, although some planets cannot be landed on. Each "hyperjump" consumes a "tri-lithium" crystal (that's one more lithium than in Star Trek!) which can be found in dungeons. Other than the Planet X, there is no real reason for the player go to any of the other planets, however.Likewise, other than collecting tri-lithium, there is no reason to go into the dungeons. Special items like "Blue Tassels", "Brass Buttons" and "Coins" can be acquired by defeating enemies and are required to sail frigates, fly the airplane, and stop time, respectively.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Ultima II takes place on Earth rather than Sosaria, the setting for most of the other Ultima games. The premise is that Mondain's apprentice, Minax, used the mastery over time discovered in Ultima I to create a series of silver Time Doors connecting different places and eras. Garriott later commented that the concept of Time Doors was taken from the Terry Gilliam film "Time Bandits". Minax's realm was the Time of Legends, the most ancient era which consisted of a single continent and very difficult enemies. The other eras were "Pangea", "BC", "AD", and the "Aftermath", a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by the wars unleashed by Minax's millenial machinations. The protagonist must travel to the post-apocalyptic world and get an airplane to fly to Russia and get the rocket. Once in space, the protagonist must fly to Planet X and get Enilo's Quicksword and Father Antos' ring. Then, when sufficiently leveled-up, the player can travel back to the Time of Legends, find Minax's castle in the center of the map, and chase the enchantress around, attacking her with the Quicksword and surviving her force-fields unscathed because of the ring. When she finally dies the game is over.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Because of the simplistic plot and gameplay, Ultima II is widely considered the weakest game in the series. It is also the hardest of the nine main games to fit into the overall continuity because it takes place on Earth, although since it involves time travel, it is possible to say that the events of Ultima II (other than the protagonist showing up in the Time of Legends and killing Minax) simply never happened in the timeline created after Minax's death. After Ultima II, Garriott moved the game towards a more solid fantasy setting in Ultima III, eliminating the laser guns and space ships.One concept that was carried on, however, are the Time Doors, which are predecessors of the iconic Moongates of the later games.[CR]Commands[CR]In addition to the four arrows moving your character in the specifed direction, the follow keys are used:A - Attack (direction)B - BoardC - CastD - DescendE - EnterF - FireG - GetH - HyperI - Ignite torchJ - JumpK - KlimbL - LaunchM - Magic spell ready (#)N - Negate timeO - Offer gold (direction)P - PassQ - Quit and saveR - Ready weapon (#)S - Steal (direction)T - Transact (direction)U - Unlock (direction)V - ViewW - Wear armor (#)X - eXitY - Yell (text)Z - Inventory[CR]Compatibility[CR]This game can be played on modern Windows operating systes with an emulator like DOSBox.[CR]Availability[CR]The game is available on gog.com as part of the package Ultima 1+2+3.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Ultima III - Exodus</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima III: Exodus is the third and final game of what would be known as the "First Trilogy" of the Ultima Series, the "Three Ages of Darkness" in which the goal of the game was to defeat an evil overlord. In this game the "evil wizard" is Exodus, part monster, part machine. It is unclear what exactly Exodus is supposed to look like. In the game itself he/it looks like four sparkly squares, although in later games (particularly Ultima VI and VII) he is depicted as a demon similar to the one on the box cover. Ultima III was also the first Ultima game published by the newly founded Origin Systems Inc rather than Sierra On-Line. It features a much more consistent setting and tone than the previous two games, which combined sci-fi and fantasy elements.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ultima III is the first Ultima game to include a party system, a hallmark of the series until abandoned in Ultima VIII. Whereas in later games the player creates and takes control of one character (the Avatar) and then has others join his (or her) party, in Ultima III the play can create any number of characters and give them a wide assortment of races and classes. At the beginning of any given gaming session, the player could then select up to four of the characters and enter the world with them. Characters would keep the equipment and experience they had gained even when they were removed from the party, and so in theory the player could level-up more than four characters and pick the best four for a given situation. This feature allowed for a peculiar exploit in which the player could create any number of "dummy" characters and transfer their starting money and equipment to the players he or she really wanted to use and so begin in a better financial position than the designers intended. In addition, if a character was killed in the game, his or her dead state was immediately saved, regardless of whether the player "quits and saves."Ultima III maintains the 2-D world map, the 2-D towns, and the 3-D dungeons of the previous games, and the entire party is represented by a single icon (at least in the non-console versions) on the world and town maps. Unlike in the previous games, however, combat in Ultima III (including combat in dungeons) takes place on a separate 2-D screen on which each member of the party is represented as a separate character. The enemies also travel in groups, although in Ultima III each group only consists of one kind of monster. Interestingly enough, Ultima III included as many as three different variations for each type of monster.Like the later games, Ultima III takes places primarily on one super-continent, although it is still Sosaria and not Britannia. It also features moongates, which allow instananeous travel to fixed places on the map, and includes Dawn, a city which is only visible (and accessible) during certain phases of the moon.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In order to destroy Exodus, the party of adventurers must collect different marks that allow them to pass through the barriers protecting the demon. They must also collect four cards, Sol, Moon, Love, and Death. The cards are found in shrines in the lost land of Ambrosia, which is accessed by taking a ship into a whirlpool. Incidentally, the shrines also increase the players strength, wisdom, dexterity, and intelligence. Once they have collected the marks, the Exotic weapons and the cards, the adventures can sail up the Giant Earth serpent, yell the magic word, and sail up to Exodus' castle. Inside the castle the floor itself will attack them before they can find the machine and insert the cards that will destroy it.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The party system and the more serious fantasy setting of Ultima III definitely set the stage for the later Ultima games and many other computer role playing games. It is the last Ultima game in which the primary quest is to destroy an evil wizard-type. Later games would move in more complicated directions.[CR]Compatability[CR]This game can be played on modern Windows operating systes with an emulator like DOSBox.[CR]Availability[CR]The game is available on gog.com as part of the package Ultima 1+2+3.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar is the fourth entry in Richard Garriott's long-running and influential Ultima series of role playing games. Released in 1985 for the Apple II and then for the Commodore 64 and the IBM PC, Ultima IV departed from the "kill the evil wizard" plot of the earlier games of the series and encouraged the player to complete the Quest of the Avatar by mastering eight virtues and finding the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay in Ultima IV is not substantially different from Ultima III. However, Ultima IV introduces the concept of virtue as a foundation that governs the player's identity and progress. The player creates their protagonist at the start of the game by answering a series of questions about what he or she would do in a morally ambiguous situation. The player's answers determine which of the eight virtues he or she is most closely aligned to, and then the player begins the game with a character of the class which represents that virtue. The player's representative class and virtue also determine the city in which the player starts the game.There are eight virtues in the game, each represented by a class, a city, and a dungeon. The virtues themselves are built on the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. In each city, the player encounters a character of the class representative of the city's virtue, that under the right circumstances can join the player's party for a maximum total of eight party members.Inspiration for the eight virtues and three principles is found in a number of sources, including Buddhism and Hinduism, and as Richard Garriott himself said, the Wizard of Oz.The VirtuesVirtueFromCityDungeonClassHonestyTruthMoonglowDeceitMageCompassionLoveBritainDespiseBardValorCourageJhelomDestardFighterJusticeTruth and LoveYewWrongDruidSacrificeLove and CourageMinocCovetousTinkerHonorTruth and CourageTrinsicShamePaladinSpiritualityTruth, Love, and CourageSkara BraeHythlothRangerHumilityNoneNew MaginciaStygian AbyssShepherdConversationsThe conversation system is built on the foundation found in Ultima III, allowing the player to engage with NPCs with the key words "name", "job", and "health" and then by repeating phrases from the NPC's speech. In console versions of the game, text entry is replaced with a list of conversation topics that the player can choose from.CombatCombat is similar to Ultima III, but now spells require reageants which must be purchased (or found) and mixed in advance of combat. When the player enters a battle encounter, the player can choose to move party members individually one square per turn, cast magic, or attack from melee or long range (if the party members are appropriately equipped). There is also an "Auto" option that allows the computer to pick the action that the party member will take.ExplorationWhile exploring the overworld, the player has access to the moongates; magical gates that were introduced in Ultima III. The availability of these gates are dependent on the phases of the two moons, which determine which gates are currently open and their destinations. However, unlike Ultima III, the game does not feature an "underworld" like Ambrosia.Dungeon exploration in Ultima IV continues to use first-person, 3D hallways, but now also features rooms depicted from an overhead view as well.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is tasked by Britannia's Lord British to become an Avatar by reaching enlightenment in each of the eight virtues. The player's standing in each of the virtues is determined by actions taken during gameplay. Positive influences include refraining from stealing (i.e.: Not opening treasure chests found in towns or castles), giving gold to beggars and blood (Hit Points) to healers, meditating, answering NPCs' questions properly, not fleeing from combat, and letting non-evil creatures encountered during combat flee.Once a player has reached the required level in a given virtue (the seer Hawkwind in Castle Britannia keeps the player appraised of his or her virtue) he or she must meditate at the shrine corresponding to the virtue. When the player has completed this task for all eight virtues, he or she is ready to take on the Abyss to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.To accomplish this final task, the player must use eight colored stones (one found in each of the eight dungeons) to find the three parts of a key. Once the key is acquired, the player must then descend into the eight levels of the Abyss. Once the player has reached the bottom of the Abyss, he or she must answer a series of questions. If the player answers any of these questions incorrectly, the player character is warped back to the surface world and forced to navigate the Abyss again from the start. Should the player succeed and answer all of the questions correctly, he or she obtains the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the Avatar.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Ultima IV created the foundation of the rest of the Ultima series. All of the subsequent games would take place in or in relation to the world of Britannia and would reinterpret the virtues and the basic structure of the world. In later games, Richard Garriott would relativize the "goody two-shoes" story of Ultima IV by showing the unintended consequences of this single-minded quest for goodness. The antagonist of Ultima V would impose a totalitarian regime based on the virtues. It would be revealed that by taking the Codex from the bottom of the Abyss, the Avatar set into motion the destruction of the Gargoyles' world, and that by becoming the Avatar he or she spawned an evil alter-ego, the Guardian.The story of Ultima IV is extremely open-ended. The moongates allow the player to access any area of the game from the beginning, and the virtues and dungeons can be tackled in any order, except for the game-ending Abyss. The open-ended nature of the game would give way to a more tightly scripted story in later games.[CR]NES Version[CR]A version of Ultima IV entitled Ultima: Quest of the Avatar was made for the NES. The game's graphics were completely redrawn in a style similar to that of Japanese RPGs of the era such as the Dragon Quest series, and certain gameplay systems were streamlined for better playability on a console, rather than a PC with a keyboard. Otherwise, the game's structure and content are largely identical to the PC version. This version of the game was developed by Japanese company Infinity, which would go on to adapt the first two Populous games for Super Famicom and the Sharp X68000, and was published by Pony Canyon.[CR]Availability[CR]As of September 2011, Ultima IV is available at Good Old Games. It has also been released as part of the "Ultima 4+5+6" package.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Boxart showing an artpiece of the avatar.Ultima V, on the heels of the moral and technological breakthrough Ultima IV, has that King Arthur quality to it. It's been 2 years in your world(20 in Britannia) and someone named Blackthorn has usurped the throne after Lord British has disappeared. LB has been spotted at marshes some times although Blackthorn has persecuted any who say so as sacreligious. While LB was ruling the Avatar's eight virtues were expounded and practiced to make Britannia more wealthy, but now there are high taxes and martial law and Blackthorn has twisted the eight laws to form a police state. He even wants to figure out the mantras and the secrets to the Codex and the now sealed-off dungeons. Your object is to rid Britannia of the menace he and possible accomplices pose to Britannia.Iolo and Shamino realize the kingdom is trouble and call on the Avatar of legend to come back. He does, but as he is summoned through the magic moongate three Shadowlords appear and one throws a bolt into Shamino, who is left on the edge of death. The three heroes retreat to Iolo's hut deep in the woods, where they hope to let Shamino recuperate.Title screenYou'll need to get Lord British's artifacts, the Sandalwood Box, visit eight shrines and solve their quests (need to get the mantras too), get eight words of power to open the dungeon, and find Lord British. You begin as an avatar, but can lose the status by harming virtues. In the game this loss of Avatar status is shown by important clues being withheld. For example, in Britain, you won&#8217;t receive the password for opening the dungeon Despise if you haven't followed the path of the Avatar. The game now also has day and night cycles. In the night, the gates to most towns are closed and the people living there mostly lay in their beds although guards still patrol.OverworldUnderworldOne of the new improvements is the magic and combat system. In a combat situation you have a cursor which you can use to attack in any direction. That cursor will remain on the selected monster as long as you wish. That doesn&#8217;t mean combat is easy since you only get 30 hit-points, more when a new character level has been achieved, while monster magic capabilities and sheer numbers have increased. Magical spells are now (and in further Ultimas too) divided into 8 cycles. The higher the level of the spell caster, the more magic they can use.Great graphics for that time[CR]Availability[CR]The game is available at gog.com and is part of the "Ultima 4+5+6" package.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Ultima VI - The False Prophet</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima VI: The False Prophet is the third game in the second trilogy of the Ultima series, and the sixth (or possibly seventh) title to be released in the series. Ultima VI is notable for its single-scale world, in which cities blend seamlessly into the overworld, its strong moral sense, and its unstructured, non-linear gameplay -- a harbinger of what would later be called sandbox games.The Ultima VI engine would see use in the Worlds of Ultima series, which took place outside the main Ultima universe.Ultima VI was the final Ultima to see release on a wide variety of personal computer platforms, ranging from the C64 to the Atari ST, to the Amiga, FM Towns, PC98, X68K, and the PC, and years later on the SNES. Ultima VI was the first Ultima game not available on the Apple II.[CR][B]Background:[/B][CR]In Ultima VI, as in the previous two Ultima games, the player assumes the role of the Avatar, the embodiment of virtue and hope for the lands of Britannia. The game begins with the Avatar on Earth, enjoying a computer game, when a moongate suddenly appears. They enter through it, only to find themselves in the middle of a ritual sacrifice conducted by the winged, demonic-looking race known as Gargoyles. Although the Avatar is bound to the altar, and all appears lost, their companions -- Iolo. Shamino, and Dupre -- appear and free him. They then find themselves back in Lord British's castle, where they discover that the shrines of the virtues are under attack by the Gargoyles. The Avatar is tasked with freeing the shrines and discovering the nature of the Gargoyle invasion.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Similarly to other Ultimas, they are free to build their character, via stat points, in any way they wish. The Avatar is capable of using all weapons and spells in the game; however by increasing either STR, DEX, or INT, either melee, ranged, or magic attacks will be increased in effectiveness.Like other games in the series, the Avatar gathers a party to fight alongside them. They start off with three members, Iolo the Bard, Shamino the Ranger, and Dupre the Knight, but they can take any number of different characters with them, each of which have their own stats and uses. While the Avatar is the main character of the game, it is possible to take control over individual characters at times (which can have strategic uses), although the player cannot talk to other NPCs unless they are controlling the Avatar.As a sandbox-style game, Ultima VI lets the player do things different ways. There is not set order to completing objectives or visiting dungeons. There are a number of optional areas to visit and weapons to obtain. It is easy to miss things unless they explore every area. There is no level gating -- the player can explore the entire world from the get go. Ultima VI has a handful of travel options -- in addition to running, the Avatar can buy a horse, a boat, or ride a raft.The Avatar can rob stores, steal from the bank, and kill NPCS. They can kill a farmer's cow for meat, or milk it for milk to churn into butter. Take flour, and bake bread with it. Buy a ship and explore, or kill the shipwright and steal all his deeds. Ultima VI had a large number of what would now be called crafting opportunities, in which the player can take items gathered from the world and combine them to create something new.Although the player has a great deal of freedom, Ultima VI has, in the background and hidden from the player, something called Karma. Stealing or unprovoked killing decrease karma, while doing certain missions increases it. It is not possible to complete the game if the player's karma is too low.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameLocationSTRDEXINTMagicNotesBeh Lembefore Hythloth dunegon232426GargoyleBlainwith Gypsy band162118Gypsy jugglerGornunder Sutek's isleFighterGwennoMinoc1821179Bard, scholar and Iolo's wifeJaanaYewDruid and healerJuliaMinoc211817TinkererKatrinaNew Magincia191616ShepherdLeonnaMoonglow151518FighterLeodonMoonglow1519157FighterSeggallionSerpent's Hold282120Fighter.

The magic cost of each spell corresponds to its circle; so a fourth circle spell will cost four magic points.[CR]Reagents[CR]Using magic in Ultima 6 requires that the spell caster has the proper reagents on hand. Reagents may be found in certain areas, or purchased from vendors.The table below lists the areas where reagents may be gathered, as well as their price from various shops.NameHarvesting LocationHoranceNicodemusRudyomXiaoZoltanBlack Pearl34Blood Moss3233Garlic1132Ginseng1231Mandrake526Nightshade231Spider Silk11232Sulpherous Ash22131[CR]Cheats[CR]Ultima VI included a full cheat menu, allowing the Avatar to teleport anywhere in the game, spawn any item, and modify internal game state. To access it, the Avatar must talk to Iolo and speak the following words:spamspamspamhumbugAfter doing this, the cheat/debug menu will appear. Using these cheats does not affect the outcome of the game (assuming of course that the player does not alter the game flags or karma).[CR]Availability[CR]The game is nowadays available at Good Old Games (Gog.com) in a package with Ultima 4 and 5, and has been made playable on modern computers.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>The Ultimate Arena</title_clean>
			<plot>The story of the game is inspired by popular games of the same time, such as Speedball and Smash T.V.: In the not-too-distant future, the most popular television show lets contestants battle it out in an all-out fighting match called the Ultimate Arena.[CR]What this turns out to be is a man-versus-man fighting game with digitised graphics, which was  la mode in American coin-ops at the time, such as Pit-Fighter and Mortal Kombat, complete with sprays of blood for every hit. On the Atari, the sprites aren't quite as large as in arcade games, though.[CR]At the start of a one-player game, two characters are available to play with: Terry from France and Sandy from London. All seven characters are available to choose from in two-player mode.[CR]Each player has the usual assortment of 18 jumps, kicks and punches, most of which are easily executed with a normal Atari joystick, as well as a few special moves. Some carry weapons, while some can fire energy bolts. Instead of the common best-out-of-three system, sudden death is enforced, so a opponent must be beaten on the first attempt. If you do so, another stands in line. Being pushed into a corner is also more dangerous than other similar games, since the ringside is electrified. Stay close to the centre of the arena, or you will be burnt to a crisp.[CR]Released at the far end of the Atari's commercial life, Ultimate Arena is notable for being one of few STE-only games, which makes the digitised sounds and graphics more natural than had it been a normal ST game.</plot>

			<plot>The Ultimate Ride is a first-person motorcycle racing game featuring six Japanese bikes to choose from. The player participates in races (either with our without qualifying lap) and tries to win them. While not a simulation, the game's controls are more on the realistic side, requiring the player to drive carefully with the powerful machines given.The most important aspect of the game are the courses: there are six traditional courses modeled after real-life ones and six which lead over countrysides. On those the player also has to worry about obstacles like animals on the road or other vehicles (there is no oncoming traffic, though). The only customization options for the bikes are the choice between manual or automatic gears and three tires which should be chosen dependent on the course and weather conditions. There is also an editor to design new courses.</plot>

			<plot>Under Pressure is 2D side scrolling arcade game. The player controls a robot (he is trapped inside) and tries to rescue kidnapped gal. Gameplay is simplistic - he goes into right side, avoid obstacles like lasers barriers, and kill alien creatures. Sometimes he needs to hurry - for example, when the floor collapses. Killed enemies drop shells, the player can collect them for new weapons.Game uses big animated sprites, for this reason, the player sees only the immediate environment.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Uninvited is a  point-and-click adventure game developed by ICOM Simulations and published by MindScape (the NES version was developed byKemco/Seika). It makes extensive use of windows to store inventory items and commands, similar to ICOM's other MacVenture games Shadowgate and  Deja Vu. In the game, players take control of an  unnamed protagonist who stumbles into a  mansion searching for his lost sibling.The title screen for the NES versionThere are several versions of the game, the first of which being adapted to the  Macintosh. As with most MacVenture games, it features no sound, instead guiding the player by narration only. Many ports followed, including a NES version published by Kemco and localized into Japanese (the Japanese title of the game is Akuma no Shoutaijou, or "Demon's Invitation"). The NES version added music and changed many lines of text, altering key plot points along the way. Some notable changes include the sibling swap mentioned below, and the change of the address assigned to the mansion itself. The address was originally Master Crowley, 666 Blackwell Road, Loch Ness,  Scotland, but was shortened to just Master Crowley due to Nintendo's strict policy for family-friendliness.Uninvited had a rather good reception, despite the fact that the game was relatively unknown. Many people compared the game to Deja Vu (a well-received point-and-click adventure game), or claimed that it was better than Deja Vu. Nintendo Power had Uninvited in their section called "Playback," in which they feature classic games which they feel were great and deserve to be replayed.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game starts the player in a car that has been recently crashed--and is about to explode. After regaining his senses and slowly realize that he in danger, the unnamed protagonist manages to escape the exploding car. After recovering from that shock, the hero realizes that his sibling is missing (a younger brother in the original Mac version, or an older sister in the NES port). After looking around, the player will notice an ominous mansion several steps away.The rest of the game is just the player exploring the mansion, and discovering things about the mysterious owner. The mansion is apparently haunted;  ghosts,  skeletons, and  goblins greet the player around every corner. Eventually, it is revealed that the vile Dracan plans on  sacrificing the hero's sister. After rescuing the sibling, the game ends, and all is well again.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]What the gameplay screen looks like in the NES versionThe game is a standard point-and-click adventure game that revolves around a mystery in the same vein that Deja Vu and  Shadowgate do. The player can choose from several different actions to perform on various objects and in various places, which range from things like move, open, and take. The main goal is that the hero's sibling has gone missing, but that will shortly play second fiddle to the player's survival. Throughout the story the player slowly gain access to new areas, and unravel a bit of the mystery shrouding over the mansion.Items gathered in the mansion can then be used via the menu for a variety of effects. Some items kill the player (for example, using an axe on self causes death), while others are needed to proceed in the game. Most of the items are useless--just there as decoration--but can still be taken.One of the first items found in the game is a  spellbook that teaches the player a few spells. Spells can be acquired and then used. Although several are not used throughout the entire game, a few of them are needed to finish the game.The MansionThe infamous Scarlet O'Hara ghost.The mansion is--for the most part--non-linear. The player is free to explore its many rooms and various passageways. The mansion contains many oddities, from a maze filled with zombies to a jail cell that will trap the player for eternity. In addition, the mansion is filled with all kinds of enemies from the infamous Scarlet O'Hara skeleton ghost that can immediately kill the player in the beginning of the game to the aforementioned zombies. The mansion also takes a toll on the player, so spending too much time in it will cause the player to sink into insanity, triggering a game over. At first, the mansion appears to be a regular mansion, but after exploring for a while, it is obvious that that is not the case.After spending time exploring the mansion, the player will find many strange things about not only the owner of the mansion (Dracan), but the nature of the mansion itself. Many of Dracan's servants have quarters scattered throughout the mansion, leaving clues for the player to continue the quest. When the player finally figures out that the evil Dracan plans to sacrifice the player's sister in order to resurrect himself, an underground secret lair of some sorts is discovered, leading the player not only to Dracan's resting place, but eventually to the sister.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Unlike the first two games in the series, which fell into the roleplaying and resource-management category, Universe 3 poses true logic-based puzzles for you to solve. Your characters move about in much the same way as their counterparts in Breach, Omnitrend's tactical combat RPG.[CR]You set out to escort a diplomat on a trip to the hyperspace booster (a key element of Universe 2) to investigate the disappearance of shipments from Earth to this remote corner of the star map. The story takes a quick twist when you and your crew are captured, forcing you to rack up some criminal charges during your escape. You'll spend the rest of your time looking for evidence about the missing shipments, which will clear you of the charges as well as wrap up the mystery.</plot>

Unreal is a magical world where you must save Princess Isolde, your true love, from the evil Polymorphic, the Master of Darkness.[CR]Unreal is made up of 8 levels and contains a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics.  The environment is also completely interactive - you can run up and down hills and slide through the snow but you have to be careful to not fall of the top of a cliff.[CR]On each level you will be faced with puzzles and battles and you need to get the high score you pass to the next level.  If your health reaches zero you will die and the game is over.  Fortunately, your health is replenished at the end of each level.</plot>

			<title_clean>The Untouchables</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Untouchables is a shooter that alternates from on-rails shooting range stages and side-scrolling stages with mild platforming. It loosely follows the events of the 1987 movie. It was released on multiple systems in the late 80s, with more ports appearing into the 1990s.The later 1994 Super Nintendo version is based on the 1993 TV serial rather than the movie. This is evinced by the various still photographs the game uses in its menus: Tom Amandes as Eliot Ness and William Forsythe as Capone, rather than the movie's Costner and De Niro.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Utopia takes the Sim City gameplay concept and adds a military element to it. The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</plot>

The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.</plot>

			<title_clean>Vengeance of Excalibur</title_clean>
			<plot>Vengeance of Excalibur is a follow up to Spirit of Excalibur (developed by Synergistic in 1990).  It is a fantasy action role-playing game.   [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game picks up where the previous game ended. The story kicks off in a newly reunited England, more specifically castle Camelot. Some strangers manage to enter the castle and to turn king Constantine into stone and then steal Excalibur, the Holy Grail and sorceress Nineve. With Camelot's mystical treasures stolen, demons and monster roam the countryside. It is up to the Knights of the Round Table to end this stiuation and restore peace to the land.   The player controls a group of knights bound for Spain, where they hope to find the culprit.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is divided into seven episodes. The gameplay is a mix of RPG, Adventure and some basic strategy. The player can travel to many different towns, cities and castles. When traveling to different locations, you do so from an overhead map. When you enter a location the perspective switches to a 2D perspective with hand-drawn backgrounds.  The player controls a core-group of four knights, although different characters can temporarily join the group. The knights have different strange and weaknesses. The player is given an option to import characters from the previous game in the series, Spirit of Excalibur.   There are three different combat-styles which the player can choose for the knights. These are Reckless (offensive), normal, and cautious (defensive).   The game was originally released for MS-DOS in 1991, then later the Amiga and Atari ST.   [CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Amiga-version received mixed reviews from the press. Info gave the game credit for its non-derivative Arthurian-tale and nice looking graphics, while Amiga Power criticized the excessive disk-swapping and lack of support for the A500 Plus. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Venus the Flytrap is a 1990 side-scrolling shooter-platformer from Core Design and Gremlin Graphics. The player, as the eponymous robot insect, moves across a number of stages earning power-ups and destroying rival cybernetic bugs.Venus can use its wings to make large jumps from platform to platform, and occasionally will pass over a tile that reverses gravity and allows them to walk along the ceiling (like in the NES game Metal Storm). The player can find weapon power-ups, score boosts and, occasionally, instant-death traps by defeating enemies and shooting the pellets they leave behind.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Verminator is a platformer in which the player takes the control of Jake, an exterminator. The basic idea is that he walks and jumps through the game world and kills all vermin he meets. A radar routes him to the infested areas and teleports help to shorten the way. Every week, indicated by a time limit, he receives money for every killed vermin and the game can be saved. Said money can be reinvested in shops to buy useful items like weapons, extra lives or a permission to use the teleports. If money runs out, he can lend it at a bank in return to heavy interests. An alternative way to gain money is gambling in the casino.</plot>

			<plot>The Operation Wolf arcade game was the obvious inspiration for this shoot 'em up. As a lone soldier you must shoot your way through waves of soldiers, tanks and helicopters, armed with only bullets and grenades. You aim at these by controlling a crosshair with the mouse, using the left button to shoot bullets and the right button to fire grenades. You are limited for both of these, but more can be collected as they appear throughout the game by shooting them. Your strength is limited and deteriorates as you get hit - avoid letting it drop to zero.</plot>

			<plot>A multi-level vertically scrolling shoot 'em up along similar lines to SWIV. You fly a plane through inhospitable landscapes full of enemy fighters and gun turrets. Most of the planes come at you in formation, firing easily-visible orange bullets at you, and can be either shot or avoided. The turrets are capable of rotating in 8 directions and aiming at you as best they can, so be careful to dodge their bullets. [CR]There are also larger vehicles which fly down the screen in a direct vertical line. The helicopters hold power-ups including extra weapons (which you only get for a limited number of shots; this is the one time where holding down fire constantly (on an auto fire joystick) isn't hugely beneficial), speed-ups and energy recharge (once your vehicle's damage reaches 100%, you lose that one of your 5 lives). The planes are huge and fire a constant volley at you, but offer a huge 5,000 points if taken down. At the end of each level an even bigger plane comes at you, weaving from left to right while gradually moving down the screen (and eventually out of the bottom of the screen and back through the top).</plot>

			<plot>Viz: The Game is an action game where the players run through various scrolling environments. It is based on a British comic magazine VIZ which, like the game, features lots of crude humour and fart jokes. The player controls one of the 3 Viz characters - Johnny Fartpants, Buster Gonad, or Biffa Bacon. The race takes place in five different scrolling environments; country, town, building site, beach and a disco. During the race you have to dodge traps and other characters from the VIZ comics. There are also two mini-games for each character which include Pint Drinking, blowing up balloons with farts and Pancake Flattening.</plot>

			<title_clean>Volfied</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Volfied is an Arcade title released by  Taito in 1989 as the sequel to QIX II. As well as ports for the PC Engine, Genesis and the home computers Atari ST, Amiga and PC, Volfied was also released on the 2005 PS2 compilation Taito Legends and as a Java mobile game in Europe in 2007.On home consoles in North America, it was marketed under the more familiar QIX brand. It was known as The Jintori ~Volfied 1500 (Japan) and Neo QIX (US) for its PlayStation port, which was part of the Simple budget series. For its North American Sega Genesis release, it was known as Ultimate QIX.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with QIX, the goal is to carve out pieces of the playing field by drawing a box that encapsulates a certain percentage of the screen. While drawing these boxes, the player's vehicle is vulnerable to the various enemy craft patrolling the playing field. Areas within the drawn squares turn inert and are inaccessible by enemies. Once the player turns enough of the playing field inert, which is a minimum of 80% for Volfied (up from the 70% needed for QIX), the level is complete and the player earns a bonus based on how far over the minimum percentage amount they managed to achieve. Each screen has one large enemy that cannot be defeated: if the player cuts the field in half with one maneuver, the "active" playing field will be whichever side holds the large enemy. Smaller enemies, however, will be destroyed if they are inside the inert area.Volfied introduces small bonus pods that, once enveloped in a box, confer bonuses and power-ups to the player. The type of power-up they earn is based on the letter on the power-up.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Volleyball Simulator is, probably not entirely surprising, a game about the sport volleyball. The game features full six-athlete teams and the original rule set with one playing mode: a single match, either against the AI or another player. However, there is room for customization with the tactics menu. Here players can set the defense and offense strategy and the position of every athlete.</plot>

			<plot>Boots Barker does not have a good day. His wife and his best friend cheated on him and during a balloon trip over Africa, they leave him there to die. And he probably will because a medicine man forced him to wear a voodoo mask which prevents him permanently to leave the jungle. To get rid of the thing, he needs to find this medicine man. Voodoo Nightmare is an isometric action game with puzzle elements. The game world consists of a jungle and five temples which have to be cleared. To do so, Boots need to travel inside the temples, collect all diamonds and offer them to the temple god. In return he receives a magic ability for this voodoo doll which allows him to proceed somewhere else in the jungle. Some of those diamonds are hidden and need to be found by killing the correct enemy or by performing actions, e.g. jumping puzzles or sliding blocks correctly. Fruit and additional jewels act as currency and can be reinvested inside the jungle shops which have useful items in stock, e.g. weapons, dynamite or maps. If Boots feels lucky, he can also visit casinos.</plot>

			<plot>WWF Wrestlemania is a wrestling game with arcade elements, which uses the World Wrestling Federation license. The player can control one of the three available wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, the Ultimate Warrior, or the British Bulldog.The player either participates in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr. Perfect) or in a sequence of five matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. The opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, the opponents will deliver a taunt, which the player must respond to as creatively as possible.The game is viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. The player's aim is to pin the opponent to the ground for three seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, the player can waggle the joystick to ensure he wins the grapple.</plot>

Each mission is taking place in different location with little repetitive signs further in the game. Starting point is at the jungle, but you will also visit some kind of stores, sewers and factories. Your task is to get at the end of mission and destroy main boss. Throughout your way a lot of enemies is waiting for you. Expect heavy resistance by infantry armed with machine guns, guided missiles and grenades. Of course, enemies are using plenty of vehicles so prepare for trains, tanks, helicopters, jeeps and even one submarine. Luckily you aren't reliant to machine gun only. Shoot boxes with "W" sign and arm yourself with better/stronger weapons like grenades thrower, flammer, guided missiles launcher or laser. Also watch carefully for hostages. If you release one, you'll be awarded with points or health-pack.</plot>

			<plot>Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in history, was fought on June 18, 1815 between the French Forces of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the English and combined Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under Field Marshall Blucher.[CR]Waterloo the game was a revolutionary new concept in wargaming when it was published in 1989. Waterloo dispensed with the normal overview given to wargame commanders and instead gave a player the same point of view as real commanders on the field of battle.[CR]Your orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. Your orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or your officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.</plot>

To fill the cans, the joystick must be moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your joystick to the right and pressing the joystick button.

			<plot>In Wicked, a big evil has come to the world and the player has to drive it back. To do so, the twelve astrological signs (with three levels each) have to be purged. The basic idea is that portals spit out spores which can be either good or evil. The goal is to produce enough good spores to overrun and destroy all evil portals before the screen is filled with bad spores. The player has to manage the time resources because everything has to be done manually: shooting at the evil spore growth to drive it back and picking up good spores to create good spore portals at strategically useful positions. Additional gameplay elements are Guardians which fly around the screen and are unhealthy when touched, a night-time-rhythm which influence the spore growth and tarot cards which get revealed in regular intervals. These have either good or bad influences for the one who picks it up. There are three options to set the gameplay: action-oriented, strategy-oriented or mixed.</plot>

			<plot>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone.Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside.Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons.They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy.The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government.The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks.One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions.The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success.The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars.This raid was an important stage in the whole operation.Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories.On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime.This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to bring him back safely.You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last seen.You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders.They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights.Once you reach the point where "The Boss" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place.On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect "The Boss" whose physical condition has been worn out.Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you.</plot>

			<plot>The sequel to Moebius, Windwalker combines role-playing with side-view beat 'em up gameplay. You are accompanied by Moebius on a quest to master the martial arts.Hostile persons including thieves, guards and assassins will be encountered; you fight them in real time using moves such as cartwheels and flying kicks. This can be played either as a continuous battle, or with short breaks to catch your composure.The role-playing elements eschew the Ultima-style plan view in favor of a pseudo-3D system. Deism and Shamanism are just some of the included magic disciplines. Magical vehicles help you get around the 100 landscapes more quickly, although you spend much time on foot. The game takes place in a fully active universe of characters such as villagers and giant beetles, all getting about their business within a day/night cycle and variable weather.</plot>

			<title_clean>Wings of Death</title_clean>
			<plot>Wings of Death is a vertically scrolling shoot'em'up with a fantasy setting. You start out as a small insect, flying through a deranged castle filled with hostile animals and monsters.[CR]The upgrade system is rich, and differs somewhat from genre conventions. As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull. These will downgrade your weapon or draw your energy level.[CR]After fighting the end boss of the castle, a three-headed dragon, you move onto a jungle, a swamp and further... That is, if you survive. Wings of Death has an unparalleled number of bullets and enemy objects on-screen for its time and platform, the maximum number being reported as 95. Coded by former demo programmers, the game also runs in full 50 or 60 Hz scrolling while playing digitised music even on an Atari ST, thanks to inventive hardware tricks used in few other commercial games. It also utilises the extra colour palettes of the Atari STe.</plot>

			<plot>Winter Supersports 92 is a sports game with eight events from the Winter Olympiad. The basic goal is to participate in all events in a row (events can be deselected, though) and the player with the most points is the winner. If multiple players participate, two of them are playing at the same time on a split-screen. Then the next batch of two starts.Downhill Skiing, Giant Slalom, Pro Ski Challenge are downhill courses in which the player has to circuit obstacles.The Bale Jumping and Speed Skating events require the player to alternate pressing left and right while keeping a rhythm.Bobsled and Luge are also similar to each other: the athletes are shown from behind and the player has to steer the bob/luge. The bob additionally has a brake.Skidoo Racing consists of a top-down course which needs to be completed as fast as possible. Only a part of the course is shown at a time; the screen scrolls.</plot>

			<plot>Wipe-Out is a light cycle game with hover boards. The gameplay itself is simple: two players (the second either AI or human) race in a closed off area and both leave behind an energy trail. However crashes into the walls or an energy trail loses the match. Random appearing power ups give advantages if picked up, e.g. going through the opponent's trail. The camera is placed behind the shoulder and the screen is always split.This is all embedded in leagues on different planets. The ultimate goal is to get better and better until the player is invited to an ultimate championship with a great prize. Between matches, the player can upgrade the hoverboard, e.g. adding brakes or a better engine, or bet on the outcome of AI matches. All planets have a difficulty rating which influences the rewarded fame and money for winning.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizworld is the brightly coloured home of Wiz and his fantastic cat Catelite. All is not well however as an evil force intends to stamp out the brilliant spectrum of colour once and for all. Conquer the aliens, stir the spell and colour the planet![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizball follows many of the basic tenets of a side-scrolling shoot-em-up: enemies frequently appear and by destroying them the player can acquire power-up orbs that provide them with additional abilities, such as a multi-directional shot, a limited shield and an " option" in the form of the wizard's cat called the Catellite.Wizball initially begins as a difficult-to-control bouncing ball, with the player carefully adjusting its rise and fall to collect the first few power-ups, which first stabilizes the bouncing and then allows flight. Further power-ups unlock the various weapons and, importantly, the Catellite.The actual goal of the game is to use the Catellite to absorb colored droplets from specific enemy waves. These droplets, collected in the three primary colors of red, blue and yellow, are then used to transform the current stage from monochromatic to brightly colored. Each stage requires three "coats", which color-in various levels of shading in the background. After successfully shading in one stage, the player is taken to a bonus stage where the goal is to survive as long as possible against endless numbers of enemies. Afterwards, the wizard brews the potion to color in the world (while the cat enjoys a saucer of milk as a reprieve) and the player is sent back into the world as Wizball with all existing power-ups intact. The player is able to move from stage to stage using warp pipes, which are scattered throughout every level.The droplets, while normally found in the usual three colors, can occasionally fall in different colors instead. Like in games such as Arkanoid, these bonuses are specific to their colors, appear randomly and have both positive and negative consequences:Cyan - Collecting a cyan droplet calls in "the fuzz", a group of fast, erratic-moving enemies with sirens. They are the most dangerous enemies in the game.Pink/Purple - Causes the Catellite to go completely haywire, preventing it from being used effectively.Black - Causes a black-out, making it hard to see the stage and its obstacles.Grey - Turns Catellite invincible, making collections easier.White - Gives the player an extra life.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Wizkid - The Story of Wizball II</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizkid: The Story of Wizball II is an action/adventure game developed by Sensible Software and published by Ocean Software for the PC, Amiga, and Atari ST platforms. It splits its time between an Arcade mode which plays similarly to Breakout but with full control of the "ball", and an Adventure mode which relies on adventure game inventory puzzles.Wizkid, the son of Wiz from Wizball, is tasked with saving the nine kittens of Wiz's cat Nifla. He must pass through a series of abstract levels defeating enemies and finding the kittens before he can confront their kidnapper Zark.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizkid is split into two modes: Arcade and Adventure.ArcadeIn this mode, also known as "Head mode", Wizkid must use the floating blocks around him to take out enemies. This is possible by ramming Wizkid (currently just a disembodied head, like his predecessor in Wizball) into the blocks to dislodge them, using the direction and speed with which Wizkid hits the blocks to send them falling onto the enemies below. Doing so will reward Wizkid with colorful musical notes which will eventually fill a little music sheet at the top of the screen and allows him to enter the other mode: Adventure. If the player beats a stage without leaving Arcade mode, which eventually cycles around, they'll almost always end up skipping a stage and missing the true ending. If Wizkid fails to beat a screen by dropping all the blocks while there's still enemies left on the screen it'll get skipped and the player will eventually cycle back to it.In Arcade mode Wizkid can collect two power-ups: a clown's red nose, used to balance blocks until Wizkid's ready to send them at enemies; and a pair of false teeth, used to grip a block so Wizkid can directly maneuver it over an enemy.AdventureIn Adventure mode, Wizkid reclaims his full body and is able to explore the level proper, finding secrets, using the store and collecting items to use elsewhere. Solutions to finding the kittens (the true goal) are often obtuse and sometimes requires a guide. If the player gets stuck in this mode, they can always return to Arcade and continue the game from there by holding down on the joystick and summoning the store interface.Finding all nine kittens from the nine worlds allows Wizkid to race Zark back to his tower in a rowboat and defeat him face-to-face - any fewer kittens and he'll beat Wizkid in the race and lock the front door. To beat Zark the player has to get the high score on his "Wizeroids" arcade machine (a parody of Asteroids).[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Wolfchild</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfchild is a 2D shooter/platformer from British developers Core Design, which would later go on to create the Tomb Raider franchise. It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In this WW2 combat simulation one or two players can take command of one of three different sets of naval vessels. German U-boats, U.S. destroyers or Allied merchant ships are there, waiting for the right commands. They operate in small groups, just as the real things did in WW2. Full status screens tell you what state your boat is in at any time. It's possible to play one of the twelve built-in scenarios or an self-created scenario. The game has no career mode.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wonder Boy in Monster Land is the second of the Wonder Boy series and marks the series' first foray as an action RPG, rather than a simple platformer. Future Wonder Boy games (the series would eventually be rebranded Monster World) would retain the RPG elements, while the platforming aspect would continue in the Wonder Boy "spin-off" series Adventure Island.The goal of the game is to move Wonder Boy across the world, fighting monsters and collecting money and using that money to purchase upgrades to armor and weapons. Wonder Boy must face a significant number of bosses as well, each with varying attack patterns. Though careful platforming is a necessity, exploration and backtracking are also occasionally required if the player wishes to reach the end of the game.The game was released in the Arcades initially by Sega in 1987, eventually moving to their Sega Master System the following year. It was also published by Activision for many Western home computers like the Amiga, C64 and ZX Spectrum a year after that in 1989. Since then it has been rereleased several more times, first as a 2005 mobile game, then a 2008/9 Virtual Console port for the Wii (using the Sega Master System version) and most recently in 2012 as part of a compilation of Monster World games available for PSN, XBLA and Virtual Console.Additionally, the game received at least three major graphical overhauls which were released under different names. The first was a PC Engine port the same year as its Arcade release, renamed Bikkuriman World and published by Hudson Soft. Jaleco ported the game with Journey to the West graphics as Saiyuki World for the NES. Finally, the Brazilian version of the Sega Master System changed the graphics to resemble a Brazilian comic named Monica's Gang. Excepting the graphical switch, each version is functionally identical to the original.[CR]Turbografx-16/PC-Engine Version[CR]Wonder Boy in Monster Land was ported to the PC Engine system as one of its two launch titles, though it received a new title - Bikkuriman World - and an entirely new set of sprites to become part of the Bikkuriman license.Bikkuriman was originally a series of collectible stickers that were included with a sweet confection, sort of like the Japanese equivalent of the US's Bazooka Joe. Its popularity among children eventually led to manga and anime adaptations; the first anime adaptation coinciding with the release of the game.[CR]Brazilian Version[CR]The Sega Master System release in Brazil, a nation where the SMS retained its popularity for many years after it had been supplanted elsewhere by the Sega Genesis, also received a visual makeover in a similar fashion to the Bikkuriman World port. In this case, the game's name was changed to M&#244;nica no Castelo do Drag&#227;o and retooled to resemble a Brazilian comic named Monica's Gang.[CR]SEGA AGES[CR]As part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game will hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd in Japan. For the PlayStation 3, the title is released for &#165;600. For the Xbox 360, the title is released in a bundle with Wonder Boy V: Monster World III and Monster World IV for 800 MS Points.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Manage a stable of 3 wannabe heavyweight world champions in this unusual twist of the standard football management style. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing your office.[CR]Training your fighters involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. [CR]There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but one who can get your fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, negotiating the best financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.[CR]Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules, and a fight in one set of rules wont be viewed quite as significantly by the other.[CR]The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges decision would go). Before and during the fights you can instruct your man as to what tactics to adopt.</plot>

It is based on the 1990 World Cup event, which for that year was set in Italy, and features 24 international sides competing for the titular trophy. The game features a top-down, vertically-oriented perspective of the pitch.Because the game was created several months before the 1990 World Cup, even before the qualifying rounds had concluded, the twenty-four teams the game features would not correlate to the actual twenty-four that competed in the event.TeamsIncluded below is an alphabetical list of all the teams that competed in the 1990 World Cup as well as the teams that are featured in this game.

			<plot>Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.[CR]Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks  or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacons long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.[CR]Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the Wreckers) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the stations corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.[CR]In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the stations droid factory.[CR]Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. [CR]Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the alien invasion action archetype.</plot>

			<plot>In principle, this is yet another (technically very impressive) horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. The interesting twist about the scenario is that it doesn't play in space like the similar game R-Type and most of its clones - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater.[CR]Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.</plot>

			<plot>You have landed your crippled ship at the Atargis mining station. The platform was deserted and no one answered your radio calls. Now you are forced to enter the station and find a way to get off the asteroid. Hopefully whatever happened to the 200 personnel in the labyrinth of mines under the station won't happen to you too.[CR]Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like the Dungeon Master series everything happens in real time. You move around in 10 foot steps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items with, a belt and holster for quick access to weapons as well as an inventory for carrying things.[CR]The objective of the game is to find parts to repair your ship. You must also find food and water for sustenance and guns, grenades and mines for self defense. Other items can help you during your mission such as environmental suits, security passes and a motion detector. Data disks found throughout the station will fill in the story.</plot>

			<title_clean>Xenon</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Xenon is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up loosely inspired by Xevious in which the player, as the futuristic pilot Darrian, must make their way through four sectors to save humanity from the Xenite alien race. The game was the first to be developed by The Bitmap Brothers, who would become renowned for their presentations. It was developed for the Atari ST in 1988 and soon ported to various other home computers.Xenon was followed by a sequel: Xenon 2: Megablast. Megablast dropped the shapeshifting aspect to the player's craft but expanded the number of power-ups on offer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Xenon is to simply reach the top of the "sector" and defeat two bosses along the way: one midway through the sector and one right at the end. While not available in every sector, the player could transform their craft into a tank that was capable of moving and shooting in eight directions. The standard jet plane variant could only point and fire upwards. Both forms were often necessary to avoid enemies and collect power-ups: taking damage from shots was considerably less dangerous than colliding into enemies or walls.The boss of each stage is the Sentinel, a face-like robot that needs to be destroyed by removing its front-facing shielding and firing at its core. Each time the Sentinel is met, it adopts a movement pattern that is harder to elude/predict.Power-UpsThe game uses a letter-based power-up system also seen in Arkanoid or Contra, where each letter represents what the power-up provides.A - Armor. Provides a glowing shield that makes Darrian invulnerable to harm, but expires after fifteen seconds.F - Fuel. Taking damage drops the shields, which in turn drains fuel. By restoring fuel Darrian can increase his shield power and take more shots. Essentially acts as a health restore, and has two strength levels: small health boost and full health boost.H - Homing Missile. Allows Darrian to fire eight shots that spread out in every direction from the craft. Shots will home in on enemies after being fired. Will only last for fifteen seconds, like the armor.L - Laser. Replaces the main weapon with a powerful laser. It doesn't fire quite as quickly, however.G - Gun. Restores the craft's weapon with the standard gun if the player replaced it with the laser.P - Power. Boosts the distance Darrian's bullets travel.R - Rate. Increases the craft's speed in both forms.S - Side. Allows the craft to fire lasers horizontally on either side.W - Wings. Adds options on either side of the Darrian's craft, effectively tripling their firepower.Z - Zap. Acts as an instant smart bomb, eliminating all enemies on the screen.Options - Spherical objects that closely follow behind the craft and fire when it does. The player can collect up to three.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.[CR]The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.[CR]A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.</plot>

			<title_clean>Xenophobe</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Arcade version with the middle player station activated.Xenophobe in the arcades had a very unique look. There were 3 flight joystick type controls, which is a very odd choice for a side scrolling action game with humanoid characters. The game allowed for 3 player coop, and the screen would be split 3 times, which worked well for the corridor nature of the gameplay. Many of the alien designs were modeled heavily off of Aliens / H.R. Giger's artwork, although with a cartoony bent to things, with very expressive faces on the larger versions of the aliens. There was a loving, satirical bent to a lot of the background choices and features, including having a Star-Trek style beaming down sequence, as well as some of the player characters resembling figures from popular culture.Some of the home versions of the game, such as the Lynx version, allowed for extra gameplay features and items. Unfortunately, most of the special items were originally supposed to be included with all versions, but these were scaled back before the arcade version was released.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Character selection varied depending upon which version you were playing, although you often got to select from different crew-members. They only varied in looks, but each had a different, expressive head and corresponding animations, and in the arcade version they were in teams of three with differently colored uniforms.Once each player selected their character, you approach the first base and beam down. Your character begins with a weapon resembling a phaser, which fires small, short-range energy pulses. Should you get knocked down, you will lose grip on your weapon and it will be sent flying. If this happens too often, the weapon will explode, leaving you with only your fists to defend yourself. There is, however, a little droid that will roam around and dispense phasers, usually if a player is unarmed for a considerable length of time.Players navigate the base by moving right or left, and they may jump or crouch. Ducking decreases speed but also decreases your profile, so it's often recommended unless you're in a hurry. There are also items on the ground, some of which are picked up by pressing a button. These may restore your health, solve a puzzle, or will just give you points (although originally all items were planned with one use in mind). You may also interact with glowing buttons in the background, which can halt a base's self destruct sequence (or start it), change displays, activate elevators, or other actions.All three players are active. Mr. Eeez is on the ground, looking sheepish.Should a player be knocked down, they can still shoot in one direction until they pick themselves up off the ground. In a desperate situation it's safer to keep firing rather than right yourself, because when lying down you're already as low as you can go. Getting up again may mean you get knocked down, increasing the chance your weapon will be destroyed and preventing you from doing as much damage as you could in the same length of time.In multiplayer games you work cooperatively, although you can still be a bastard and take all the items. There are also grenades which can do a significant amount of damage to enemies, or to friends. Fists, too, damage fellow player characters. Players can stay in the same room and help each other fend of aliens, or they can split up (always a good idea, huh?).Play continues until all aliens are eliminated from the base or ship, the base self destructs, players activate the evacuation sequence, or all player characters are killed. Should everyone survive, bonuses are totaled up and the intrepid crew heads to the next infestation site to beam down again. It's worth noting that the thing characters beam down from is a disc that the player ship sends to each of the bases. You're seen beaming down from that disc, rather than the ship itself, which is slightly more plausible than the Star Trek version of beaming![CR]Enemies and Obstacles[CR]Mr. M. Brace taking a stroll on the surface of an infested planet.The enemies in the game are aliens reminiscent of Giger's Alien, but only somewhat. It grows rapidly in stages, eventually reaching a point where they're a serious threat to your health. Aliens also have tentacle arms which reach through the floor and ceiling; if they grab you they slowly damage you, though they can be blasted away with a few hits. There are also several obstacles in the game, including a malfunctioning grenade dispenser that fires off grenades at random, an electrified field, and acidic slime dripping from the ceiling. There are also amoebae and out-of-control defense drones that don't know friend from foe.The aliens in the game contribute to a percentage of infestation. If this percentage is reduced to zero, you clear the stage immediately and are extracted from the base. This gives you a significant bonus of points, much more than if the self-destruct timer destroys the base.Alien stages are as follows:Pod (early stage): The first two stages are when the creatures are at their weakest. A few hits should kill them.Pod (late stage): Little difference between the two beginning egg stages and this, except if it changes again you will be facing a creature that can actually do damageCritter: Resembling a cornucopia with legs sticking out, this little bugger crawls along the ground and attaches to an explorer if it gets close enough. You must throw it off as soon as possible, because it nibbles on you until it's thrown loose, causing damage over time.Rollerbaby: The next stage is one of the most troublesome. In its open form it merely crawls along the ground and does damage to the player character, but if it rolls up into a ball it is all but indestructible, going so far as to deflect weapons fire. Blasting it will also make it bounce around the room, causing characters damage if it makes contact with them.Snotterpillar (full-grown): This the deadliest of the normal aliens. It has a lot of hit points, and takes quick leaps in the rooms, bowling characters over and causing significant damage. It also flings acidic spit at you from a distance. These guys can be blasted apart in mid air as they're about to hit you, which is super awesome.In addition to the main aliens, there are especially deadly aliens with psychic powers (called Festor) that appear by peeking around doorways and from behind scenery in the darker sections. If your character is standing and facing them too closely, they will be caught in an electric brain beam, causing a lot of damage and throwing them far once they're released. This creature also throws pre-pod eggs that cause damage as well, and in some versions these can become new pods.It's worth noting that the aliens themselves are generated randomly throughout the level. Killing end-stage aliens does not mean you're less likely to see more end-stagers later, and killing eggs doesn't decrease the overall alien count. So you can shift from room to room to try to get a more favorable situation, but it's often risky to do so.[CR]Weaponry[CR]In addition to your normal blaster, you can find grenades that are thrown in a short arc and do a lot of damage to enemies and allies nearby. These are very dangerous and take some getting used to.In addition there are several firearms which have strengths and weaknesses:A laser-like beam weapon that shoots at extreme distance rapidly, but doesn't do much more damage than the basic weapon.A lightning gun that fires at a moderate distance but does a lot of damageAn extermination gas gun that shoots a very short distance but does extreme damage[CR]Resolution[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] continues until all players are eliminated, assuming continues are not an option. In the Lynx version you were allowed to go through the roster of main characters before the game was over.Player with the highest score has bragging rights![CR]Lynx Version[CR]The Atari Lynx allowed for multiple players by linking several systems together. In addition, one player could actually play one of the aliens and grief the other players by jumping at them, spitting at them (meaning in the game), and stealing items off the ground.Items were more functional than in other versions, and one item worth noting was the jet pack (which could be just as harmful as helpful to the user!). It also has an end boss (!) called the Mother Festor.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game or an unusually complex coin-op shoot 'em up, depending on your point of view. With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.[CR]The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.</plot>

After clearing Jellystone Park of litter, he must go underwater to fix its water supply. He must then explore a swamp to fix Ranger Smith's bike, find misplaced objects in a film studio, and finally reassemble the bed within his cave.[CR]This takes place over platform-style levels, with lots of enemies to be avoided or shot, plus moving platforms and falls. He is armed with a bubble weapon, which is not required on the final level. Collecting pic-a-nic baskets will recharge Yogi's energy.</plot>

			<plot>Like its predecessor X-Out, Z-Out is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. A horde of largely-organic enemies threaten the safety of your planet, and they must be destroyed over the course of six levels.There are power-ups available, but the game is less centered around these than some are. [CR]Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.</plot>

On the main menu there are four icons as well as some major information such as your name, the name of your club, your current league position, a rating and the account balance. The first icon from left is the picture of a computer and by clicking on it you will get to the main database menu where you can handle the players training, studying the coming fixtures and edit the teams or players. The second icon is a telephone. Press it and you will be able to make a phone call to either the Transfer Market (for buying and selling players) or the the Bank (to get a loan). The third icon is a note book and by clicking on it you will see tables from all four divisions. The last icon is the picture of a football pitch and by pressing it you will get to your next match. After choosing your squad you will see the highlights of the match from a top-down perspective. After match you will get reports about players being injured, results in the other matches and the finances for that week.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Possibly an influence for Grand Theft Auto APB (All Points Bulletin) is an      open world driving arcade game developed by Atari in 1987. In arcades it had a very eye catching attract mode. There were actual working red and blue lights spinning on top of the machine. The game is thought to be a primary influence for the     Grand Theft Auto series because APB's open world and overhead,    top-down view of gameplay.      Gameplay Interrogate the wrong doers APB's gameplay focuses on the day in a life of a police officer named Officer Bob. You will drive a   police car from and overhead perspective in an open world, and as Bob you are tasked with ticketing and arresting people committing crimes. You may play one level ticketing litterbugs, and the next level you need to arrest the head litterbug. Other criminals may be dopers or people disturbing the peace. In order to complete levels you need to meet quotas for ticketing and arresting without running out of time or gas. Throughout the levels you can earn more time by collecting donuts, and fill up on gas at different gas pumps. Game Over  There is also a humorous interrogation mini game to earn a higher score. The mini game has you strangling and interrogating those arrested by rapidly pressing a button, and failure simply means don't earn a bonus score. After completing levels successfully you are congradulated by the chief, but failure means you lose your job.            [CR]Other Release [CR] I thought it was an Atari Classic APB was primarily an           arcade game, but has seen many releases on home computers and consoles. Around the time the game was originally released, it was ported to the          PC,         Commodore 64, among other home computers. The different releases retained all the elements of the arcade game. More recently APB has appeared on home consoles in        Midway Arcade Treasures, despite being developed by       Atari.  APB should not be confused with  APB, the MMO of the same name.   [CR]</plot>

It was developed and published by Ocean on almost every system available in the early 90s.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is a traditional platformer. Familiar mechanics such as precisely timed jumping, avoiding spikes, pouncing atop the heads of enemies are all featured.Gomez in The Addams Family.The Addams Family game follows Gomez Addams, as he searches the Addams' residence (which has been taken over by Gomez's evil lawyer, Tully Alford), for his missing family members. There are several stages in the game accessible through different doors in the main hall each housing an imprisoned member of Gomez's family. To free his family, Gomez must traverse each stage and defeat a boss. There are also hidden doors that can lead to rooms with bonus pickups, or even some that can serve as short cuts. Pickups include: hearts which increase health; a sword that is lost after taking damage; a rapid firing marble like item, a power-up that is also lost after taking damage; and yellow dollar signs, one hundred of which will award the player with an extra life.Once Gomez frees Uncle Fester, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Grandmama, he can then enter the final area of the game to save his wife, Morticia.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]After Burner, is an arcade flight sim/shooter, developed by SEGA and first released in 1987 in Japanese Arcades. It was designed by legendary Sega game developer Yu Suzuki. It was ported onto many systems, including Sega's own Sega Master System just a few months after the Arcade launch, but most of them weren't able to match the original Arcade version's visceral speed and graphical/sound quality.It is the first game among a series of franchise sequels such as After Burner II, After Burner III and the 2006 release of After Burner Climax which ran on the then newly developed SEGA Lindbergh arcade hardware. After Burner II was re-released in 2004 for the Playstation 2, in the SEGA AGES 2500 series of budget anniversary re-releases.After Burner Arcade MachineIn After Burner the player controls a F-14 Tomcat, a type of jet, and the object of the game is simply to shoot down other enemy jets while evading their return fire with deft maneuvers. The player-controlled Tomcat is equipped with a machine gun and a small number of missiles as a secondary weapon which replenishes after each completed stage.The original After Burner machine is a rarity, exclusively available in the Japanese Arcades. It was controlled with a simulating flight stick, with buttons that controlled the cannon and missile weapons. Movement such as dropping/gaining altitude and barrelrolling was also perfomed by movements with the flight stick.The arcade version also featured a deluxe cabinet, which rotated according to the player's movements (much like Space Harrier and Galaxy Force). This was featured in the arcade scene of the 1991 hit movie Terminator 2: Judgement Day, where it was being played by a teenage John Connor. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>You have been turned into a ball of air with a slow leak by an evil wizard. You must find the Spellbook and the ingredients for the spell. Without these, you will never turn back into a human again.[CR]These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Aliens are invading Earth and only the only thing that stands in their way are the 'Alien Busters'. Karen, Gordon, and Scooter must take to the streets and send the aliens back to the mothership. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Alien Storm is a side-scrolling brawler for up to three players in the Arcade version, two players in the Genesis version, and one in the Master System version. Players take control of one of the three members of the 'Alien Busters' over six stages, each containing multiple levels and boss battles.Players fight multiple types of aliens in the game, each move and attack differently, some using the environment to attack or hide from danger. Killing some aliens will drop power-ups, giving the player either extra lives, energy or health.Each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, e.g. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon and a special attacks which differ greatly depending on the game's version. Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. A large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low. At the end of each mission is a bonus stage, where the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, or an auto-scrolling running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but features ranged weapons. [CR]Platform Variation[CR]Special attacks (mentioned above)Number of simultaneous players (mentioned above)Karen is absent in the Master System version of the game.Gordon is named Garth in some versionsScooter the robot, is named "Slammer" in Master System version.The Genesis and Mega Drive version has 8 stages instead of 6.In the console and Japanese arcade versions, Gordon has red clothes while Karen has a yellow outfit. In the US arcade version, Gordon is dressed in blue and Karen is in red. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>You, Kai are about to marry your sweetheart Medb, but Slough Feg and his minions have kidnapped her and taken her to the far side of The Cave of Dreams. Swearing a bit too loud about rescuing her, Slough Feg has heard you and turned you into an insect. With the help of magic from the Druid Lords though, you set off on your quest.To help you, some minions leave behind either a power-up for your weapon or Zen, the currency of The Cave of Dreams. Zen can be spent in the shops that litter the landscape. Here you can buy health or extra weapons. Kai has three lives which are lost when his two energy dots turn from white, cycle through various colours before turning black.Alien World is a scrolling shoot-em-up. Various levels scroll horizontally while others scroll vertically. The screen will only scroll when you move so far across the screen. You cannot re-trace your steps. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, amount of Zen, Energy dots, lives and various weapons. The joystick moves Kai, but not touching the joystick lets gravity kick in. The fire button fires your weapon.</plot>

			<title_clean>Altered Beast</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Altered Beast is a side-scrolling, 2D beat 'em up. At the beginning of the first level, Zeus fires lightning into the ground, commanding a centurion to "Rise from your grave!" The centurion begins each level with a few attacks. He can perform a standard punch, a ducking punch, a jumping punch, a shin kick, a vertical kick, or a jumping kick. If he kills a white wolf enemy and grabs the flying orbs they leave behind, Zeus yells " Power Up!" and the centurion grows much more muscular, with more powerful punches and kicks. After collecting three orbs, he transforms into one of the following creatures:Level 1 - Wolf: The wolf's punches shoot out fireballs and his kick attack is replaced with a horizontal dash that quickly moves across the screen, killing any enemy in its path.Level 2 - Dragon: The dragon can fly across the screen. His punch is replaced with a lightning bolt that shoots out of the dragon's mouth. His kick is replaced with a radial lightning storm that kills any nearby enemies.Level 3 - Bear: The bear's punch attack is a short-ranged breath attack that turns enemies into stone, which can then be smashed. For his kick attack, the bear becomes an invincible spinning ball that flies straight up, or can be moved in an arc.Level 4 - Tiger: The tiger shoots a fireball from his fists when punching, just like the wolf. His kick is an up-and-down invincible dash.Level 5 - Golden Wolf: The golden wolf has the same moves as the wolf.Each level scrolls automatically to the right, with enemies advancing on the centurion throughout the level. The centurion can take several hits before he is killed. At the end of each level, the centurion faces off with the evil boss Neff, who transforms into a hideous monster capable of withstanding many attacks. Once Neff is destroyed for good, after the fifth level, the Altered Beast rescues the goddess Athena, and the game begins again from the first level.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>As a Defender clone, Anarchy is a sidescrolling parallax shooter, in which you take on the evil Anarchists and their destructive behaviour. Your ship moves left or right on a looping level, shooting the enemies and finally the bosses. You have a single life with gradually draining energy. No less than 50 High Scores are recorded.[CR]There are no surprises in gameplay, except the usual upgrades for your ship - X-shaped pods reveal circles, which can be collected to produce multiple fire beams, multi-directional shots, and drones with advanced cannons[CR]The action is fast and smooth, and anybody looking for a straight shooter might take a glimpse, although the reviews from the magazines mostly ranged from bad to mid-class.[CR]Anarchy was released under Psygnosis label Psyclapse. The manual comes in four languages: English, French, German and Italian.</plot>

			<plot>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.[CR]An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.[CR]Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</plot>

			<title_clean>Archipel</title_clean>
			<plot>Archipelagos is a real-time puzzle and strategy game with an unconventional premise and equally unconventional gameplay.In the future, man carelessly poisons the earth with nuclear waste. The polar ice caps have melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile. It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island.  Controlling a hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable. To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island, which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it.Obstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power source unless it is connected by a "land bridge" to the generator. You have the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground; necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it; eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you.The entire game plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint. A movable cursor selects where to move or what to manipulate.There are 10,000 islands on Earth to purify. If you can make it past Archipelago #100, you are then free to select any of them.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]The first of  Dynamix's tank-based combat games (followed by     Stellar 7  and     Nova 9 ),  Arcticfox challenges the player to navigate snow fields, crevices, weather, and mud flats while battling an alien force in Antarctica. Reminiscent of     Battlezone , Arcticfox is played entirely through a first-person view, with only a tiny on-screen map to keep the player oriented. The goal of the game is to destroy the aliens' Main Fort, with a variety of sub-objectives that can make the final battle easier. [CR]Weapons and Tactics [CR]The Arcticfox tank is equipped with cannons, guided missiles, and mines (harmful to both the enemy and Arcticfox itself), as well as the unique ability to "dig into" the tundra of the battlefield. While dug in, the player sees only white through the viewport, making situational awareness key. Missiles can still be fired whilst dug in, allowing for surprise attacks.  While the final goal of the game is the destruction / disablement of the Main Fort, there are several other structures that Arcticfox can target. Blowing up the Communications Fort will render enemy scouts unable to report its position, while elimination of the Oxygen Converters slows down the aliens' removal of oxygen from our atmosphere, allowing for more time to complete the mission.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Arena</title_clean>
			<plot>Arena is a sports game published very early in the lifetime of the 16-bit computers Atari ST and Amiga.It features six disciplines, including Long Jump, High Jump, Javelin, Shot Put, Pole Vault and the Hundred Meter run. Up to four players can compete in the events, but not playing at the same time, but in a hot-seat mode. Control is like in other sports games: you have to gain speed pushing the joystick in a perfect rhythm, and pushing the trigger at the right time, i.e. to start jumping in the Long Jump and High Jump discipline.Unlike other games of the genre, humor is not getting short, as a referee is constantly pestering at you, making sarcastic comments if you fail to reach very good results.Most events are visually presented on several screens which are flipped (not scrolled).</plot>

			<plot>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.[CR]The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.[CR]By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</plot>

			<plot>This slow-paced methodical shoot 'em up is viewed from top down, with your ship flying up the screen. The game's levels have a clearly square design to them, with lots of barriers to negotiate as well as aliens (which generally stay in the same vertical plane as they fly towards you).[CR]Many squares featuring a variety of power-up type effects, such as improved weaponry, extra lives, a level warp, a device to stop the landscape's (otherwise constant) scrolling (thereby giving you a chance to 'pick off' the aliens more carefully), and one which speeds up the aliens (avoid this!). You can move backwards a short way, but it takes a few squares' worth of screen to get fully across the screen, so bear this in mind in the mazier sections.</plot>

			<plot>[CR]Character Creation[CR]RacesChoosing a RaceHuman - Average in all regards -- jack of all trades, but master of none. Humans can be any class.Elf - Taller and more frail than humans, but blessed with ability in magic. Elves cannot be hunters.Dwarf - Short and stout, strong and healthy, but not very bright. Dwarves cannot be hunters, conjurers or magicians.Hobbit - Short and nimble, with dextrous fingers. Hobbits cannot be hunters or paladins.Half-Elf - Tall and thin like their elf ancestors, but with the strength of a human. Half-elves cannot be hunters or paladins.Half-Orc - Ugly and foul tempered, they gain the strength and build of their orc cousins. Half-orcs cannot be paladins, bards, hunters or monks.Gnome - Short like a dwarf, but not as stout, and with some amount of magical ability. Gnomes cannot be paladins or bards.ClassesChoosing a ClassWarrior - Specializing in melee combat, warriors can use nearly all weapons and armor. Warriors receive an additional melee attack for every four levels of experience.Paladin - Warriors who have taken an oath to fight evil, and have thus received a greater resistance to magic.Rogue - While only mediocre in combat, rogues specialize in locating and disarming traps. They also have the ability to hide in shadows to avoid a fight.Bard - A returned warrior turned wandering minstrel. He retains many of his combat skills, but prefers song and tales over fighting. With instrument in hand, a bard can play tunes that aid the party or hamper foes.Hunter - More assassin than warrior, the hunter can use most weapons and has a chance of scoring a critical hit on an opponent that causes instant death.Monk - Trained without the need of weapons or armor, his damage and protection come from his knowledge of martial arts rather than his equipment. While monks can use equipment, they will be much more effective without as they gain levels.The HunterConjurer - A spellcaster that specializes in the conjuring the physical, including fire, light and health.Magician - A spellcaster that specializes in altering the physical world, including weapons, armor, and enemies.Sorcerer - A spellcaster that specializes in creating and manipulating illusions, including those that will fight with the player's party. Due to its power, this class is not available to beginning characters, but must be achieved through experience. Only Conjurers and Magicians with three or more spell levels can become Sorcerers.Wizard - A spellcaster that specializes in summoning and binding the supernatural, including those that will fight with the player's party. Due to its power, this class is not available to beginning characters, but must be achieved through experience. Only Sorcerers with three or more spell levels can become Wizards.AttributesCharacter ScreenStrength (ST) - Physical power and forcefulness. Determines how much damage done in melee.

Determines trap avoidance, spell resistance, treasure discovery, and many other hidden abilities.StatisticsInventory ScreenHit Points (HIT) - Maximum amount of health a character has available for his level.Condition (CND) - Current amount of health of a character. Each successful attack by an enemy will lower this number. Once it reaches zero, the character is dead. A character's condition does not replenish naturally, so must be healed by spell or by visiting a temple.Spell Points (SP PT) - Current amount of mental power a character has available for casting spells. Each spell cast lowers this number. Spell points will recharge over time, and the player can visit Roscoe to replenish more quickly.Experience Points - A measure of the character's accomplishments and knowledge. Each enemy slain increases a character's experience, and once enough is accumulated the player attains a new level and new skills.Gold - The life blood of commerce. Gold is found on slain enemies and can be used to buy new gear, heal wounds, and replenish spell points.Level (LV) - Measure of a character's achievement, based on ranges of experience points. A character's level determines his hit points, number of attacks and available spells. Levels are granted at the Review Board.Spell Levels - The highest level of spells a character can use in a magical discipline. Spell levels are determined by experience points and granted by the Review Board, but must be purchased for top price.[CR]Locations[CR]All is not well in the city of Skara Brae. The servants of Mangar The Dark roam the streets and infest its buildings, terrorizing its citizens and bringing the once thriving city to its knees. The player's band of stalwart adventurers must seek to rid the city of this blight, by exploring all manner of dungeons, castles and towers, and defeating Mangar and his minions once and for all.CityGarth's Equipment ShoppeAdventurer's Guild - Central community for adventurers. This is where the game starts, where characters are created and recruited, and where the game is saved.Garth's Equipment Shoppe - The one and only supply of armor and weapons in Skara Brae. Garth has an unlimited supply of basic adventuring gear.Review Board - Judge and jury of character advancement. The board will determine if the player characters have enough experience for advancement, and will sell spells to those they deem appropriate.Roscoe's Energy Emporium - While spell points recharge over time, Roscoe will replenish them instantly for a hefty fee.Temple PriestsTemples - Temples will cure ailments in return for a donation. The temple priests can return lost hit points, cure diseases and ailments, and raise the dead.Taverns - Scattered throughout the city, taverns are places of respite for weary adventurers. Here the player can catch up on the local gossip, down a pint to return a lost voice, and find all manner of the unexpected.Unmarked Buildings - The city is filled with run-of-the-mill buildings of no particular use. Many of these have been inhabited by Mangar's dark followers and are a prime location for battle for beginning adventurers. The buildings are typically populated by single groups of up to eight enemies.DungeonsExploring The Wine CellarUnlike the city, encounters in the dungeons and castles are with as many as four different groups of enemies. While only the first two groups are within melee range, other groups can still attack at range, and even advance between rounds. Defeated enemies will leave behind chests containing gold and experience, as well booby traps periodically.Wine Cellar - Rumor has it that the wine cellars below a local tavern hold more than dusty wine bottles, and that the followers of Mangar roam the corridors in even greater numbers than the city streets.Sewers - Even darker creatures are rumored to inhabit the sewers under the wine cellar, from poisonous spiders to half-breed creatures to strange monks dressed in green.Only the heartiest party should adventure to these depths.Catacombs - Beneath one of the local temples, the moans of undead hordes can be heard from the ancient catacombs. Followers of Mangar the Dark and the mad god await in the depths.Harkyn's CastleKylearan's TowerMangar's Lair[CR]Magic[CR]The four character code needed to cast is given after the spell name.

Most are virtually the same apart from their image, but the following are notable.Barbarians are a dreaded foe early in the gameBarbarians - Encountered at the beginning of the game they often come in large groups. They are tougher than the average monster and can be very treacherous for a beginning party.Magicians - They have the same spells as hero Magicians and often cast Wither Strike on party members, aging them prematurely. Best to take them out as early as possible. Magicians are encountered from the beginning of the game, but particularly in the wine cellar and sewers, where they like to cast from the back ranks.Black Widows &amp; Spinners- A successful hit will poison the target. This can be cured at the temple, which is very expensive, or with the Flesh Restore spell. These are encountered beginning in the sewers.Sorcerers - An early enemy with a group attack, they will often cast Warstrike, damaging the entire party. Sorcerers are first encountered in the lower sewers.Wights &amp; Demons - Nasty foes that have a withering touch. Wights are found starting in the sewers, and demons are summoned by Wizards in the castle. Dragons are formidable foesWraith - A single touch from this foe will turn its victim insane. Found primarily in the castle, but also found occasionally in hidden corners of the catacombs.Dopplegangers - They can attack the party from even the back reaches of the battle. Found in the lower catacombs and castle.Dragons - Feared foes whose breath engulfs all ranks of the party in combat. Found in the lower reaches of the catacombs and the castle.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]When creating a party, remember that only the first three party members (not including the special member) are in melee range. The last three should have skills that do not require physical attack, such as a bard or spellcasters.While in the city, the player can still summon a stone elemental for aid in combat (using the "z" key).New characters are created with money, but no equipment. The player can create some new members and take their gold.If the player leaves the Adventurer's Guild and does not return (from exiting the game, for example) all of the party's gold will be lost in the corresponding last Adventurer's Guild  save. This can be avoided by manually backing up and restoring the character files (*.TBW). This can be useful early in the game, when gold is hard to accumulate and death is more frequent. Note that this only works if the files are backed up or restored while the game is not running.The state of the world does not persist from session to session, or even when changing dungeon levels.Bards can only play one song per experience level before needing a drink.Before changing casters to Sorcerers, consider switching them to the other starting class (Conjurers to Magicians, Magicians to Conjurers). Not only will they retain the spells of their old class and gain the spells of their new class, but the experience point requirements per level are the same as if they were beginning characters, so advancing through the spell levels will be much faster -- and they gain the extra spell points and hit points!Be careful when using illusionary monsters. Some enemies will not believe them and the illusion will disappear.[CR]Additional Information[CR]The original full title of the game is Tales of the Unknown, Volume I: The Bard's Tale. This was planned to be the first in a trilogy of Tales of the Unknown, each for a different class with the first being the bard. But the game was so successful and the name became so iconic they renamed the series as The Bard's Tale.The Archmage Ybarra referenced in the game was named after  Joe Ybarra, one of the game's developers and co-founder of  Electronic Arts.Characters from both  Wizardy and  Ultima III can be imported into the game.[CR]Compatability[CR]Bard's Tale can still be played on modern PC operating systems like Microsoft Windows Vista and XP with emulators like  DOSBox.

			<title_clean>The Black Cauldron</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Black Cauldron is a graphical adventure game that was released in 1986 by Sierra Entertainment for the PC and equivalents (such as the Amiga and the Apple II). The game was designed by Al Lowe, a veteran adventure game designer who was also responsible for the Leisure Suit Larry series, Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist, and Torin's Passage.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Unlike many other Sierra adventure games of the era, The Black Cauldron was based on a licensed property: a 1985 Disney animated film directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich. The film itself, and to some degree the game, is based on The Chronicles of Prydain books, written by Lloyd Alexander. The Black Cauldron game's story revolves around pig herder Taran. When Taran's magical pig Hen Wen is kidnapped by the evil Horned King, Taran sets off to win his magic pig back.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Black Cauldron is notable for several reasons. First, the game features a dynamic storyline, with branching plots and multiple endings. Second, in order to make the game more accessible and easier to control, the designers eschewed the traditional text parser system in the favor of a function key system which mapped specific actions (Inventory, Look, Use, etc.) to a respective F-Key.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Black Tiger</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]"Long Long ago, three dragons descended from skies above with a rolling thunder and destroyed a kingdom into darkness. From lengthy suffering and darkness of the kingdom came one brave fighter."[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Black Tiger is a single player action-adventure platformer designed &#8211; as most arcade games were &#8211; to extract quarters from the player&#8217;s pocket as rapidly as possible. As such, death and damage to the player&#8217;s limited health comes frequently from traps and surprise attacks from enemies. This is compensated by the vast majority of dangers having static spawn points and audio cues, allowing players to learn placement in the levels through (expensive) experience. Completing the game involves surviving eight stages and defeating the final boss, using as many continues as required.The player has a limited number of lives, separate reservoirs of health and armor, and every stage has a short time limit that can be extended. The player can only attack left and right with a long chained whip, but can do so at any time &#8211; i.e. while jumping or climbing &#8211; and also throws daggers in a 30 degree upward spread. When poisoned, the player turns a shade of purple and daggers no longer appear, weakening attacks significantly.Level DesignThe levels are short and may have briefly branching paths, designated by arrows that are colored when leading to the end of the stage, and desaturated when pointing to a side-path for item collection. Additional side-routes in every level through &#8220;dungeons&#8221; result in bonus points, extra time and zenny. These are clearly identified by a doorway marked "IN" and can only be completed once per level. Losing a life within the dungeon exits the player back to the doorway in the level. At the end of every stage is a mini-boss or dragon boss, and the mini-bosses become regular enemies in later stages.Shops, Items, Inventory and CollectiblesA signature feature of Black Tiger is the stone statues of old men, revived upon touching them. They may offer helpful hints, useless advice, add extra time, extra zenny, or let the player shop. The shop prices vary depending on platform and region in which the game was released, with the Japan releases (Black Dragon) being the most expensive and the UK releases the least costly. Within the shops it is possible to purchase weapon upgrades of stronger blade variants at the end of the whip, armor upgrades in increments of two up to a maximum of eight, chest keys and antidotes; the items never change throughout the game.Vases and locked chests are plentiful in every level. These containers may award points, zenny, extra time, trigger traps or spawn enemies. Chest keys and bottles of poison antidote appear as pickups, as there may not be a store nearby. Chests will only open when holding keys, and poison will not afflict the player when holding antidotes. POW pickups are strategically placed in the levels to clear the screen of most enemies when collected.Special items are also hidden behind breakable sections of walls. These sections can be located by a red puff of smoke - instead of the usual blue - when the player&#8217;s daggers impact on the walls. These items normally take the appearance of sprites seen in other Capcom games, such as barrels, bamboo, and the yashichi. These items award points, free armor upgrades, or 1-Ups.Enemies and TrapsThe variety of enemy design is broken up as the game progresses by color palette changes, which indicate stronger variants. In later levels enemies are far more likely to appear from pots and ambush the player.Falling Boulder - one of the most common, an audio cue warns before a boulder falls down from the top of the screen, sometimes they are visible before being triggeredChest Trap - an audio cue warns before jets of fire erupt in front of the chest and travel either left or rightSpiked/Bottomless Pit - the proof of platformer, poor jumping can result in instant deathRed Gas/Flame Jet - shoots horizontally out of certain walls for a short distance, hazardous when exploring for hidden itemsBlue Gas/Confuse Jet - same as above but also reverses left/right controls temporarily if player has no antidotesSkull Disc ("Spinning Scull") - indestructible spinning &#8220;coins&#8221; that have a small horizontal range of movementMan-Eating Plant - appears from floor at steady intervals, stuns, inflicts poison and damageBlob - very common enemy that can duck under weapon attacks and chase the playerBat - typically spawns in pairs and vulnerable to attack for a few moments before swooping at the playerSnake - coiled and stationary on climbable columnsTiger - sorry, there are no tigersMummy - typically emerge in succession from the background out of caves or other black areas, breathes fire and leapsOrc/Ogre - relentlessly approach the player once spotted or attacked, carries a shield but easily stunned by daggersSkeleton - spawn infinitely on multiple platforms, can jump and throw heads to attack from a distance, always drops 1 zenny coins which can be farmed if there is enough time on the clockFire Demon - stationary but attacks with omnidirectional fireballs that damage for as long as the player is in contact with it, moving fireballs can be blocked by player attacks.Reaper/Warlock - appears in mid-air to attack with fire pillars, turns invisible and teleports when hit, must be attacked numerous times.Stoneface block - after being awoken by proximity, leaps and tries to crush the playerRed Imp - transforms from a floating sphere to a fly rapidly and hurl spearsDragon - the three dragon bosses (red, blue and black) each have distinct attack patterns and are essentially battles of attritionStrategies and TipsWeaponry should always be considered the first investment of zenny, as weapons persist after player death while the level of armor will always reset to 2. There are also free hidden pickups that will raise the armor level.While poisoned, the player will only brandish the chained weapon and not throw the usual spread of 3 daggers. This cuts attack power significantly and enemies will be more difficult to stun and kill.When fighting the first dragon, always crouch to attack when it comes close. This makes the player immune to damage while touching the dragon itself.After returning from a shop screen, any enemies that were previously attacking on screen when the statue was touched will be reset.There is a limited amount of air control immediately after jumping, but not while falling. To reach high platforms, hold up while jumping then immediately move in the direction of the platform to complete the arc.[CR]Distribution and Conversions[CR]While most released ports for Black Tiger have been on various computer systems, it was briefly announced in development for the NES, but was never released.Emulation of Black Tiger outside of MAME manifested in the 1990s with the dedicated emulator Btishger, which became known for excellent playability in all areas except sound accuracy.Atari ST / AmigaThe U.S. Gold published conversion for the Atari ST and Amiga was done by Graham Lilley, with artwork redrawn by Taoman Irmak.Virtual Console ArcadeIn late 2010/early 2011 the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console Arcade in Japan and the U.S., using 60 blocks of Wii memory. Like other VCA games, various graphical, control, and &#8220;dip-switch&#8221; settings can be tweaked as desired. Changing the video settings to 100%/100% with 2 scanlines gives a reasonably faithful appearance to the arcade game.Xbox Live Arcade/PSNIn February 2013, Black Tiger was released on the Xbox Live Arcade store and the Playstation Network as part of the first Capcom Arcade Cabinet pack, alongside 1943 and Avengers.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Bolo is a "Breakout" clone with a twist. You have to destroy all the bricks on the screen using your paddle to go to the next level but, in Bolo, your paddle is not restricted to the bottom of the screen -- it can move all around the screen, giving a whole new dimension to the "breakout" concept.[CR]The game includes two different sets of 50 levels each, randomly selected when you begin a new game. It also features 46 different types of bricks with different properties, bonuses and penalties. [CR]The main menu allows you to access Training mode, from which you can select to play any of the 100 available layouts.[CR]Bolo's graphics are black and white only, but the game can be played either on a monochrome or color monitor. The graphics are however much sharper on a monochrome monitor. The animations are fast and smooth, and the paddle reacts quickly to the mouse movements.</plot>

			<plot>The sequel to the 1989 game Waterloo takes us back to the village of Borodino on the 7th of September, 1812, during the bloodiest battle of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.As in the previous game, the player is observing the battle area through a 3D perspective while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text commands that are combined with the names of commanders, places, and the time of execution. Players receive reports from their officers indicating whether or not the orders have been carried out to the letter.</plot>

			<title_clean>Bubble Ghost</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubble Ghost is a puzzle game first released on the Atari ST by French developer Christophe Andreani. It was first published by ERE Informatique in its home country before being localized for the rest of Europe and North America by Infogrames (which would also absorb ERE Informatique) for various other home computers, like the C64, DOS and Commodore Amiga. It would also be adapted for the Nintendo Game Boy by Japanese developers Opera House the following year, which was released worldwide by FCI (Europe/NA) and Pony Canyon (Japan).The goal of the game is to escort a bubble from one side of the screen to the other. The player, as a ghost, is able to float around to any side of the bubble and blow at it to move it around the mansion. The ghost cannot interact with any other objects, except to blow on them; for instance, it can blow out a candle that would otherwise pop the bubble with its heat. By navigating the bubble around all the traps on the screen, some of which work unexpectedly, the player can move ahead. If the bubble pops, the ghost gives the player an angry look and they lose a life.The Game Boy port was scored by future prominent video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto. It was his first solo project.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In this traditional baseball simulation, gameplay takes place mainly on a split screen.One side shows an overview of the field, the other showing the batter, with the latter view disappearing when the ball is hit.[CR]The game requires you to "draft" a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.</plot>

			<plot>Conqueror is a polygonal isometric-view tank action/strategy game with an elaborate control system (emulating "real" tank controls on normal joysticks) and two-player possibilities by switching the controls to use one joystick each for gunner and driver.[CR]The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on.[CR]To top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player and can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission..</plot>

			<plot>Cricket Captains have a much greater role than their equivalents in most sports. Most major tactical decisions during the match ultimately come under their control, as they do in this simulation, in which you can play or merely watch the match action. Teams are real but the player names are fictitious.[CR]Your options are quite similar to those of a soccer manager. You must hire a coach, scout and physio to enable you to train your players and keep them fit, and to acquire new ones through the soccer-style transfer market. [CR]You must select your team of 11 players before the match, with talented all-rounders more common than in real-life. The game takes in the four main tournaments of the time - a single-division league of four-day unlimited-overs matches, the Sunday League of one-day games, and two cup competitions.[CR]The match view features a plan view of the fielding setup, and a forced-perspective view of the batsman as a shot is lined up. You must time and place your shot correctly in order to score off it. When fielding you can choose the bowler and alter the field setup.</plot>

			<plot>The Crimson Crown is the sequel to Transylvania, a graphical text adventure for various home computers. This sequel uses the same text parser, but is unique among graphical text adventures of the era, in that companions interact with, and accompany the player. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As in Transylvania, the player interacts with the world through a text interface, using verb-object commands (e.g. "open door") and directional commands (e.g. "North" or simply "N"). Unlike the previous game, The Crimson Crown was written using Polarware's new 'Comprehend' parsing engine --- a new Infocom-style full sentence parser. This allows more complex phrasing, and a more immersive experience. Unlike the more common text adventures of the era, the current area is rendered, giving the player a sense of presence.The Crimson Crown begins shortly after the events in Transylvania. After rescuing princess Sabrina, the King is found dead, his crown stolen by the Vampire Drakul (a nod to 'Dracula'). The player embarks with Princess Sabrina and Crown Prince Erik to retake the crown, and destroy Drakul. The player must overcome puzzles, a witch, and trolls, and seek help from a Gryphon along the way. Certain locations from the first game are re-used.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Although less popular than Transylvania, the series would go on to a third and final chapter five years later.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Dark Castle</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dark Castle is the first game in the    Dark Castle series, and was released in 1986 for the   Macintosh. It was one of the first computer (or video) games to use fully recorded samples for      voices and sound effects, and although they were small in number the corresponding effects for yammering      mutants and dizzy  Prince Duncan were quite remarkable, especially when combined with the detailed backgrounds.The game starts with you - as Prince Duncan - entering the Black Knight's castle and the gate slams shuts behind you. In order to escape, you have to trek through      caves, dungeons, and a tower surrounded by perpetual lightning clouds before you're well equipped enough to take on the Black Knight himself.The game uses a WASD control scheme, lets you duck with Q and jump with the spacebar and aim and throw rocks with the mouse. There was a later Sega Genesis version that featured colour, but the horrific controls implemented for rock throwing almost made the game unplayable due to lack of accuracy. [CR]The Levels[CR] Great Hall Great HallOnce inside the castle you're presented with four exits - two doors on the left, a main double-door in the center and a narrow staircase up on the right side. Each is accessed by tapping the corresponding number key.The first two doors are arguably the most frustrating aspect of Dark Castle, since they're random. You have a 50% chance of exiting the side of the castle and embarking on your brief journey to earn      fireballs, and a 50% chance of getting throw down to the dungeon. DungeonUnfortunately, if you end up in the dungeon, the door locks behind you and you must trek through three screens, get the key, and trek back again, and you're no further ahead (alternatively you could just cheat and restart your game). Final area of dungeon (or first, if you fall in)You also end up in the dungeon if you fall into any of the game's pits - they are far fewer in number than in the original, though, as there are only two or three screens (of more than a dozen) that lead to the dungeon. Once there, you must      sneak up on the      torturer, whack him in the back of the head with a morning star, then leap over his unconcious body and grab the correct key before leaping back again. Time it wrong, grab the wrong key, or take too long and allow him to wake up again, and you're dead. Even if you do earn the key, you have to rock-throw, jump, and run your way back to the main hall again, resulting in an awful lot of painstaking      backtracking (in other words, don't fall in pits if you can help it).  Outer CastleIf you do get the correct door, you get to cross a small plain guarded by rock-throwing, gurgling mutants that constantly respawn and      climb three sets of ropes (allowing you to swap between them to avoid mutants climbing down at you). The following room has a number of moving platforms, requiring very careful jumping. It's the first area where use of the games' different jumps becomes essential - Prince Duncan jumps higher, lower, or longer depending on the direction you hold while tapping jump, and he cannot fall like      Mario. Falling more than twice his height will almost always result in death.Once past the platforming segment there is  a brief river rapids through dank tunnels and finally you meet up with the reclusive      wizard, who will gently anoint you with the gift of fireballs, allowing you to throw them instead of regular rocks. Of course, if you reach him without first obtaining the shield from the lightning tower, his magic spell will instead char you to a crisp. Lightning TowerThe left stairwell doesn't take you directly to the tower - where would be the challenge in that? Instead, the first room is a vague homage to      Donkey Kong, with rocks bouncing back and forth, descending level by level. Since Prince Duncan moves like the      Prince of Persia (that is to say, a bit more deliberate than your average Mario-esque platforming mascot) the best route is simply to sneak up ladder by ladder, pausing midway through for the next rock to bounce past. It is possible to duck under or jump over rocks, but this requires an awful lot of skill and patience.Getting hit by a rock while jumping or climbing near the left side of the level won't kill you like it will anywhere else - it'll send you down to the dungeon.The second screen pits you against divebombing vultures (all pattern based) and a firebreathing      dragon. Since your rocks are completely ineffective against the dragon, you have to climb the stairs and jump to the platform above him, dumping the pot of hot oil on his head in order to make him retreat back inside the tower.After hurrying into the hole left by the dragon, Duncan must navigate along a series of ropes and poles. The poles are distinguished by their solid colouring and are a very bad idea - shuffling over to a pole instead of a rope results in you slipping, which send you not to your death but, yes, the dungeon.The final portion of your task involves leaping diagonally up a series of disappearing platforms, which change in such a way that you must zigzag your way up and down and sideways in order to make it to the very top without dizzying yourself or cracking your skull open on the hard stone floor. The top of the room is the top of the tower itself, with a moving thundercloud that occasionally fires out a bolt of lightning. Avoiding that and grabbing the shield at the end will cause the cloud to home in on you, and you must activate the shield just before it zaps, warping you back to the great hall. Black Knight's SanctuaryThe double-doors in the center lead you to the Black Knight. It should be noted that the game never explicitly states that you need the shield and fireballs to complete the game, but it is physically impossible to navigate the rope/platform maze in the first room before you hear a loud barking/whooping noise.That noise is the gargoyle, who is immune to regular rocks and will fly over to you (wherever you are), pick you up, and toss you into the pit to the dungeon. The only way to kill him is to have the fireball upgrade, and that's the only way you're finishing that level.Once navigated past that you'll end up against the Black Knight himself, who sits in his throne in the middle of the room. There are four switches in each corner of the area that must be pulled in order to defeat him, and as you run and climb he'll toss beer mugs at you. These can be avoided, but it's much easier to just tap the shield button as they fly through you. It's a bit anticlimatic, but once all the switches are pulled, you complete the game and your high score is recorded on the main menu. [CR]The Enemies[CR] Enemies of Dark CastleThere are not many enemies in Dark Castle, but the ones that are present are quite distinct from one another.Altering the difficulty on the main menu changes the level completion bonuses you earn as well as the placement and number of enemies - it also affects how long certain enemies stay stunned when hit by your rocks. Needless to say, there will be many more (and less forgiving) enemies on advanced difficulty as opposed to beginner.  BatBats are probably the most common enemy in the game other than rats. When you enter a level they will be curled up at a particular point, sleeping, and will not awake for about five seconds. You can use that time to hit them from afar and smile to yourself as their lifeless corpse plummets to the ground with a splat, or you can wait for them to wake up and take advantage of a closer target as they fly towards you. They have no real pattern other than a general desire to fly straight towards you and kill you, which is a reasonable urge given Duncan's proficiency with rocks. RatRats are very uninteresting - they cannot kill you instantly, however, so you can touch one ever so briefly while running fast. Just don't linger, or they'll turn you stone cold dead. They have no pattern and simply wander back and forth on whatever ledge or floor they're on. Killing one starts a hidden timer, and after a while a new rat pops out of the appropriate rat hole and charges forth, so time the kills and your dashes well. GuardThe guards wander back and forth in much the same way as the rats - they're just bigger, invincible, and carry crossbows. The guards will only fire when facing you and while you're on the same level as them, although their crossbow bolts are subject to gravity and will lose a bit of altitude if you're all the way on the other side of the screen. Hitting them with a rock will make a thunderous tin can noise and knock them unconscious for about ten seconds, giving you time to sneak past. If you have fireballs, of course, you can kill them outright. Guards are only found in the dungeon. MutantMutants can throw rocks - not well, but they can throw rocks. They have a single, grotesque eyeball in the center of their bodies, massive hands, and yammer and gurgle unintelligibly while waving their arms and smacking their bottoms at you. Occasionally they stop this display in order to hurl a rock in your general direction. Mutants can also descend ropes, and (like rats) will respawn shortly after being killed, up to whatever number of mutants are supposed to be in a particular group. Burning EyeThe burning eye is a gigantic floating eyeball that is, well, on fire. It slowly glides in your direction and only stops when you hit it with a rock. Your reprieve is only temporary, however, and you'll have to stop your platforming occasionally in order to stun the eye before it gets too close to you. Of course, if you're lucky enough to have them, fireballs will drop the eye for good.  [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]If you load Dark Castle when your system clock is set to Halloween (October 31st), a number of the enemies will be altered to fit the Halloween theme, such as pumpkin heads and candy. Similarly, when you set the system clock to Christmas (December 25), there is a Christmas tree in the foyer. The game also responds to setting the system clock to any Friday the 13th.The game also replaces the tilde (~) key with a castle icon, which you can use when entering high scores.Dark Castle for the Mac required a very specific (and streamlined) version of the Macintosh 7 operating system, requiring a boot diskette even for Macs with an internal hard drive. However, even with the game files and OS on the same disk it fit on a regular single density 3.5" floppy.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>This game is the sequel to Mr. Do's Wild Ride and the fourth title in the "Mr. Do!" series. You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched.To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus.On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.</plot>

			<title_clean>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II centers around the murder of MarianOriginally released in 1988 as an arcade game, Double Dragon II: The Revenge is the sequel to Double Dragon, which was released in 1987. Double Dragon II once again stars Jimmy and Billy Lee as they investigate the murder of Marian, the love interest of the series. Marian was shot to death by a group known as the Black Warriors. Other than the original arcade release, there have been a variety of home console versions, including releases for the NES, Game Boy, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Amiga. These versions all differ in a variety of ways, from minor elements to major gameplay changes.On March 10, 1990, Meldac released the soundtrack of Double Dragon II: The Revenge in Japan. Featuring new renditions of the songs from the NES version of the game, including arranged songs and a pop remix of the opening theme, with vocals sung by Manami Morozumi. The soundtrack, composed by Kazuhiro Hara and Nobuhito Tanahashi, contains 13 songs, two of which are different renditions of the same song (Dead or Alive, one with lyrics and one without).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade Version The first level in the arcade game.The original arcade release is essentially the same as its predecessor. The game is a side scrolling beat-em-up, in which players can fight enemies across a four stages: an airport, lumberhouse, a field, and the base of operations for the Black Warriors. The largest differences between the original Double Dragon and Double Dragon II are improved moves, range of attack, and control scheme. In Double Dragon, players could either kick or punch. Double Dragon II changes this, and opts instead for directional based attacks (e.g. if the player is facing to the right, one button will send out a flurry of punches and the other button will have the character kick from the back).In addition to friendly characters, all of the enemies have received significant makeovers as well. As well as a range of new enemy characters (including the final boss, Willy, leader of the Black Warriors), enemies now have new weapons to carry around and use, including shovels and hand grenades. Enemy attacks are also modified, including a new range of combos and special attacks (to combat the new moves that Jimmy and Billy have received, such as the Hurricane Kick).NES Version The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard.Possibly the most well known version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, the NES version was originally released on December 23, 1989 in Japan, and then later released in North America during January of 1990. Published by Acclaim Entertainment and developed by Technos, Double Dragon II for the NES is very different from the arcade version on which it is based. Similar to the previous NES game, Double Dragon, this NES game is a one to two player side scrolling beat-em-up, although this was the first version of a Double Dragon game on the NES that could be played by two players simultaneously in co-op. The game has an expanded story, including cutscenes before each stage (of which there are nine). In addition, there is a separate final boss in the NES version, which can only be fought on the hardest difficult level. Upon being defeated, Marian is brought back to life (unlike the arcade version).The Lee brothers retain the bi-directional attacks from the arcade version (with B and A on the NES pad corresponding to Left and Right attacks, respectively) as well as the spinning Hurricane Kick special move. In addition, they can execute "hyper" uppercut and "hyper" flying knee attacks, which send enemies flying skyward and backwards, respectively. The latter move is particularly useful for making quick work of enemies (including boss characters) when fighting near a bottomless pit area. While the Hurricane Kick can be executed on the fly by jumping and then tapping both buttons at the peak of the jump, the latter two must be executed by timing button presses almost perfectly when the player character is just exiting his kneeling frame of animation (initiated by either landing from a jump or getting up from a fall), making them slightly more complex moves to pull off.Stage design (as well as several new stages with story sequences playing out before each one), modes, and the plot changes are all among the differences between the arcade and NES versions of Double Dragon II. Arguably the largest change is the addition of a two-player "Mode B", where the players can damage each other during the game - this factor was subsequently used to discover a number of exploits and shortcuts by the speedrun community. (Another side effect of "Mode B" was that if one player killed another, the first player would gain the life that the other player lost, something that could be used to give a single player up to 7 lives.) Additionally, Double Dragon II on the NES adds five new stages, differing enemies, radically different stage design, and a new final boss (named the Mysterious Warrior).Other VersionsOther than the well-known arcade and NES versions, there have been a variety of other ports of Double Dragon II: The Revenge. Two other home console ports were produced in 1991 and 1993 (both exclusively in Japan) for the Sega Mega Drive and the PC Engine respectively. The Mega Drive version is largely unchanged from the arcade game, only slightly altering the second stage. The PC Engine version featured upgraded graphics (including the story sequences from the NES version, which are redone for this version), new music, slightly altered stage design, and voice acting for the main characters, including Billy, Jimmy, and Marian.Several ports were released for PC platforms as well, with Virgin Mastertronic and Binary Design handling ports to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST in 1989. These companies were the same companies to handle the PC ports of the original Double Dragon as well.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrackDead or Alive (2:48)The Vengeful Demon has Begun to Move (3:37)A Quiet Pursuit (3:01)Tension at the Night Sky (1:43)Advancing Towards Sunset (2:25)Escape to the Forest (3:43)Wicked God (1:25)Breaking the Barrier (2:37)Enter to the Enemy's Base (3:19)Roar of the Twin Dragons (3:55)Miracle of the Twin Dragons (1:25)Sweet Memories (3:13)[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Drakkhen is an RPG released in 1989 for the Atari ST and Amiga. It was originally published by Infogrames, a French company that eventually became Atari SA. It was eventually ported to the MS-DOS with several additions, and then to the Super Nintendo by Kemco in 1991.The game had a few novel features for the time, including an open 3D overworld (actually just an effect created by vectors and sprite-scaling, similar to the SNES's Mode 7) and a real-time day/night cycle. It received a SNES-only sequel Dragon View, known in Japan as Super Drakkhen.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player needs to explore the environment with their group of adventurers, visiting various castles to solve the quest that been given to them. The player can also choose to wander off the path and explore the countryside, though various dangers await to quickly slay an under-leveled party.Combat is done automatically whenever the party encounters an enemy. The adventurers wander into the first-person view and fight the creatures they've encountered until either side is defeated or the player decides to flee. Characters switch to this third-person view inside locations as well.Among the many regular monsters the group can encounter, there are also dragons that can be found by wandering too far away as well as several "special" monsters that can be fought when certain conditions are met. These include a colossal panther head that strikes if the group interferes with any graves in any way, powerful beings that descend from space should the party look up at specific constellations, and the chilling "Shadow Man" - a fully black humanoid figure who emerges from the ground to an ominous tune. These creatures are almost certain death, especially to low-level parties, and will often eradicate confused newcomers who stray off the beaten path.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Electronic Pool is a simplified cue sports game with only six billiard balls on the table. The game offers two different game modes. In 1-player mode your goal is to pocket the balls in as few shots as possible and try to get as high a score as possible. Missing too many shots means an early game over. In 2-player mode you try to get more points than your opponent to win the game.</plot>

			<plot>A shoot em up set on a patchwork-quilt coloured road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed. There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one youve currently got.</plot>

			<plot>Published in 1983 by  Infocom, Enchanter is an Interactive Fiction game written by  Marc Blank and  Dave Lebling. The game takes place in the  Zork universe. This was the first game in " The Enchanter Trilogy" which included Enchanter,  Sorcerer, and  SpellBreaker. The game puts the player in the shoes of a novice Enchanter sent against the dark necromancer Krill. The player is sent by the Enchanters' Guild in the hope that the mighty sorcerer will either not notice so lowly a wizard, or not see him as a threat. The game, in its boxed format, shipped with a Directory of Guilds, an Enchanters' Guild Pin, a Scroll listing the spells "Frotz", "Gnusto", "Nitfol", and "Blorb", a map of locations in the game, and a booklet entitled "A Brief History of Magic."[CR]</plot>

			<plot>This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.</plot>

			<title_clean>Fantasy World Dizzy</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Like all the core Dizzy games, the character is able to move and jump through a world full of dangers and puzzles to solve. The underlying concept of Fantasy World Dizzy is that all of Dizzy's friends (the Yolkfolk) have been magically ensorcelled with various fairy-tale curses and Dizzy must rescue them all. The game is non-linear, allowing the player to travel in any direction they wish. However, certain obstacles will restrict movement around the map until they are dealt with. This can be done by collecting items (Dizzy has inventory space for three) and applying them where necessary to solve puzzles and facilitate progress. Eventually, Dizzy must find all his friends, use items to rescue them from their various enchanted plights and then finally locate his girlfriend Daisy. For the best ending, Dizzy must also have collected 30 gold coins scattered throughout the game, usually in hard to reach or well-hidden places.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Internet critic Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw often calls the game one of his favorites.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Fast Food Dizzy</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Like Pac-Man and others in the older "maze" genre (such as Jungler or Amidar), Dizzy is placed in a maze and must chase down all the food items to proceed to the next stage. He must also avoid all the ghosts, which appear to be taken directly from Pac-Man, but are instead named Wizza, Pippa, Fido and Bonzo. Similar to Pac-Man, players are treated to small animated vignettes after every three stages, which will also give the player an extra life.Differences from Pac-ManMaze complexity - Many mazes are not symmetrical and the visual theme will change every few levels. They can include dead-ends and "safe zones", which the ghosts cannot enter.Food - The food items Dizzy needs to eat are constantly moving and, like the ghosts, all have their own personalities. One of the dumbest being, of course, the Hamburger.Power-Ups - Dizzy can also collect various power-ups that wander around in much the same way the food and ghosts do. They confer both helpful and not-so-helpful temporary abilities on Dizzy and the other moving elements.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Football coin-op conversion. Large sprites and small playing field. Passing is not important as the main emphasis is on winning the ball and running with it. Very difficult to keep hold of the ball when you are in possession as the opposition defenders have a lot more pace than the player with the ball so games tend to be a melee in the middle of the field of players all frantically tackling each other for possession.</plot>

			<plot>The Fire Brigade was the 48th Panzer Korps, which was heavily involved in the battle this wargame recreates - Operation Barbarossa, Germany's attempted offensive in Russia during World War 2. The game recreates the situations at 3 dates in the attack, and you can play any of those from either side.You have a range of units under your command, as although the battle was largely tank-based there were also infantry and air units involved. Units can be told which positions to take up, and whether to defend a spot or consciously aim to attack it. The game's AI incorporates the significance of bridges, rivers and forests as strategic points, and your units can be subject to fatigue.</plot>

			<plot>Tynesoft were almost certainly the first people to try a first person  pinball game with this ambitious program. Up to four players could join in, including 2 computer players to show you how it's done. The game can be played from a more traditional overhead-view mode, which makes it easier to tell where the bumpers are in relation to the flippers, and is recommended for learning the game. Most of those bumpers are single-colour and arranged in a straightforward pattern. There are three different gameplay speeds and 2 possible levels of ball bounce.</plot>

			<title_clean>Flip-It and Magnose - Water Carriers from Mars</title_clean>
			<plot>Flip-it &amp; Magnose, the title characters of this action game with strong puzzle elements, live on Mars. Unfortunately the planet has not exactly the biggest water resources of the universe and so they are sent to Earth to get some. In the vertically scrolling platform levels the player has to solve puzzles by collecting objects and using them at the right place respectively giving them to the right people. However, the water is not given directly, but there is a water drop which has to be caught by using the water catcher object. The goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of water within the time limit.The player character can't die, but loses fruit when he falls too much of a distance. Fruit can be collected when wandering through the levels and are used between the six levels to buy traps which have different effects (and of course different prices), e.g. wasting a bit of time or reversing the controls. This is useful because the two Martians don't work together and try to beat each other's water score. There are also other items to collect which are not directly related to puzzle solving, like a spring for long jumps and objects which help against special hazards in the level. Collecting pills is a bit of a gamble because they can either add or subtract points on the water or fruit counter. The game uses a split-screen; one half for each Martian. In two-player games, the second Martian is controlled by player two.</plot>

			<plot>Football Manager from Addictive was the first game of its kind, and this sequel followed several years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar games released in between. Teams can now choose formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a more realistic way, with half-time substitutions and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club league is incorporated, as is the League Cup alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch and assess the individual performance of the players, with match graphics differentiating the attack / midfield / defense areas more clearly. Training allows passing length and height to be specified.</plot>

			<plot>Baron Frankenstein has instructed his hunchback servant Egor to collect tools and bodies for him to use in his quest to create artificial life. As Egor, the player must search through Frankenstein's castle, the dungeons, the surrounding forest, the local village and other areas in this side-scrolling platformer. Despite the grim themes, the game is a humorous cartoonish one. Each task begins in Frankenstein's lab with the Baron telling Egor what item he requires. Egor must find it, put it in his sack and return to the lab to receive the next task. Along the way there are enemies such as ghosts, skeletons, rats, bats, animated body parts, local townsfolk and others. Instead of a health bar, Egor has a Frightometer with a range from calm to panic. Touching enemies moves it ever more towards the maximum. Once that is reached, Egor will drop what he is carrying, flee to the lab and in so doing lose a life. There is a way of reducing the meter, though: meeting up with the local serving wench will calm Egor's nerves and return it to zero. It is also reset when an item has been delivered.Once Egor has found and returned the weather chart requested by Frankenstein, the game introduces a time limit. The timer starts at around 74 minutes and counts down to the electrical storm that will bring the monster to life. Failing to collect all required items within the limit means the end of the game.</plot>

When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.</plot>

Gauntlet was the first arcade cabinet to feature four player cooperative gameplay and it caused a sensation in the Arcade when it was released in 1985.[CR][B]Classes:[/B][CR]The character classes in Gauntlet are the: Thor the Warrior, Merlin the Wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Questor the Elf whose colors are red, yellow, blue and green, respectively.Each character has its own abilities. Thor the Warrior, the slowest character, deals the most damage and is also the most effective character at close range. Merlin the Wizard is a fast character who is not good at close combat but has the most powerful magic, which is activated by using a potion found in the dungeon. Questor the Elf is the fastest character but is weak at close range. His long range shots make him a good scout (the Elf player often irritates other players since his extra speed allows him to steal all the treasure before anyone else can get a look-in!). Finally, Thyra the Valkyrie is the all-rounder who neither excels nor fails in any given department.[CR]Objectives and Gameplay[CR]The objective of Gauntlet is to progress through a massive dungeon with hundreds of levels. On each level the player(s) must reach the exit in order to advance to the next level. However the dungeon's denizens are there to make reaching that exit a tough task. Dungeons are populated by all manner of nasties including: Ghosts, Grunts, Demons, Lobbers and, of course, Death himself! Enemies in Gauntlet commonly spawn from generators and will do so inexorably until the generators are destroyed. Other features of the dungeon include locked doors, secret rooms, and teleporters.Each hero has a numerical value representing their health on the the screen. This number steadily ticks down to zero even when the hero is not taking any damage. Since vast hordes of enemies are all competing for a chunk of the heroes health, it is not an easy task to survive in Gauntlet. One remedy for this rapidly diminishing health for the arcade version is to drop more coins into the slot to buy more health points. Food pick-ups are also scattered around the dungeon which boost the health of whoever collects them. Unfortunately, food only gives the hero another 100 points of health, which doesn't last long.To make life a little easier for the heroes there are power-ups which can be collected; these include temporary invisibility, an armor boost, and extra shot speed or power. Since all characters occupy the same game screen, a good deal of cooperation is required in order for a group of players to successfully navigate the levels. A good team will fairly distribute the bonuses to the most suitable hero, i.e. "let the Wizard have the potions". A bad Elf player can spoil the groups chances by snatching everything!One of the most memorable features of Gauntlet is the audio. The game has an announcer who, in all his 8-bit glory, declaims important messages such as "Wizard shot the food!" or "Warrior needs food badly!" At the time, it was impressive that a game had audible speech in 1985, which was novel.[CR]Gauntlet's Origins[CR]Gauntlet was originally a copy, with some upgrades, of a game by John Palevich, who contributed his dungeon crawler to Atari through the Atari Program eXchange. Palevich later sued for compensation, or at least name recognition in the credits of the Gauntlet arcade games. Atari was said to have recognized Palevich's role in the creation of Gauntlet, but as the arcade machines were already made, they maintained that adding Palevich's name would have been prohibitively expensive. Palevich was later given token compensation from Atari in recognition of his unwitting role in the creation of this game.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Goldrunner II is set 50 years after the events of its predecessor. Since then humanity has started to use robot pilots for defense, but space pirates have managed to capture them. The hero, the grandchild of the original Goldrunner, now has to save or at least destroy the robots before they can be used against their creators.To do so he flies through 16 vertically scrolling levels, called platforms, to shoot down the transporters carrying the robots. Then he collects the robots (the capacity is up to five at a time) flies to the teleporter station, unloads and repeats until all robots in the level are captured or destroyed. Well, it is not that easy: every destroyed transporter causes recovery ships - basically enemy fighters and mines - to show up, which need to be destroyed first. The game also features dust clouds which block the ship's shots and smart bombs which destroy all enemies on the screen when used.</plot>

To do so, the player has to change the altitude of the space ship - but flying low creates the danger of crashing into another building. Fuel and shields can be replenished by flying over especially marked buildings. Of course there is also alien opposition which is dealt with by shooting them.

			<title_clean>Ikari Warriors</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ikari Warriors, first released in 1986, was SNK's first true Arcade hit in the United States. Its distinctive controls and two-player mode set it apart from other top-down shooters, such as Commando. In Ikari Warriors, the players controls Ralf Jones and Clark Steel, two characters who later joined the King of Fighters roster. Players take control of Ralf and Clark, and fight through enemy units to try and save the village of Ikari.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ikari Warriors can be played single-player or two-player co-op. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with players seeing the top of character's heads. The players are on the bottom of the screen, and advance upwards, while fighting through hordes of enemies. Players must be aware of how much ammunition they have, as it is limited. Tanks, which have armor that prevents our heroes from taking damage, can be commandeered throughout the game. However, they will eventually be destroyed by enemy fire.The original Arcade version of Ikari Warriors allows players to move in one direction while firing in another. This is accomplished via a rotating joystick that allows players to aim in any of the eight movement directions. This style of gameplay made Ikari Warriors tough to duplicate in the numerous ports and remakes of the game that appeared on home consoles, with some, like the NES version, ignoring the feature completely and only allowing players to fire in the direction they're facing.Clark and Ralf were required to move quickly in the game. If they loitered for too long, red spots, or tracking fire, would appear below them to get them on the move. Also when playing co-op if one player moved faster than another the slower player could become stuck and would die as a result.[CR]Home Ports[CR]The home versions of the game often departed from the level design of the Arcade game, with the NES version specifically getting a much longer game with more variety than the Arcade version. However, much of this new material was of a lower quality than the Arcade game.The NES version of the game also has one of the most notoriously easy codes in the history of the system, which allows the player to continue from where they left off by pressing A, B, B, A after their last life is lost. The NES version also had a few bugs, like one co-op issue where a player would get dragged through some impassable object by the way the screen scrolls. After passing through the object, the player would be invincible to enemy fire, but invisible walls would often make forward progress tricky or even impossible.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The Alpha 2 research colony on Xelos has been invaded by aliens, wiping out the crew and laying 167 of their eggs, all waiting to hatch into a lethal alien infestation. Superhero Kal Solar is the only one who can prevent a catastrophe, and that's where you come in.[CR]The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.[CR]There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.</plot>

			<title_clean>International Soccer Challenge</title_clean>
			<plot>International Soccer Challenge is loosely a sequel to MicroProse Soccer and it has many similarities to the original, including the way the ball sticks to your player's foot. The major difference is the visual perspective, which is in pure 3D, viewed just behind the ball as you move up the pitch, with full polygons and some shading. You have a radar on screen to allow you to see where your team-mates are, which reduces the disadvantage of not being able to look behind you.[CR]Two tournaments are featured - a superleague and a recreated World Cup, as well as practice modes. By moving the joystick as you shoot, you can adjust the direction and height of a pass or shot, allowing for a wide range of moves.</plot>

			<plot>Pandora's first game combines the Gauntlet style with the World War 2 setting, and specifically the Eagle's Nest building which is being used by a commander as his HQ. Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible.[CR]There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ishar: Legend of the Fortress is a real-time first-person dungeon crawler RPG and the first in Silmarils's  Ishar trilogy. The game has a distinct assortment of systems governing its ruleset regarding combat, recruitment and level progression. It and the other Ishar games are based loosely on Silmarils's earlier RPG Crystals of Arborea, considered by fans to be "Ishar 0". The player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. His quest begins by looking for Jarel's former party members and learning the secrets of Ishar, while simultaneously putting his own party together from honorable warriors encountered across the land.The game was originally released in Europe in 1992 for the Atari ST, Amiga and PC. The game later became available at GOG.com along with its sequels in the Ishar Compilation package.[CR]Minimum System Requirements[CR]Windows XP or Windows Vista1 GHz Processor (1.4 GHz recommended)512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), Mouse, Keyboard.[CR]</plot>

Along the way he will find six bombs which must be activated, leaving him with only 20 minutes to rescue everyone.[CR]Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly.</plot>

			<title_clean>Joe Blade 2</title_clean>
			<plot>As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.[CR]As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.[CR]There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.</plot>

Unfortunately there are many alien space ships which try to prevent this. Being hit by an enemy ship or projectile is deadly. Besides the standard shot the player can activate ultrasonics to get rid of all enemies on the screen or shields which grant invulnerability. Of course those useful items are limited and can be replenished by defeating a whole enemy formation. They can't be activated separately; the shields are always used up first.</plot>

			<plot>Kelly X is a space shoot 'em up played from a first person perspective. The player is a pilot working for the Peace Foundation (a future version of Greenpeace) whose task it is to search space for rogue nuke stations that illegally dump nuclear waste. The objective is simple: destroy the radioactive canisters and the stations as well as the guardian fighters that protect them.  The player controls his space craft in a 3D space with the use of either mouse or joystick. The craft moves forward automatically but the speed can be increased and decreased. Moving left and right causes it to rotate while moving up and down causes it to climb or dive. To take down enemies and waste dumps a simple laser gun is fired. Colliding with or getting shot by enemies lead to the craft's shield depleting and when it's all gone it's game over. A hyperspace function can be used to move to a random location but then the shield will decrease. </plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Players line up colored blocks into various patterns to make them disappear. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch up to five blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Blocks are dropped in order of recency, with the newest block dropped first. Similarly, the player may launch blocks back up the conveyor belt in an attempt to "juggle" them to get the appropriate color ready.ScoringA Klax is the simplest pattern of three matching blocks. Each pattern is a multiplier based on the number of Klaxes it is worth. Four matching tiles in a row, as an example, are worth two Klaxes. Points are scored based on pattern size. The more blocks which are simultaneously removed, the higher the score. Empty space at the end of the round is also scored. After each round, the player may skip 5 or 10 stages, which results in a higher score multiplier, and more available drops. Difficulty is similarly ramped up faster. Stages have unique challenges, such as forming a specific pattern a number of times ("complete 5 diagonals").CompletionFailure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends. (In the original coin-op, the game ends when all drops are used.) Klax has 100 stages, and ends after completing the final stage.[CR]Blob Ball[CR]Blob BallThe NES version of Klax includes Blob Ball under the title screen menu "stuff", a single-player pong-like minigame. The player controls a paddle over a wall of spikes, and deflects a blob to the opposite wall. Either button on the control pad changes the blob's direction unpredictably. There is no score, and unlimited lives. Programmer Dave O'Riva commented in an interview with The Warp Zone:Blob ball was just a lark. I wanted to have some humorous stuff on the cartridge, and the idea for this Pong-like "game" just sprang up. Most of it was coded in one evening, and then refined in "spare time" over the next week. The most common observation on it at the time was "I can't believe they let you ship with that." [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Lords of Conquest</title_clean>
			<plot>Lords of Conquest was an early global domination/war strategy game. Different territories could have resources which could be used to purchase weapons and build cities. Cities would then double the production of the resources in any adjacent territories owned by the player. The battles that took place didn't involve armies like Risk, but rather were based on the 'power' of each territory. The power was calculated by the number of adjacent allied territories, the proximity to a city, and the presence of a weapon or a horse. In the standard mode, the battles were always won by the territory with the higher power number. It was also possible to play in a Random mode that allowed for the random chance of a weaker number winning.The game also included multiple maps and a map editor.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>A single classical-style pinball table is provided in this simulation. A table editor is also provided - this allows you to choose a shape for the table and arrange the component parts as you wish. Up to four players can take it in turns, each with five balls in turn. [CR]Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers at the bottom of the table, as well as some located higher up. Use them to return a ball higher on table and to prevent it being lost at the bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable areas of table gives you a bonus. Gain as many points as possible to rack up a high score.</plot>

All cars are equipped with weapons which can be used to destroy the opposition. Other things to keep in mind are holes on the track which need to be jumped over and power ups which offer advantages when picked up, e.g. more speed. Permission to start at the next race is only given if the player finishes the race among the first three. Between races the car and its weapon system can be upgraded.</plot>

			<plot>Midi-Maze, played on Atari STs linked up via MIDI cables, is probably the first multiplayer first-person shooter for home micros, and a descendent of the original Maze War from the 70s.[CR]Naturally, this game is quite dissimilar to the FPS games of today. The game is set in a typical maze with only 90 corners instead of the multi-level free layouts of a modern FPS, and all graphics are drawn with filled polygons only. Weapon systems are limited to a plain gun with a small reloading interval. And all the participants are big, floating smiling faces. Up to 16 players may compete simultaneously, but those who wish to train before a match can do it alone against drones. It is possible both to play one against all or to team up.</plot>

You play Aaron Boone, the main character from both the book and the movie. Boone is attempting to get to a planet of bliss called Midian. His attempts at gaining acceptable go wrong when he is bitten by a cannibal, and the Police of Earth find Midian and set out to destroy it. Boone must stop them.The game has several different sequences, most arcade based, trying to bring sequences from the movie to life on the computer screen. There are eight action types from driving to Midian, running from Peloquin the cannibal, or fighting 'The Mask', a serial killer whom Boone is mistaken for.</plot>

			<title_clean>Operation Thunderbolt</title_clean>
			<plot>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.[CR]There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.[CR]You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.[CR]There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</plot>

			<plot>Overlander sees Elite attempt a Roadblasters style driving game with shooting overtones, with the action viewed from behind your armour-plated well-armed car. It all takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe in which a lot of money can be earned by transporting goods form place to place, but the large gangs of Overlanders who already do this are keen to stop you.[CR]Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher but more lucrative than the other, with half the money paid upfront and the other half on successful completion. Before setting off, you can buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan. Attacks from other vehicles can come either from guns or attempting ramming, and the roads are poorly-maintained and hazardous, so be careful, or better yet be violent first.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-Land was created by Namco and released into arcades in 1984. It was also ported to many consoles and in 1996 was included in Namco Museum Vol 4 for the PlayStation. The arcade game used the Namco Pac-Land system board, which was also used in Dragon Buster, Metro-Cross, Baraduke and Sky Kid. Pac-Land also featured parallax scrolling for some of its backgrounds, which was not commonplace until the 16-bit era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game centers around getting a fairy to the end of the stage and eventually back to the Queen Fairy in Fairyland. Since there were the five ghosts (Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue) that kept chasing Pac-Man, the fairy was tucked away safely under the hat that Pac-Man was wearing. Together they venture right and left, completing levels and avoiding dangerous obstacles like quicksand, water and the ghosts themselves.For bonus points, the player can collect cherries and other items. Also, there is an power pellet on each stage that Pac-Man can collect. That turns the ghosts blue. Then the ghost consuming can begin...When the player has made it to the end of the final stage, they are awarded with a pair of magical boots. Those are helpful, as they allow continuous jumps in the air as Pac-Man returns home. Once he is home, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. If playing the US release, Pac-Man is also greeted by Sourpuss and Chomp-Chomp (from the Pac-Man cartoon).Then, if the player chooses, Pac-Man starts another journey with the same objective but with increased difficulty.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Unlike regular Pac-Man, which is two dimensional, Pac-Mania has an isometric perspective, with the maze being larger than what is shown at any given time. The core game play is similar to original Pac-Man, with the goal being to eat dots, and eat ghosts after eating the power pellets. However, the main distinguishing feature is that in Pac-Mania, Pac-Man can jump to avoid ghosts. However, as the game progresses, the ghosts also attain the ability to jump, thus making them that much more dangerous.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. [CR]Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). [CR]A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.[CR]Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.[CR]You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.[CR]After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.</plot>

			<plot>Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.[CR]The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.</plot>

To help you in this, Panther can use various items, such as a little bell, which he can use to attract the sleeping man.The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther can himself move freely in the house, but at the same time he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables.Before each level you can purchase different kind of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man in the right path. </plot>

			<plot>Plutos is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up featuring a succession of waves, containing what's reputed to be the first simultaneous 2-player mode on the ST or Amiga. Many of the enemies you face are waves of laser fodder with movement patterns taking them around the screen, with gun turrets and firing enemies as well, to fight or avoid. You start with 4 lives, and get an extra one (and a 5000 point bonus) after every level.[CR]In many similar shoot 'em ups, you have unlimited fuel but must pick up ammunition recharges or increased powerups. Plutos lacks weapon upgrades, but rather inventively forces you to refuel, by shooting at posts which contain fuel (there are also bays for 500 bonus points marked out). Each level finishes with an enemy with eyes shooting at you, and from level 3 there are teeth mounted in front which fire at you.</plot>

			<plot>Psion Chess is programmed by Richard Lang, a computer chess champion in the 80s and programmer of some of the most advanced dedicated chess computers of the epoque. The Atari ST version of Psion Chess is said to be a mildly modified version of his "Amsterdam program" which won the 1985 world computer chess championships.[CR]Gamewise, Psion Chess has both 2D and fixed-perspective 3D views of the board, visible both from the black and white sides, a full range of handicaps, move suggestions, solutions for mate problems up to 10 levels, remi offers and most other options a demanding chess player can ask for. A library of 50 master parties is also available for viewing.[CR]The Atari ST version has a ranking of 1960, whereas the Mac version has been rated at 1793 over 80 parties.</plot>

			<plot>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.[CR]There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)[CR]The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</plot>

			<plot>Quadralien is a real-time puzzle game in the tradition of Sokoban.[CR]The future: Mankind's space stations throughout the solar system are powered by a huge space reactor, called Astra. Astra is about to break down. The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core.[CR]You're controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You've got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You've got to consider chain reactions. [CR]Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own.  You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there's a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!</plot>

			<plot>Quink is a puzzle game for one or two players. In each round of the game, eight names, places, or objects will appear on the screen that will be associated in some way. Out of the eight items, two to six will not be related to the others. The player needs to identify which item(s) are loners and remove them from the list in the given time limit. For each wrong guess the player will lose a life; if three lives are lost, the game ends. Points are awarded for correctly identifying loners; each round contains a goal score, so even if the player completes a round without losing all three lives the goal still needs to be met to proceed onto the next round. In addition to the regular gameplay rounds, there are also two types of challenge rounds: the single loner challenge, and the matchmaker challenge. In the single loner challenge there will be only one loner in the set; the goal is to identify it as quickly as possible. A correct choice earns bonus points, or the round ends when an incorrect selection is made or time runs out. In the matchmaker challenge, there are nine items displayed; the player needs to find out which item matches the one displayed in the center of the board. Correct choices earn bonus points.Quink includes several subject areas, each of which have numerous categories that items may be associated by. The categories are:Fame - includes categories such as Real Names of Movie Stars, Famous Generals, Leaders of Nations, TV Sportscasters, Sci-Fi Writers, and more.Pop Culture - includes Dances, Monopoly Avenues, Toys, Mixed Drinks, TV Westerns, Airlines, and more.Imagination - includes Music Terms, Onomatopoeia, Operas, Theft Talk, Poetic License, Bookish Things, Cartoon Curses, and more.Science and Nature - includes Computer Lingo, Diseases, Vegetables, Knots, Birds, Metals, Parts of a Cell, and more.General Knowledge - Seas, Cheeses, Martial Arts Forms, National Parks, Longest Rivers, Ancient Greeks, and more.Mixed Bag - All of the above subject areas are included at the same time.The game includes several gameplay options which adjust the difficulty and time limits. There is also an advanced play mode; in this mode the player must indicate when all loners have been removed instead of the game indicating such automatically. </plot>

			<title_clean>Return to Genesis</title_clean>
			<plot>The main goal of Return to Genesis is to rescue various scientists from a space colony overrun by vicious alien invaders. There are twelve scientists total, though they have all been cloned fifty times each to increase the colony's overall productivity, so the player will encounter many instances of the same scientist. These scientists will be able to upgrade your craft between missions, the actual upgrades being dependent on who was rescued. The game plays a lot like Defender, in that the player is put into a panoramic stage where they can choose to go either left or right and quickly switch directions if necessary. They must rescue the various scientists strewn about the level (not always on the ground) and avoiding or destroying the pursuing aliens before moving onto the next stage.  The game was designed to push the boundaries of what Amiga and Atari ST could do, regarding the type of high-speed parallax scrolling-based shoot 'em ups popular in the arcades at the time. As such, it perhaps moves a little too fast for some players.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Road Blasters</title_clean>
			<plot>Roadblasters is a 1987 rally-racing shooter by Atari. Players must collect enough fuel to make it through 50 levels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls an armed vehicle through 50 "worlds" (tracks). A number of enemies including vehicles, obstacles, and road-side cannons impede progress, but the player may "die" an unlimited number of times. Progression is dependent upon acquiring "fuel globes"; when the player is out of gas, gameplay ends.Checkpoints, killing enemies, and progressing through worlds provide additional fuel. Moreover, in some versions (the original Arcade, and certain ports/remakes) allow the player to begin on a higher level with higher fuel and score multipliers.Occasionally, a special weapon, such as a cruise missile launcher, are dropped from a friendly aircraft. If the player catches the special weapon, a limited number of uses are available. The arcade cabinet features stereo sound, and digitized voice. Both upright and sit-down cabinets were made.[CR]Cultural Impact[CR]The original release of RoadBlasters included a Match Box toys tie-in. Additionally, a player getting to the end of the game (including when continuing using additional quarters) would be given a "secret code" which could be sent to Atari for a free T-Shirt. This promotion ended in 1987.[CR]</plot>

The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points.

			<plot>In Road Wars you are set charging up a long hilly road, trying to make a road safe after a protection malfunction. Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.</plot>

Never mind -- let's just help him out, okay?[CR]You control the friendly, spotted ball with the cursor keys. It'll gain speed as it goes, bounce off when it hits obstacles, loose energy when it's caught in traps, die when it falls off the platform. The 32 levels through which you've got to guide the ball are full of traps: laser barriers, ramps, tubes, breakable tiles etc. Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or destroy!) helpful items. These include picks to repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from falling off and bombs to destroy walls. Items have to be bought with coins that are found all over the level. [CR]The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel to it, making the control intuitive and relatively easy. Not so easy, however, is the design of the (huge) levels; to finish Rock 'n Roll, you need skill as well as patience. You got the balls?</plot>

The player has until December to achieve their ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of the band's releases.Once the player's band has recorded their first album the player can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director is chosen to direct it. The player can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of the rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend the gigs. The player loses the game if either they run out of money or all of their rock stars die.</plot>

			<plot>You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.[CR]Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.[CR]As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.[CR]The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.</plot>

			<plot>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.[CR]You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. [CR]The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups</plot>

			<plot>The sequel to 1989's Shadow of the Beast, Shadow of the Beast II is a side-scrolling action game developed by Reflections Interactive and published by Psygnosis in 1990. Although side-scrolling platformers were nothing new at this point, the game was considered revolutionary for its high production values, featuring lush graphics consisting of high-quality backdrops and animations never before seen in videogames, and a stunning, atmospheric soundtrack composed by David Whittaker and Tim Wright. game over sequenceIn particular, the music for SOTB II's game over sequence was of such notable quality that some fans were known to die in-game for the sole purpose of hearing the backing track again. The game, much like its predecessor, is notoriously difficult, and has faced some criticisms of favoring style over substance.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Shadowgate</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The entrance to Castle Shadowgate in the NES version.Shadowgate is a 1987 point-and-click adventure game originally released for the Mac by ICOM Simulations and is part of the MacVenture series. It has been ported to a variety of platforms including the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. The player takes control of a relatively faceless character who must traverse through the castle avoiding many obstacles and choosing the right course of action to proceed. The game is extremely linear and usually there is only one correct solution to every puzzle with all other solutions leading to the player's demise or an equally dire consequence. The player is required to carry a flaming torch at all times to illuminate the path ahead. If the torch dies, the player must light another as soon as possible or an unfortunate end will be met. The torches also act as a time-limiter, with only a certain number of torches in the game the player must reach the conclusion before all the torches have expired.A lot of items in the game can be used in many ways, for example, it is possible to go through the item menu screen and tell the game to use the flaming torch on the player, where upon the game will inform the player that they have received a nasty burn, and eventually burn themselves to death if repeated. The player could even thrust an arrow into his chest and commit suicide in that manner.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is a faceless character who is only described in the game as the "last of a great line of hero-kings". He must attempt to stop the Warlock Lord from releasing the Behemoth from Hell.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the many death messages in the game.The game is a "point-and-click" adventure title that revolves around the player looking at a usually static background and scanning it for clues, possible threats and the path ahead. The player can interact with many items of interest in a lot of scenes, attempting different things, and the game relaying the outcome through its frank and often hilarious text window. The player can pick up a good deal of items on their travels, many of which will be imperative if they are to succeed in their goals. The game features many memorable foes, such as the Wraith the player encounters early in the game and the fire-breathing Dragon later down the line.Death is a very, very common thing in Shadowgate. If the player died at a point they can retrace their steps and attempt to solve the puzzle differently, and if they succeed they can proceed, but would only progress so far before being smote again and retracing their steps once more. The game is as much about thinking intelligently about solutions as it is just running in and trying everything one at a time until the correct method is used. There are a few instances where there are multiple solutions to a given problem, but these are few and far between.Shadowgate has many items that are used to solve puzzles in the game. Some of the items that appear to be normal are used in ways most people would never think of. Such as the war hammer that the player can't actually use to attack any enemies but is used to open secret portals. Some items, like the helmet or human bone, can be picked up but have no use whatsoever in the game except to clutter the inventory. Most items only have one use and are never used again. There are only a few items that can be used more than once, but even then the most they are used is twice. There are around 40 items in the game that all need to be used to solve a specific puzzle. Usually there is no hints when to use an item, which leads to a lot of guessing and trial and error to discover when each item needs to be used.[CR]Remake[CR]Initially intended to be a 25th anniversary celebration, a remake was confirmed to be in production for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android for release in 2013. Footage, art direction, and remixed music have been shown off at the game's Kickstarter. Some puzzles are new or reworked, and all of the components, including graphics and script, are being completely overhauled. The game's music is based on the much-acclaimed NES version's soundtrack. Zojoi, the company behind this new version, is made up of designers that worked on the original MacVentures version.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Silent Service is an NES game in which the player controls a submarine and patrols and engages in skirmishes with other submarines. Its is more like a submarine sim then a traditional arcade game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Silent Service is set in the Pacific Ocean during World War Two. The player assumes control of a U.S. Submarine, the U.S.S. Raven, which is assigned missions to carry out. This side of the war is rarely told in games. There are two types of game modes to play; Convoy Actions and War Patrol. Convoy Actions are specific scenarios in which the player is given a specific objective to complete. In War Patrol mode players are given the ability to roam anywhere in the Pacific  for 30 days looking for Japanese ships to attack. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is basically a submarine simulation game. It uses realistic tactics such as the End Around, as well as having the ability to adjust visibility and dud torpedoes. The game also gives you control of the rudders, periscope, and ballast, as well as displaying the speed, depth, and heading of your sub. You are placed in the waters of Japan and you are required to ping ships with your sonar in order to detect enemies. This game has a relatively steep learning curve to it.[CR]</plot>

Skyfox is complete with deflection shields, laser cannons, five guided and five heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach IV.  The 15 scenarios can be played at 5 skill levels. You will have to fight tanks, enemy planes and the mothership.  Use the radar to locate enemy vehicles, and the long-range scanner to ensure that no wave reaches your base before you can take it out. Keep an eye on your shields, and on fuel levels - you can dock at the base to refuel.</plot>

			<plot>As the ruthless Slayer you have hordes of enemies to wipe out in this horizontally-scrolling shooter. The paths are narrow and treacherous in a similar way to Scramble, so shooting out the wall-mounted installations is important. There are plenty of bonus weapons and shields available however, and 5 lives in total. Each of the 3 levels ends with a boss to defeat.</plot>

			<plot>[CR]Plot [CR]The president has been attacked by terrorists, and they have threatened Washington D.C. with a nuclear attack. Sly Spy enters the city by jumping from a plane and infiltrating the city from above. The terrorist cannot be allowed to progress their plan of attack, and Sly Spy is the only one that can stop it.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Sly Spy covers a varying amount of game genres, but it all takes place as a side scrolling adventure. The genres include action, run and gun, beat'em up and adventure, and each level is broken up into these genres. You begin the game by choosing your secret agent number (i.e. 007), and sky dive from a plane shooting enemies all the way down. After this, the game primarily becomes run and gun style game if you are in possession of a weapon, or a beat'em with out the weapon. The gameplay changes occasionally in the game, sometimes you may be riding a motorcycle or even swimming under water. In these instances the game style retains the objective of simply shooting the enemies on screen. You will progress through the game eliminating multiple bosses, culminating to a level where you have fight all the bosses once again including the final boss.   James Bond references are plentiful in this game ranging from bosses to weapons. Some bosses bare similarities to Bond villains, such as Jaws and Odd Job. Sly Spy's weapon of choice is an actual Golden Gun and is referred to as such. It is never kept secret that Data East is imitating the James Bond franchise.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Soccer Manager Plus</title_clean>
			<plot>Soccer Manager Plus is a managerial soccer simulation. The player takes control over a team from the second division and is responsible for its financial and athletic success. In the original German version the game used real athlete and club names, but the athletes are randomly divided between the clubs.In various menus, the player can set ticket prices, visit a training camp or take action on the transfer market. Before the match, the athletes are divided into the team. Here the player should note each athlethe's statistics (goal, defense, offense, mid field and energy) which determine his performance depending on where he is used. The last setting to take is toughness: the higher the setting, the higher the chances of success. The downside is a higher risk of injuries and cards.The main part of the game is completely menu based, but the player may choose to watch match highlights, only the goals or directly the result. The match segments are shown in a side-scrolling perspective.</plot>

			<title_clean>Space Ace</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace is Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous branching pathways. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a "miss" into its narrative and continue on.Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the "collection of disjointed scenes" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the "Infanto Ray", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a "Shoot" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to "Energize". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES versionThe SNES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace "Dexter", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. [CR]Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.[CR]The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.[CR]Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</plot>

			<plot>(From Infocom Home Page site)[CR]After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...</plot>

			<title_clean>Stunt Car Racer</title_clean>
			<plot>Stunt Car Racer differentiates itself from other racing games by having races that take place on an elevated race track with nothing to prevent the player from accidentally driving of either side of the track. Most of the race tracks in the game gave large gaps in them to give more challenge to the races, often causing serious problems to the driver if he or she fails to clear them. If the player doesn't make it across these gaps or falls of the elevated race tracks, the player's vehicle is hoisted back onto the track by a nearby crane, costing valuable time to the player. There is a feature that allows you to go faster called Turbo, but can only be used in a limited amount of time in each race.  Damage occurs to the player's car when the player lands too hard on the track. when the player accidentally drives off the track, crashes into a wall, hits an opponent's car or falls into one of the gaps in the track.  The amount of damage done to the car is indicated by a crack in the frame of the car at the top of the screen. When the circles and crack reach a certain point, the vehicle is completely destroyed and the player will instantly lose the race. A hard crash will make structural damage appear in the frame above the windshield. Holes will remain on the car for the rest of the season, and increase at a rate at which the crack in the frame advances.The single player portion of the game has a league table split into four divisions of three drivers each, making a total of twelve racers, including the human player. There are two tracks in each division, making a total of eight tracks in the game. Each division gets progressively harder as the game goes on.   On the Atari ST and Amiga versions of the game, the player can compete with another live player via connecting two of the same computers up with a null modem cable, each with their own TV or Monitor. The game had received many positive reviews when it was released. These reviews described the 3D tracks as resembling a kind of roller coaster, which was something new for players, and is ofter described as an especially fun racing game, with a special kind of track design.

			<plot>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. [CR]With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</plot>

			<plot>An updated 16-bit version of Codemasters' Grand Prix Simulator. As before, the basic gameplay resembles Super Sprint, with an overhead view of simple tracks incorporating hairpins, oil slicks and underpasses.[CR]The game now features 4 modes of play - Formula 1 cars, motorbikes, drag racers, and a mode featuring a variety of vehicles. These include those 3 as well as police cars, go-karts and a tank, which is too slow to be competitive but allows you to shoot out the other cars, and can be a blockade as you try to lap it.[CR]Up to 6 cars can be featured in each race, and you can race over 3,4 or 5 laps. Four human players are supported, 2 on joysticks and 2 on keyboard</plot>

			<plot>Tanglewood is set on the planet T'ng-y-wd where Uncle Arthur has set up his mining operations. But just as he gets successful, a company tries to sue him out - the court date is in ten days and he has to prove his ownership of the planet. Now the player has to go there to find the needed documents.The goal of the game is to use five mobiles to find items and use them in the right spot. This is made more difficult by the time limit (indicated with the day-night rhythm) and the big free-roaming world. Every mobile has different abilities, e.g. repairing, and attributes which allow them to travel through places the others can't pass. The action comes into play because the player directly controls the mobiles and has to evade the defenses built up by the company. Initially only one mobile can protect itself; the other ones have to find certain crystals and learn how to use them.The player can instantly switch between the mobiles. This is not only needed to solve puzzles, but also because all mobiles (including the opponent's) run out of energy when used. The only way to recharge is to spend time with another mobile - but the time does not stop for the unused mobiles, so it is advised to park them at a save location. Some parts of the game take place underground, e.g. in mines.</plot>

			<title_clean>Their Finest Hour - The Battle of Britain</title_clean>
			<plot>A flight simulator that takes place during WWII. It captures the real dag-a-dag flavour of WWII dogfighting! Be a pilot of authentic airplane or take up the role as a gunner.Their Finest Hour : Battle of Britain was developed by Lawrence Holland for LucasArts in 1989.   George Lucas had been a fan of World War 2 movies since childhood, and the famous dogfight   scenes in Star Wars were directly inspired by these films... even down to the gun turret in the   Millenium Falcon... based on the B-17 Flying Fortress.  Based on the Battle of Britain during 1940, it gives you the chance to fly as a pilot of the RAF   defending England or in the Luftwaffe as part of the preparations for invading England.  The action is really intens. Chunks of aircraft fall off as you hit them, you can see the flashes of strikes on the fuselages   and wings - aircrew will jump for their lives using their parachutes while others aren't so lucky as their aircraft exploded in a ball of flame around them, while others   suffer a slower longer fate as the aircraft spun down out of control in flames. The game also allows you to create several personalities and have them fly with you on   combat missions. The best way to do this was go through all the single missions to give the   pilot/crew combat experience flying them yourself, then let them fly in your squadron during   a campaign - and if luck was with them, they will score kills, get promotions and medals.   You also have the ability to save your kills on a gun camera, and the game also includes a   mission builder, which is simple to use, but the missions you can create are far beyond   anything you may get in the game generated campaign.  You can never be killed by enemy fire in this sim, even if your aircraft were being blown to   pieces - the only way for you to die is to physically crash into the ground or sea. Also,   your parachute is fail safe and always opens, no matter how high or low you are!    Another funny thing, when your aircraft goes out of control through too much battle damage,   you will always spin to the right. You can do belly landings, both on land and sea, which is useful. The combat damage to your aircraft is inflicted on either the airframe or the   engine(s). The engines are very slow in throttle response - they measured from 0 to 100   percent power, and you have to tap the key for each percent you want to go up or down,   there is no snap commands to full or idle power!     "    The aircraft available are :  Spitfire MkI Spitfire MkII Hurricane Mk1 Me-109E-4 Me-109E-4B Me-110C-4 Me-110C-4B Ju-87B-1 Ju-87B-2 He-111 Ju-88A1 Do-17Z. [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Thunder Jaws</title_clean>
			<plot>ThunderJaws is an action, side-scrolling platformer.In a secret underwater base, the evil Madame Q is determined to control the world. To that end she has kidnapped thousands of beautiful girls to use in her diabolical experiments. Players are part of a team of experts hired by the government to find and penetrate Madame Q's fortress and free the hostages. After the submarine reaches its destination, players scuba dive to get to the base and must avoid mines and chemical spills as well as battle sharks and enemy divers with their spear-shooting harpoons.The inside of the fortress is very similar to the territory in Rolling Thunder, and because of this ThunderJaws is considered by many as the unofficial sequel to that game. Levels get progressively harder, more elaborate and contain more enemies as the game progresses. Additional weapons are obtained when dropped by fallen enemies.The game can be played by single players or in 2-player mode.</plot>

			<title_clean>Time Bandit</title_clean>
			<plot>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.[CR]Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.[CR]Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).[CR]Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. [CR]Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</plot>

			<plot>In Time Machine, the player takes control over Professor Potts whose main profession is building time machines. As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each.This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.The professor has a limited amount of mini time machines in his pocket which can be placed on a screen for travelling purposes. However, the usage of them is not limited. The action elements of the game consist of enemies which try to hurt the professor. Those can be disposed of  by firing an (automatically recharging) electrical discharge. While those action elements are always present, the focus lies on the puzzle solving.</plot>

			<title_clean>Total Eclipse</title_clean>
			<plot>Total Eclipse was released on all major 8-bit and 16-bit platforms in 1988. It was the third game to use Freescape - for its time, a radical 3D engine which allowed players to navigate their way through a variety of 3D environments. Although sluggish, it was still a stellar leap from what 8-bit gamers were used to at the time. The Freescape engine was developed in-house by Incentive Software - the development house behind the game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game took place in the 1930's, and put you in the role of an adventurer who had just landed his bi-plane outside an ominous pyramid deep in the Sahara desert. It was also hard not to notice the sun was slowly being covered by the moon - the beginning of a total eclipse. The Egyptian Sun God known as High Priest Re had placed a curse on the moon - it was up to you to navigate through the pyramid's labyrinth of rooms and corridors and stop the curse by destroying Re's shrine before the moon completely covers the sun and explodes into shards of polygonal fragments.[CR]Game Mechanics[CR]Passage of time throughout the game is represented by a wrist watch on the game's HUD - rather radically for the time, the game's two hour time limit was in real-time. As you negotiated the pyramid, traps, mummies or high falls would cause the player's heart rate to rocket. Time played a vital role in that it could be "spent" reducing the player's heart rate by resting. As well as keeping an eye on heart rate, players also had to keep an eye on their ever-dwindling water supply - which could be replenished by interacting with wells, troughs and other water-carrying vessels. The player also had a pistol to defend himself against any enemies as well as activating switches. Keys were also represented by the Egyptian symbol of the Ankh - the player could obtain these Ankhs by shooting them. These Ankhs were vital to unblock barriers and get to other areas of the pyramid.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. [CR]You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. [CR]The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.[CR]Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</plot>

			<title_clean>Tracksuit Manager</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tracksuit Manager, originally released in 1988 on a multitude of platforms, allowed players to take control of their favourite nation and hopefully take them on to win the European Championships and finally the World Cup. One of Tracksuits Managers' strong selling points was that for its time, it had an extremely detailed tactics system, allowing the user to go as far as giving a limited number of individual instructions to players.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Due to the game being set within International competition the game had no transfer system but instead started with a pool of 100 players to choose from for your chosen country. Unfortunately players choosing any country other than England were forced to enter in player details individually before they could proceed. From here players would choose a squad of 22 from which they would then choose their starting 11 and substitutions from. To help with selecting players a scout report could be supplied for each individual player giving the strength of a players passing or shooting, as well as their confidence level and stamina. Once a squad had been assembled the next step was to sort out tactics for the team. As noted earlier the level of tactical variety was detailed for its time allowing players to choose between different formations, attack-defence balance, attacking and defensive styles as well as what range of passing was preferred and how hard to tackle to opposition. These options could then also be configured for individual players, allowing you to play to certain players individual strength, for example if you had a midfielder with excellent passing, but the rest of your team was average at passing, you could set the team to play short passes whilst allowing your midfielder who was excellent at passing to hit long passes, reducing the chance of giving the ball away and also creating more opportunities.Players were also able to arrange one off friendly matches or friendly tours giving you the opportunity to fine tune your playing squad and tactics.MatchdayThe match screen was again fairly detailed for its time of release. At the bottom of the screen it gave the player a small pitch indicating the current position of the ball, whilst the top half was a text box containing a description of the match action. To indicate who was in possession of the ball the team name would be highlighted. The description of the action gave the player a rough idea what was happening although obviously this was fairly limited to a few set phrases. Whenever a shot was attempted the text was highlighted  and there was a slight delay in giving the player the outcome of the shot, thus giving(or trying to give!) a feeling of suspense.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Treasure Island Dizzy</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Treasure Island Dizzy - ZX Spectum version.Treasure island dizzy is the heart warming tale of a egg gone awry. Dizzy embarks on a around the world cruise expecting the holiday of a lifetime. The YolkFolk had warned him prior to his cruise that the deal he had got must be too good to be true and in the end the YolkFolk were proved to be eggcelent in their deductions. Upon disembarking for his trip of a lifetime Dizzy noticed something was not quite right with his ship. The captain was called long john silver and there appeared to be alot of drunk pirates aboard. Dizzy in all of his wonder had managed to book a cruise on a pirate ship.As time passed Dizzy learnt to enjoy the company of the pirates and started to fit in. So much so that one sunny day while the ship was stuck in shallow waters dizzy organised a game of cricket on the deck. This went down a storm with the pirates and fun was had by all. This was until they realised that Dizzy had used Long John Silvers spare wooden peg leg collection as wickets and they had now been thrown overboard in the excitement of the match.In the end the inevitable happened when you go on a cruise with pirates and Dizzy was forced to walk the plank. He later washed up on a sunkissed beach with only one thing on his mind. Revenge? no. He had to get back to the YolkFolk and lodge his compensation claim, and he had to do it now!This is where the adventure of Treasure island Dizzy begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]TID was at its heart a puzzle/adventure game. It had advancements over its predecessor such as a fully implemented inventory system and improved animations. The addition of the inventory led to a new style of gameplay for the Dizzy series. Gameplay focused less on defeating enemies and more on solving puzzles with inventory items. Dizzy's main aim in the game was to construct a boat so he could sail home.TID is without doubt one of the most difficult Dizzy games as the game featured no health bar and you only had one life. Another feature that made the game hideously difficult was that the inventory management could be described as "insane"  the only interaction you had with your inventory was pressing enter which made dizzy put down an item in the inventory. Which item however was out of your control as dizzy always just put down the item at the top of the list. This meant that you could be swimming underwater and tap enter dizzy would put down his snorkel  item and instantly drown to death. It could be argued Dizzy was not the brightest. This forced the player to think ahead massively when it came to having to use items in the inventory.Other issues which made the game difficult was that the game featured a side quest that had to be completed to leave the island. This side quest was only explained to the player however just as they were about to leave the island and, as far as the player was concerned, finish the game. This side quest involved going back through the island and collecting 30 coins which where hidden behind scenery.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>1829: The Esmerelda, a cargo ship carrying gold, sinks to the bottom of the ocean.[CR]1927: A treasure hunter called Howard Kelp dons a diving suit and searches for the bullion in the wreck.[CR]Treasure Trap is an isometric action adventure similar to Head Over Heels, but less abstract in its theme. The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited amount of "smart fishes", trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the enemies in the room. Since the player starts with 2 fishes and only receives a new one at each 80 gold bars collected, most of the time the enemies have to be avoided by staying away or jumping over them. Stacking boxes and other objects stops the fauna from getting to the character (and also allows access to high places). There's an air gauge that is constantly depleting at the bottom-right of the screen. It can be filled with the compressed air tanks scattered in some rooms. Some doors require geometric-shaped keys. These can be collected and stored in three slots at the bottom-left of the screen. The game allows saving at each 50 gold collected.</plot>

			<plot>Typhoon Thompson was an unusual game where you had to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts.[CR]The plot was that the "Sea Child" was stolen and Typhoon Thompson sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).[CR]The game never played like a "shoot-'em-up" - too much persistant firing was never much use - and required more tactics.</plot>

			<plot>Vulcan is a third entry in R. T. Smith's World War II trilogy, including Arnhem and Desert Rats. It simulates the Tunisian Campaign in 1942-43 from the arrival of the 'Torch' Task Force and their race for Tunis, to the final battle of 'Operation Vulcan'. There are 5 armies (3 Allied &amp; 2 Axis) and 5 scenarios, including the battles of Kasserine and Mareth. Each scenario has several pre-conditions to start from, which include Axis control Malta, Axis capture Bone, DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps) destroyed, Desert armies late, and French neutrality.The gameplay is flown on scrolling map by turns. Player selects the units and gives them orders. Units move on the grid of rectangular cells. Landscape objects influence on the movement. For example, mountainous terrain allows hidden movement, or river blocks the way. Air attack phase is possible between turns.The game comes with detailed instruction booklet and includes historical notes on the campaign, maps and photographs. Two players representing Allied and Axis may be computer or human.</plot>

			<plot>Ocean's second wrestling game is tag-team-based, taking the player through four fights around major European cities. The player assembles a two-man team from Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Bret 'Hitman' Hart and Macho Man Randy Savage.Combat takes place both in and out of the ring, although a wrestler can't spend more than ten seconds at a time outside the ring. Once opponents are stunned, it becomes possible to throw them, which inflicts real damage to their energy bar. Many combination moves are available, including jumping off the ropes and landing on an opponent to pin him.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the year 2045 insect-like aliens from Sirius attacked Earth. Three billion humans died in the attack, and in the following years more than a third of the Earth's population died as a direct consequence of the conflict during a planet-wide nuclear winter.No one knows why they attacked, it is only speculated that they may have wanted to reduce Earth back to the state of barbarism. It is speculated that the insects, or "Roaches" as they are called, may share a common ancestor with Earth's insects. They are a group-mind and have shared consciousness, tens are required for any real intelligence, some even argue that they are more like one entity than numerous individuals.Since the attack all the Earth's old national borders and divisions were abolished and Fist-Of-Earth organization formed an efficient wartime world government to handle rebuilding and defending the planet from further attacks. It is feared that the Sirians may come back. The base of operations is a Space station orbiting the Sun, Solbase.It is 2057 and Earth has a new hope, the first workable interstellar fighter, FOE-57. Project Warhead enlists new pilots.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>While flying three members of the same family, your planes crash-lands in an area where it soon becomes clear that time has stood still - dinosaurs still roam the area, and the humans are primitive and carnivorous. Your task is to guide them to safety through the complex isometrically viewed world (using the same basic game engine as Denton Designs' Great Escape license).[CR]Hazards to be faced include the aforementioned dinosaurs and cavemen, as well as sea monsters, precarious mountainous ledges and dilapidated bridges. Objects including weapons and first aid kits can be collected. Each character has his own distinct behaviors - one becomes hungry easily, while another is only really competent while his fianc survives. Although the ultimate aim is to save all four characters, you can continue while at least one is alive.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Willow was developed by       Mindscape (computer versions) and      Capcom (Arcade and NES versions). The home computer, Arcade, and NES versions are all quite different from each other. All three are based on the movie from 1988 of the same name.[CR]Computer Versions[CR]The home computer version of the game (Atari ST, Amiga, and PC) were the  first versions released. This game is split into five different gameplay  sections.The first section is a first person perspective maze.  First Person Maze The second section is another one from a first person perspective, this time around the player is sliding down an ice tunnel and must choose various paths along the way. First Person Ice Tunnel The third section is a top down perspective one where the goal is to avoid oncoming enemy attacks.  Top Down Stage The fourth section is a side scrolling scene where the goal is to reach  the end while avoiding oncoming attacks and defeating the enemies. Side Scrolling Stage The fifth and final stage is one where a spell must be cast on a rat using the correct rune symbols. Spell Casting Stage [CR]NES Version[CR]The NES version of Willow plays much more like a traditional RPG. Willow for the NES deviates quite a bit from the movie, but still uses many of the same characters.

You can choose from three lengths of tour (home and abroad). These tours include one-day, three-day and a full blown test match. The game is a standard managerial game with icons on the menu screen to allow you to manage your team. When you play a match a scoreboard appears with the runs totting up. Occasionally the game will show a highlight of a decisive moment. This is a side view, first showing the bowler then the batsman. Here the ball can hit the wicket. If the batsman hits the ball then it either shows a catch or a six. During the game if you are batting you can choose the next batsman when a wicket has fallen or if you are bowling then when things need changing you can change bowler.</plot>

			<title_clean>Xevious</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Xevious is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up developed by Namco and released in the Arcade in 1982. It is one of the first games of its genre, and contributed many things to that genre, including the concept of bosses. The game is known for having one continuous level, featuring forests, bases, temples, and waterways. Xevious was a huge cult hit in Japan, despite its limited popularity in the United States. The game was also considered to be the first Arcade game to have a television commercial aired for it in the United States.The player controls a Solvalou, a combat aircraft containing both a front-firing "shooter" for anti-air combat and a "bomber" for air-to-ground bombing runs. The game contains both enemy aircraft and enemy ground units, such as tanks and turrets. It is one of the first shoot-em-ups to include hidden bonuses, which could be uncovered by bombing particular areas in the game (these include the SOL towers, which takes one bomb to reveal and one to destroy, and special flags). It is also one of the first shoot-em-ups to include a boss, the massive flying fortress Andor Genesis.The game was also known for its glitches and Easter eggs. It's possible to see a short message showing the programmer's name by moving to the bottom-right of the screen, holding down the bomb button and destroying the first two enemies. Another rare Arcade glitch gave the player countless amounts of lives.Xevious was ported to many systems, including the NES, Atari 8-bit, Atari 7800, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, FM-7, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Apple II, Amstrad CPC, Sharp X1, and the Sharp X68000. The original Arcade game has been in many of Namco's compilations, including Namco Museum Volume 2 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, Namco Museum Remix for the Wii, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3). The game was released as a Xbox Live Arcade game on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 400 MSP ($5), which was later included in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360. The game was also part of the Microsoft Revenge of Arcade compilation for the PC. The NES version of Xevious was also released for Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series.Xevious spawned a few obscure sequels. Super Xevious, released a year later on the arcades, was a harder version of the original with several new enemies. Solvalou, released in 1991 in Japan, is a version of Xevious shown from the first-person perspective. Xevious 3D/G, released in 1995 for arcades and the PlayStation, added 3D graphics while retaining the 2D viewpoint of the original. Xevious Arrangement was a special version of Xevious created for Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1. Xevious Resurrection is another special version of Xevious, but created for Namco Museum Essentials.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Yogi Bear has woken from his hibernation and is now searching his home, Jellystone Park for Picnic Baskets brought by tourists. On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog. You must complete each level in 2 minutes 40 seconds or it is game over. On the way there are obstacles like holes and water,  as well as other characters to get in your way. Touching these loses one of  three lives. Scattered over the levels are various food items which will give you 100 points as well as invisible ones giving 250 points. If you want a bigger score then on certain levels you can collect six items which reward you with 7500 points. Yogi's Great Escape is a platform game where you move Yogi from left to right with the screen scrolling when you move. </plot>
