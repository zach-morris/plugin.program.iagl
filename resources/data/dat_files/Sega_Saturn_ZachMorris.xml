		<title_clean>Alien Trilogy</title_clean>
		<plot>Alien Trilogy is a science fiction first person shooter loosely based on the first three Alien movies. It was released for PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996, and later ported to MS-DOS in 1997.The game only loosely follows the storyline of the Alien movies. The player undertakes the role of Ellen Ripley, the main character of the movies (portrayed by Sigourney Weaver) and apart from Bishop, there are no other major characters in the game. The storyline is advanced solely through the use of detailed text-based mission briefings at the start of each level and there are short cut scenes at the end of each game that provide a small amount of closure to the events of the preceding missions.There are three sets of levels. The first is on the Colony, anologous to Aliens, the second is on the Prison, anologous to Alien 3 (which isn't canonical since in the film, the prison had no weapons) and the third in on the Derelict spaceship, anologous to Alien though most of the level scenery is invented by the creators since so little of it is seen in the film.Gameplay wise, Alien Trilogy is best described as a straightforward shooter. There are objectives that must be addressed and Aliens must be eliminated. If the player gets less than 50% in "Mission" and/or "Aliens" meters, the mission must be repeated. Though it is similar to Doom, limited use of the Y-axis can be used to look up and down, whereas in Doom there was no Y-axis aiming. Weapons are the standard set seen in Aliens, with the addition of seismic charges (which were only mentioned in the film). There's a pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flamethrower and smartgun to fight the enemies with.Lamps like those of the marines' and the videogame-only night vision goggles can be obtained for enhanced sight in low light areas.Alien Trilogy has a variety of scenery, ranging from cargo holds, a cryogenic chamber, and the alien nest itself. Enemies look well enough at far, but up close they become severely pixilated, especially compared to the cleaner models of Alien vs Predator for the Atari Jaguar. Explosions are quite nice and a joy to look at, but nothing special is overall present by the graphic quality.Sound effects are mostly sampled from the movie, with the PC version having slightly altered sounds for the adult aliens and occasional lines delivered by Ripley in-game (not by Sigourney Weaver though). The soundtrack is a mix of electronic and classical instruments and sound effects like aliens hissing or thunder cracking, delivering an action oriented music sheet similar to that found on Probe's own Alien 3 for the Sega Genesis and Amiga.The game has some pretty brutal death scenes when the player loses their health. For example, Ripley's head is torn off by a xenomorph, and her face is mangled by a facehugger.Alien Trilogy was developed by Probe Entertainment for the console versions and Sculptured Software oversaw the DOS port which later followed.The game was published by Acclaim and Fox Interactive.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Amok</title_clean>
		<plot>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.[CR]Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.[CR]The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</plot>

The Andretti family involved themselves in the development of the game, Jeff Andretti specifically contributed to the design of the game.  Derek DalyCommentary In-game commentary was recorded by Derek Daly, Bob Jenkins and James Brown.  James Brown was the studio anchor for the game, giving updates between races as you progress through your career.

		<title_clean>Arcade Gears Vol. 2 - Gun Frontier</title_clean>
		<plot>Gun Frontier is a 1990 arcade vertical shoot-'em-up based on the animated series of the same name. The setting of the series and purportedly of the game is an extraterrestrial American Wild West, with the player fighting to defend settlers from airborne pirates -- the game, though, actually looks to be an entirely standard military-themed shooter, with the player's jet fighter set against tanks and other airplanes. Guns and bombs are levelled-up and collected by dropped power-ups, which are money-themed, with the gun upgrades shown as American dimes and bombs as gold bars.[CR]Gun Frontier was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and was later included in the cross-platform compilation Taito Legends 2 in 2006.</plot>

		<title_clean>Arcade Gears Vol. 3 - Wonder 3</title_clean>
		<plot>Wonder 3 is a faithful conversion of the 1991 arcade game. The original arcade game was designed to offer three different games in one cabinet, thus saving costly floor space in the video arcade. The three games are Midnight Wanderers (platform), Chariot (shooting) and Don't Pull (puzzle).[CR]Midnight Wanderers - quest for the chariot (aka Roosters)[CR]Midnight Wanderers is a run and gun game. You walk along a vertically scrolling platform while shooting enemies. You can grab power-ups such as stronger shot, or an option that follows you and shoots. The gameplay is very similar to Ghosts 'N Goblins (also by Capcom). If you get hit you even lose your clothes and walk in you underwear in the same way.[CR]Chariot - Adventure Through The Sky[CR]Chariot is a shoot'em-up similar to Gradius. You shoot enemies on a vertically scrolling screen, collect power-ups and fight end bosses. You collect power-ups such as three-way shot, stronger laser, extra points, options and a shield. If you pick up extra options, they attach to you like a tail. The end bosses are themed after the classic elements, like the wind and moon and sun etc.[CR]Don't Pull (donpuru)[CR]Don't Pull is essentially a polished and updated version of Pengo. In this single screen game, you play as a bunny or chipmunk walking through a maze full of baddies. You can push the blocks of the maze to crush the enemies.[CR]If you push a tile which is blocked by another tile, you will crush it to clear your way through the maze. There also are special blocks, for example if you push a block with a bomb icon, it explodes and stuns any nearby enemies. You get bonus points for crushing multiple enemies with a single block push.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Area 51 is an on-rails shooter that puts the player in the shoes of a member of the elite military group 'STAARS'. The player must use a light gun to kill all the aliens and zombies in the Area 51 facility without killing any other STAARS members. The arcade game's board was a souped-up Atari Jaguar.Area 51 was one of many arcade games that was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation consoles. Only the Saturn port was well received.A typical light gun game in most respects, Area 51 is notable for using digitized sprites over pre-rendered 3D environments, similar to other Midway games of the time like Mortal Kombat.The Area 51 license was resurrected in 2005, when Midway released a first-person shooter bearing the same name, which was loosely based on the events of the original game.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Atlantis - The Lost Tales</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Protagonist SethThe game as one might expect is set on a fantasy version of Earth where the city of Atlantis was not just a myth but the center of human civilization. From Atlantis humans have developed airships and gain the ability to wield magic. The protagonist and player character of Atlantis: The Lost Tales is named Seth who has recently become initiated into the ranks of the Queen of Atlantis&#8217;s personal bodyguards, a title called the Queen&#8217;s Companions. However immediately following Seth&#8217;s entrance into the Queen&#8217;s Companions the Queen of Atlantis mysteriously disappears. Taking upon himself to locate the missing queens Seth uncovers a conspiracy to dethrone the Queen of Atlantis.Seth discovers that the Guards of the Consul have become victorious in their insurrection of the Queen and are led by the head of the Guards Consul, Creon. Seth eventually uncovers Creon&#8217;s plan for world domination in the name of the Atlantian gods. However Creon not only wishes to displace the Queen of her throne but also aims to elevate the Atlantian god of the sun, Sa&#8217;at as the main deity of Atlantis thus supplanting the Atlantian goddess of the moon, Ammu the traditional main deity of Atlantis, of the position. Creon aims to conquer the entire planet in the name of Sa&#8217;at using an at first unidentified super weapon of awesome power.Atlantis Features Airship travel to Get Between LocationsAfter conducting research as to what Creon&#8217;s weapon may be Seth discovers that it is half of a powerful crystal which grants the holder of the crystal the power to emanate raw energy in blasts. Seth finds out the origin of the crystal in that it is the dark half of a split crystal with the dark half being hidden under Stonehenge while the light half was hidden on Easter Island. The crystals were hidden to prevent their use for evil and corruption of any uses who do not understand their power. Creon having located the dark half has been driven mad by its dark energy.After having traveled to Easter Island and locating the light crystal Seth confronts Creon and defeats him by combining the two crystals and using the whole crystal against Creon. Unfortunately the raw power of the crystal causes the plate tectonics of Atlantis to shift resulting in a volcano erupting from the ground. The volcano all but destroys Atlantis and only a few survivors, including Seth are able to get away from the disaster alive.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Atlantis: the Lost Tales is a Myst inspired adventure puzzle game. Like Myst the game is played in the first person and the player progress through the story by completing various environmental puzzles. The player navigates through panoramic screens by using the mouse to move the entire screen itself a opposed to moving the camera around. The game features a HUD-less interface and even lack a crossair to indicate where the game screen is centered at.As already mention the player progresses through the story by completing various environmental puzzles, some of which are timed and require the player to pick up on environmental ques. Most of the timed puzzles require the player to react correctly quickly or else the player character will die forcing the player to restart to their last save or checkpoint. Most puzzles however are abstract environmental patterns and contraptions, similar to Myst, that the player must correctly figure out how to use and decipher.One of the Many Rendered 3 D EnvironmentsGraphically Atlantis: The Lost Tales is rendered completely in 3D, excluding cut-scenes which are pre-rendered clips, using Cyro Entertainment&#8217;s proprietary technology. Cryo&#8217;s 3D rendering engine, OMNI 3D, provides Atlantis with its clean panoramic environments. All character animation however was done using motion capturing. The character animation utilizes Cryo&#8217;s audio and video synching technology called MNI Sync which provides seamless lip synching with voice acting in the game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The Soundtrack for Atlantis: The Lost Tales was composed collectively by Pierre Est&#232;ve and St&#233;phane Picq, with each working on separate tracks and occasionally working together on others.Disc 1Sunriders - 2:15Awakening - 6:44Rh&#233;a - 5:09Ancient Winds - 1:52Am Ma Eya - 2:30Pretress - 4:31Crystal Winds - 4:37Para Nua - 2:48Back To Atlantis - 4:41Spitzberg - 5:12Stonehenge - 2:35Dream Of The Owl - 6:55Dream Of The Dolphin - 5:03La Lune... - 11:16Disc 2Dark Spirits - 3:05La Tisseuse De Destins - 5:12Dream Of The Rat - 1:50Coq Rouge - 3:12Metamorphosis - 6:32Muria - 4:57Nightmare - 0:53Labyrinth - 5:26Aube - 4:01[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.[CR]Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).[CR]The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</plot>

		<plot>Toshinden Remix or Toshinden S as it was called in Japan is a port of Takara's Playstation fighting game Battle Arena Toshinden to the Sega Saturn by Sega.[CR]It adds an additional secret character as well as a story mode for each character. These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel Battle Arena Toshinden 2.[CR]The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.[CR]Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.[CR]Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.</plot>

		<plot>Battle Arena Toshinden Ultimate Revenge Attack is the second Toshinden game for the Saturn, following Battle Arena Toshinden Remix[CR]Whereas Remix was a tweaked version of the Playstations  Battle Arena Toshinden, Ulitmate Revenge Attack isn't a tweaked version of the Playstations  Battle Arena Toshinden 2 but rather a new game.[CR]It abandons the plot of the original Toshinden/Toshinden Remix and tells a new standalone tale revolving around the assassination of renowned warriors all over the world.[CR]Like Toshinden 2, Ulimate Remix Attack adds 3 new fighters over its prequel; RonRon, Ripper and Tracy and three new bosses and secret characters bringing the total number of fighters to 15. The original Toshindens final boss and also Remixs exclusive character have been removed.[CR]Ulitmate Revenge Attack's game play could be described as a hybrid of the Playstations Toshinden 1 and 2 with movement like the former but the latters combo system.</plot>

Players can compete in these locations in three different ways. One way, is called war, with the objective to destroy every one of their opponent's ships. Another way, is to play capture the flag, which has the player trying to sink their opponent's flag ship and then return the flag back to their own harbor. The final way is called capture the harbor. This has the player attempt to drop marines, who are being carried inside a troop transport, off into their enemy's harbor, so the harbor can be attacked and captured. In this mode, players also get to choose between playing as one of several countries, or have a balanced or custom naval force. This choice affects the number of units of each type of ship the player starts the battle with.[CR]The game features 8 types of ships which are aircraft carriers, destroyers, battleships, cruisers, patrol boats, mine layers, troop transports, and submarines. Each ship has different ratings in the categories of top speed, target range, hull strength, main guns, special weapon, and defensive weapon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] has players moving their ships strategically on an overhead map. When two ships move close enough to each other, a battle can happen. In the battle, players try maneuvering a target reticule on their opponent ship to attack them, while also attempting to move out of the way of their opponents attacks. Once one of the ships health meters become empty from taking to much damage, they are sunk.</plot>

It is notable for being one of the first 3D platformers, beating Mario 64 to the market by about a year. A PC port of Bug!, made by Beam Software, was released in 1996.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Unlike Mario, Bug! is a very linear game, while players can go any way they please, most of the game is made up of narrow walkways essentially. In addition, the game is structured much like a linear 2D platform game where Bug has to get from point A to point B, as opposed to the more freeform gameplay of later 3D platformers. The story was also fairly unique in that Bug was a movie star, and the whole scenario was merely a fictitious movie that players were shooting; in other words, none of the characters were ever in any real danger.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Burning Rangers is a third-person action platformer developed by Sonic Team and released in 1998 for the Sega Saturn. Released at the end of the consoles lifespan, the game is considered to have the most advanced graphics for the Saturn platform, an improvement on what the development team learned from NiGHTS, two years earlier. In the game, the player takes control of one of several firefighters, who using advanced exo-suits and fire-extinguishers, navigate burning structures, putting out and avoiding fire and teleporting survivors to safety.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Burning Rangers    In Burning Rangers, the main threat to the player is fire. While there are rogue security bots and aliens later in the game, neither are as prominent as fire. The player must navigate the burning structure, sometimes moving underwater and even zero gravity, using their jetpack to move through the area and using an arm-cannon to extinguish flames. The player must do this quickly, as a limit meter slowly rises the more fire there is. As the meter hits certain amounts like 50%, the area will explode around the player, giving them just seconds to react. A chime is played just before an explosion triggers, if the player is quick and jumps, they will do a backflip and avoid the explosion. If the player is lost at any point in the game, they can press the Z button, where the Team Navigator, Chris, will give them directions on where to go. At the end of the level, they face a boss which require a certain strategy to defeat. The player is given their score, with a rank ranging from F to S depending on their time, amount of survivors rescued and what the limit meter was at various points in the level. Extinguishing fires earns the player crystals. Crystals have two uses: Similar to rings in Sonic The Hedgehog, these crystals protect the player from death. As long as the player has at least one crystal, they will be protected. Like the aforementioned game, contact with fire will cause the player's crystals to fly out from them, but can be recollected if the player is quick enough. If the player is burned without a crystal in their possession, they will die and lose a life, sending them back to the last checkpoint. The second use of the crystals is to rescue survivors from danger. Each survivor requires a certain amount of crystals in order to teleport them out of the building, if the player uses more crystals than the required amount they will earn additional lives. At the end of the mission, the player may receive fan-mail from survivors they have rescued. If the player manages to find and rescue a cameo member of the development team, they will receive a password to unlock some of the game's extras. On completion of the game, the player unlocks a random level generator. In this mode, levels are generated randomly, adding to the game's longetivity.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mission 1: Fallen MemoryMission 1 establishes the game's mechanics.     The first mission takes place at a power plant, where fires have broken out due to a breach of the core reactor, trapping researchers and personnel inside. The team are tasked with containing the spread of the fire and rescuing survivors. After moving through the facility, they attempt to override the CPU of the reactor, only for it to be rejected. They discover that the main reactor is being controlled by a giant plant, which has mutated due to genetic experiments performed by a lead researcher, whose intended to discover the cure to a disease that took the life of his wife. The team manage to stop the plant by traveling to the 99th floor and severing the plant's connection to the reactor, deeming the mission a success. Mission 2: Silent Blue Underwater gameplay...      The second mission takes place at an underwater aquatic theme park called Ocean Park, located in New Zealand. A fire of unknown origin has broken out and the automatic evacuation system has failed, reportedly trapping 30 maintenance crew inside. The team investigate the maintenance area, but Big and Lead report they have just found over 200 children, apparent special visitors for the park. Without enough crystals to rescue them all and water levels rising, the rookies are sent to detach the upper part of the park where the children are located. With the help of a Dolphin, they manage to travel through water passages and get to the joint area, where they discover a large aggressive fish and a transmitting device. After managing to destroy the fish, the successfully detach the upper part of the park, saving the children. When they return to their transport vessel they scan the transmitting device, learning that it received a signal from quadrant RK404. They leave immediately to discover the origin of the signal.Mission 3: Gravity Zero ...Space gameplay!      On arrival at quadrant they discover that a nearby space colony 'Firebird' has been hit by debris from a nearby spaceship, the origin of the signal. The Burning Rangers enter the colony to investigate and rescue any survivors. With some of the gravity control systems malfunctioning, they are forced to navigate some of the colony in zero gravity. They move through the colony extinguishing fires and acquiring keycards from survivors to access further areas. When one of the rookies finds a young boy, the colony starts to deteriorate and due to a magnetic shield storm are the rookie and young boy are unable to be transported. The rookie carries the young boy on their back and without the use of their extinguishers, must escape the burning colony. They manage to find an escape pod, but when there is only room for one, the rookie puts the boy inside and promises they'll find another escape pod and give them their autograph when they get back, secretly unsure of whether they can keep their promise. The rookie sets off to find another escape pod when they stumble upon another transmitter. An unknown female voice warns them that the colony's defense system has been activated, summoning a hybrid robot forcing the rookie to deactivate it. When they think it's over, the nearby spaceship begins absorbing the colony and with the transporter still malfunctioning and communications cut, the rookie is trapped inside...Mission 4: Winged Cradle The team head for the core.  The rookie wakes up inside the derelict spaceship. With communications to the Burning Ship still blocked, they must employ the help from the mysterious voice to navigate the strange structure. When they manage to find and destroy the source of the magnetic shield, the mysterious voice reveals herself to be Iria Klein. At the age of 16, she developed an incurable desease, so her father put her into cryogenic statis aboard the space ship and programmed it to orbit around Earth, until a desease could be found. In order to protect her, he cloned his conciousness into the spaceship's main computer memory banks. After a while however, the computers artificial intelligence started to malfunction, obsorbing all floating material in space it came into contact with, creating a large shield. When the ship receieved a transmission that a cure had been found, it began carrying out it's final instructions to land back on earth. With it's vastly increased mass however, this would act a meteor on a collision with Earth. With it's outer shield nearly invincible, the only way to stop it is to destroy the main computer. Tillis faces the corrupt AI.      With the magnetic shield disabled, the Burning Man is able to enter the space ship and make contact with the rookie, transporting them onto the vessel. With their objective realised, they fly through the outside perimeter and head for the main computer at the core of the ship. There they are able to find Iria's statis pod and transport it to safety. The rookie then successfully destroys the main computer,  with the team managing to transport the rookie back to the Burning Man moments before the entire spaceship explodes. In the epilogue, the doctor is again busy working on a cure, the dolphin from Ocean Park has returned safely, the child who was rescued is already planning to become a Burning Ranger and Iria has just become the most recent addition to the team.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] The Burning Rangers.     Burning Rangers features a futuristic team of firefighters. At the beginning of the game the player has access to two characters, the most recent additions to the team, rookies Tillis and Shou Amabane, both whom lost their family in a fire which aspired them to become Burning Rangers themselves. Other members such as Big Landman and Lead Phoenix are unlockable via passwords. The team's navigator Chris Paron provides vital information to the team from 'Burning Ship', their transporter vessel.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Burning Ranger's soundtrack was released in 1998 and composed by Naofumi Hataya, who has composed several other titles for Sega. Several songs feature vocal work from Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, who also appeared on the soundtrack for Daytona USA.

		<plot>Link 3 or more colored bubbles by shooting an identical colored bubble. When they are joined together, they pop.[CR]This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).</plot>

She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls.  Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.[CR]Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare "Fleshies" and thwart Casper's efforts.  The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.</plot>

		<title_clean>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams...</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Christmas Nights is a Christmas-themed reskin of Spring Valley from Nights into Dreams, plus a new 2nd version of that stage.Christmas NiGHTS is an extended demo of the original NiGHTS: Into Dreams. Featuring identical gameplay, it gives players the opportunity to play as either Claris Sinclair or Elliot Edwards (as well as the game's namesake, NiGHTS) in the level "Spring Valley" reskinned to match whatever season it is in real life. (Determined by the Sega Saturn's internal clock.) Like the original NiGHTS into Dreams, the ultimate goal of the level is to fly around and reclaim the four "Ideya" spheres that have been stolen from you. After collecting an Ideya from an ''Ideya Capture'' the player must return to the Ideya Palace at the start of the level to be graded on their performance and to start their quest for the next one. Collect all four, and players face off against a boss: in the case of the demo, a giant winged lizard called Gilwing.Unique to Christmas NiGHTS is a bevvy of holiday-themed goodies - the biggest of which being the title's namesake; if the Sega Saturn's internal clock is anytime within the month of December, the entire demo transforms to feature an all-new Christmas-based storyline and visual style, in which Elliot, Claris, and NiGHTS are tasked with retrieving the missing Christmas Star for the city's giant Christmas Tree display. Christmas NiGHTS's version of Spring Valley is completely revamped with holiday graphics and music, and NiGHTS itself is decked out in a Christmas costume. Playing Christmas NiGHTS at any other time of the year will simply result in the game referring to itself as "NiGHTS: Limited Edition".Christmas is saved!Completing "Spring Valley" as either Claris or Elliot will reveal an icon-matching Memory minigame. Match two icons and players will unlock that specific extra. Which extra the player unlocks corresponds to which icons they matched. The extras in Christmas NiGHTS are surprisingly extensive for a demo, including things such as concept art image galleries, archival video of NiGHTS into Dreams trailers from the Tokyo Game Show, enhanced music players, tools to analyze the player's save data and progression from the full retail version of NiGHTS into Dreams, and even a bonus mode where players get to control Sonic the Hedgehog running around Spring Valley with 3D gameplay, ending with a custom boss fight against Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik. (Which turns out to be a reskinned version of one of the bosses from NiGHTS into Dreams, although playing as Sonic instead of Nights provides a gameplay twist.)If the player completes Spring Valley as both Claris and Elliot in a single sitting, the ending to the game will play out, complete with the game wishing the player "Merry Christmas".[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]ClarisSpring Valley (This is the same stage as the one in NiGHTS into Dreams.) ElliotCharacter select screen.Spring Valley (This is in fact an all new stage, although the same environment.)Unlockable StagesFrozen Bell, for Link Attack Mode. (But only MARE 1 is used. The full stage remains exclusive to NiGHTS into Dreams.)Although not a new stage, Sonic can be unlocked and played as in Spring Valley. (His gameplay is similar to playing as Claris and Elliot, but Sonic is slightly more powerful than they are.) This mode is called ''Sonic into Dreams''.[CR]Unlockable Presents[CR]The unlockable content in Christmas NiGHTS includes: NiGHTS MuseumThis makes up the bulk of the unlockables in Christmas NiGHTS. There are 15 image galleries total.Karaoke ModeThe main theme song of NiGHTS into Dreams, "Dreams Dreams", plays with viewable lyrics and various audio altering options.Link Attack ModeTry to keep your "link combo" going as long as possible in the first section of Frozen Bell, from the full version of NiGHTS into Dreams.Time Attack ModeCollect all the items in the first section of Spring Valley as quickly as possible.Melody BoxListen to all the 20 different variations of each song from all the levels in NiGHTS into Dreams.Nightopian CollectionCheck the moods of all the hundreds of little Artificial Intelligence creatures that populate the levels in your save file for the full version of NiGHTS into Dreams.Movie FilesView both the Tokyo Game Show 1996 and Summer Special 1996 trailers for NiGHTS into Dreams.''SONIC into Dreams''Run around Spring Valley as Sonic the Hedgehog as you race against the clock to complete the level on foot.RealaUnlocked by playing on April Fools Day, this option allows you to play as Reala, a boss character commonly known as NiGHTS's evil twin from NiGHTS into Dreams.Christmas NiGHTSAfter completing Christmas NiGHTS, you are given the option to play it at any time of the year. [CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Christmas Nights asks the player to confirm the time and date.The music for both NiGHTS into Dreams... and Christmas NiGHTS was composed by Naofumi Hataya, Tomoko Sasaki, and Fumie Kumatani. The game contains one vocal track which is "Dreams Dreams", by Akira Sasaki with vocals by Curtis. King Jr., and Dana Culitri[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The concept of changing seasons and holiday-themed costumes for Christmas was something SonicTeam wanted to implement in the main NiGHTS into Dreams game, but did not have time to.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Clockwork Knight - Pepperouchau's Adventure</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Clockwork Knight is a platforming title by Sega that was released as a launch title for its Saturn console. The player is put in the role of Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III (the titular Clockwork Knight) and must traverse a house in order to rescue his love interest, Clockwork Fairy Princess Chelsea.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Protagonist Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III, a clumsy toy soldier known as the Clockwork Knight, is completely head over heels in love with Clockwork Fairy Princess Chelsea, who wakes all the toys in the house up in the middle of the night for a wacky song and dance extravaganza. Unfortunately for Pepperouchau, however, his less-clumsy, more dashing rival Ginger is also in love with Chelsea. As par for the course in situations like these, Chelsea is kidnapped by some sort of mysterious force and Pepperouchau and Ginger must go on an epic quest to rescue her, or else the toys' days of crazy midnight parties will come to an end forever.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Clockwork Knight plays very similar to many other 16-bit platform titles. Pepperouchau's main attack involves using a key as a sword; a quick tap of the attack button makes him thrust quickly, but holding the button down makes him hold the key outward and twist it, which does more damage to energy but also makes Pepperouchau stand still. In addition to this Pepperouchau can throw stunned enemies as well as various objects that are scattered around the levels.The objective of each level is to simply get to the end before the timer runs out. The game has thirteen levels, with every third level being a boss battle. After each boss battle the player is given a chance to play a roulette mini-game to obtain extra lives or crowns, the game's main collectible item. There is no save game function in Clockwork Knight.[CR]Art Style[CR]Clockwork Knight's graphics are pre-rendered 2-D sprites based off of 3-D models, a technique that Rare's Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct games had made incredibly popular in the mid-90s. The game's bosses, however, are fully polygonal, and, as the Sega Saturn was a CD-based format, the game contained a fully 3-D rendered intro.The pre-rendered CG art style and the concept of living toys make the game seem extremely similar to the Disney/Pixar film Toy Story, although Clockwork Knight was released almost a year earlier than Disney's film.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Clockwork Knight's sequel, predictably named Clockwork Knight 2, was released in America the same year as the first title. A prototype for another sequel, Clockwork Knight 3: Penguin War, has been discovered and chronicled on the website X-Cult. The game would've been a Bomberman clone, with screen shots showing a 12-player multi-player mode.Clockwork Knight has seemingly been forgotten by the general gaming public, overshadowed by other classic Sega titles of that time period.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Base-building is at the heart of Command &amp; ConquerCommand &amp; Conquer (also known as Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn) is a critically-acclaimed real-time strategy game developed by Westwood Studios and originally released in 1995. The first entry in the long-running Command &amp; Conquer franchise, it is often credited, along with Westwood's previous game Dune II and Blizzard's Warcraft II, with popularising the genre and establishing many genre conventions which persist to this day.Command &amp; Conquer is set in an alternate history 1995 and focuses on the conflict between the GDI, a multinational military organization, and the Brotherhood of NOD, an ancient and mysterious terrorist group lead by the enigmatic Kane. The two factions primarily vie for control of the mysterious substance Tiberium, which acts the as game's sole resource.The game was released as freeware on its 12th anniversary and can be downloaded from EA's official website.[CR]Factions[CR]Command &amp; Conquer documents the First Tiberium War, which pits the Global Defense Initiative (GDI), lead by General Mark Sheppard, against the Brotherhood of Nod, lead by Kane. Players can take control of either faction in the single-player campaign or multiplayer skirmishes.Global Defense Initiative (GDI)The Global Defense Initiative (GDI) is a military alliance of Western nations operating under the auspices of the UN Security Council. GDI commanders field an array of mostly conventional units, who fare well in a head-to-head confrontation but lack flexibility compared to Nod.   Brotherhood of NodThe Brotherhood of Nod is an ancient and mysterious terrorist group devoted to its charismatic leader, Kane. Nod are masters of asymmetric warfare, with units that, while generally weaker than their GDI counterparts, excel in unconventional warfare.   [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Command &amp; Conquer is well known for its mix of unintentionally hilarious FMV and CGI cut-scenesA mysterious alien plant-like crystal, named Tiberium, has been discovered by Doctor Ignatio Mobius on the banks of the river Tiber in Italy. Kane, leader of the secretive Brotherhood of Nod, disputes this, claiming that the substance was in fact first discovered by Nod, and named by Kane after the Emperor Tiberius. Tiberium Crystals are easy to harvest and full of potent elements, and so it rapidly becomes the most valuable mineral in existence. Both the Global Defense Initiative (GDI), and the Brotherhood of Nod begin harvesting Tiberium to fund their respective war efforts.Kane wants to spread Tiberium throughout the entire world, having humans accept it and live with it, all the while using it to create an army to rival that of the GDI. On the other hand, the GDI has found Tiberium to be deadly to humans and plans to remove it from Europe, while also using Tiberium as a resource to fund their war against Nod. The subsequent conflict between the GDI and Nod is known as the First Tiberium War.EndingsThe GDI campaign is considered canonical by subsequent games in the series.GDIAt the end of game, GDI forces destroy the heart of the Nod empire at the Sarajevo Temple of Nod. The base can either be destroyed by an ORCA attack or by an Ion Cannon. In both cases, the final cut-scene show Kane inside the base as it's levelled, he is assumed to be dead.NodIn this ending, the Brotherhood of Nod successfully capture the codes to access the GDI's Ion Cannon. The player can then choose to destroy one of four historical world landmarks &#8212; the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, the White House or the Brandenburg Gate.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]GDI CharactersGeneral Mark SheppardGeneral SheppardSupreme Commander of the GDI and hero of the First Tiberium War, General Sheppard played a pivotal role in defeating the Nod. During the game Sheppard is put in the spotlight after his forces are accused of a civilian massacre in Poland. Eventually, due to his persuasion and charisma, the charges are dropped and it is discovered that the whole event was fabricated by the Nod to discredit the GDI and cut of their funding. The plan backfire against the Nod and General Sheppard is able to lead the GDI to victory.Colonel J.C. CarterColonel CarterA GDI field commander who gives missions and briefings to the player. During the game, he plays a big role in battles taking place in Estonia in which he requires your assistance to overcome the Nod forces.M.O. MorelliM.O. MorelliLeader of the GDI air force and an experienced pilot, Morelli is a cool head who provides you a few missions during the game. In the First Tiberium War, she is responsible for helping you with the defense of Bialystok and recovering nuclear material from the Brotherhood of Nod.Dr. Ignatio MobiusDr. MobiusThe world's foremost expert on Tiberium, Dr. Mobius was the first person to discover the mutagenous substance (a claim disputed by Kane). He is known to be quite a mad scientist and needs protection from Nod forces during the game.Nod CharactersKaneKaneThe Supreme Leader of the Brotherhood of Nod, Kane is a devious and ruthless man who will do anything to accomplish his goals. He believes that Tiberium is the future of mankind and that only Nod can harvest its true potential.SethSethSecond in command and Kane's right-hand man. In the campaign, Seth is your immediate superior and tasks you with most of your missions. As the game progresses, he becomes increasingly jealous of you and the attention you are getting from Kane for being so successful. Eventually, he tries to send you on a suicide mission to destroy the Pentagon but Kane steps in and shoots him. The player is then promoted to Seth's position.Greg BurdetteGreg BurdetteA reporter working for the WWN network, Burdette is secretly working for the Nod. During the first Tiberium War, he films a report claiming that GDI troops slaughtered innocent civilians in Bialystok, Poland. In reality, the whole report was created behind a green screen under the guidance of Kane. The anti-GDI propaganda temporarily works and GDI's funding is cut by the UN.OthersFemale ReporterFemale ReporterAn unnamed female reporter who appears at the end, newscasting the conclusion of the game on national television. Depending on the player's actions, the Female Reporter will broadcast different story on each play through. She talks in a very slow and off-beat tempo.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The CD coverThe soundtrack is composed by Frank Klepacki and published by Westwood Studios. The double-CD soundtrack consists of 22 tracks with a combined duration of approximately 72 minutes. The soundtrack was bundled with some of the collector's editions of the game. On November 1, 2005, the soundtrack was made available on iTunes &#8212; fully remastered with some enhancements made in to each song (eg. extra vocals)."Act on Instinct" (2:45)"No Mercy" (3:21)"Industrial" (2:52)"Iron Fist" (3:29)"We Will Stop Them (Deception)" (3:07)"Radio" (2:59)"On the Prowl" (2:59)"Recon" (4:18)"Drone" (4:13)"In the Line of Fire" (2:02)"Prepare for Battle" (3:27)"Depth Charge" (4:12)"Rain in the Night" (2:34)"Creeping Upon" (3:39)"Target (Mechanical Man)" (2:49)"Just Do it Up (Just Do it)" (2:20)"C&amp;C Thang" (3:10)"To Be Feared" (2:41)"Drill" (4:28)"Full Stop (Warfare)" (5:02)"In Trouble" (3:07)"Air Strike" (3:11)[CR]System Requirements[CR]DOSWindowsProcessor: 486 DX2/66 or higherProcessor: Intel Pentium 60 MHzRAM: 8 MBRAM: 8 MBDisk Space: 30 MBDisk Space: 30 MBGraphics Card: VGA Video Card (320x200 pixels 256 colors)Graphics Card: 1MB Direct Draw compatible video card (640x480 pixels 256 colors)Sound Card: 100% Sound Blaster compatible sound cardSound Card: 100% DirectSound / Windows 95 compatible sound cardOS: MS-DOS 5.0 or higherOS: Windows 95 or higherCD Drive: Double SpeedCD Drive: Double Speed[CR]EVA Game Installer[CR]EVA InstallerOne unique feature of the DOS version of Command and Conquer was the game installer. In the game itself, the Electronic Video Agent (commonly referred to as EVA) is an AI which processes and conveys information to commanders on the battlefield. In the installer, EVA speaks to the player guiding them through the installation process as if they were connecting to a sophisticated military network.Parts of the final install process from installer was shown the first time the Windows 95 version was launched (the Windows 95 installer was a generic install Wizard though), and was part of the intro movie for the PlayStation version (which had no actual install at all). The sequence shown in these versions is a cutscene of the final files being copied to the system, and the computer linking up with the EVA command systems, as well as the words "Welcome, Commander", which became a recurring phrase throughout the main C&amp;C series.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Because of strict laws in Germany and the possibility of it being outlawed, all soldiers were replaced with robots which didn&#180;t spill red blood when killed and a different sound effect was added. All FMV was dubbed in German too.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Croc is a third-person, 3D platform game starring a crocodile named Croc, who is trying to save furry little creatures called Gobbos from the evil Baron Dante. Croc must travel across four islands to find and save all the Gobbos, dealing with the Baron's henchmen along the way.Croc was originally conceived by Argonaut as a Yoshi game, but Nintendo was not interested in publishing it, so a new character was substituted.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are four islands and one secret island in the game. In each of the four main islands there are six levels, in which Croc has to collect six Gobbos and five Colored Crystals. The Colored Crystals open the Crystal Door at the end of each normal level which contain the sixth Gobbo required. This is usually the hardest part of the level.Each also contains two Boss Levels, in which Croc collects crystals instead of Gobbos and fights a boss at the end of the level. If all six Gobbos are collected in each set of three levels, and the boss is defeated, two secret levels are unlocked in which Croc has to find jigsaw pieces. Collecting all eight jigsaw pieces in each secret level grants access to the secret island.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Gobbo King, King Rufus, was watching the sunset when he noticed a small basket in the lake, containing a small, screaming baby crocodile. The Gobbos begin to raise him and train him to become one of their own. Croc mostly ate buckets of peas when raised by the Gobbos. Croc eventually grew to twice the size of a normal Gobbo. All was peaceful until one day suddenly, the evil Baron Dante arrives and invades with the help of his demon minions, Dantinis. He imprisons many of the Gobbos, most notably their King, who he keeps in a steel cage within his castle island. Before the Gobbo King is taken, he hits a magical gong that summons a yellow bird called Beany. Beany, in turn, causes Croc to shrink and he whisks Croc away to safety. Croc then goes on a quest to free all the Gobbos and defeat the evil Baron Dante himself.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Silencer, ready for action.It's 2196 and in the future, the World Economic Consortium controls nearly every facet of life as we know it. As a Silencer, players are an elite member of a private military force dedicated to providing covert problem solving for the WEC.Returning from a mission to eliminate civilians under the pretext that they were rebels, the Silencers that had refused the order are making their way back when they are attacked by a military servomech. As the only survivor and having witnessed the true face of the WEC, players join the Resistance.Crusader: No Remorse is an isometric action game developed by both Realtime Associates, Inc. and Origin Systems. The main designer was Tony Zurovec.The packaging for the game was notable for including a number of items created to enhance the player's immersion into the backstory regarding the world of Crusader. This was typical of many titles released for the the PC at the time, such as Maniac Mansion's inclusion of a mock-bulletin board poster or the newspaper that came with Alone in the Dark, before the practice became relegated to providing material for Collector's Editions.A manual titled "Anti-Terrorist Site Security" described the security features and enemies of the WEC within its fiction intended as an introduction for those working within the corporation. Another booklet, titled "Resistance Confidential", described the various weapons and dangers within the game from the rebel point of view. A newsletter was also included showing the news for the day, albeit from the WEC's perspective.The game was built with the same engine behind Ultima VIII, but was heavily modified for its debut as an action game. CG cinematics alongside live action cutscenes (as well as photographs of actors in their respective roles for use within the included booklets) were used to help detail the world.Assets in the game were not in true 3D. Instead, they were represented by meticulously animated 2D stills of 3D-rendered objects with a number of explosive and gory special effects similar to that of Diablo.Crusader is also notable for its extreme violence, especially with the death animations suffered by player's targets. Enemies can die a variety of ways from the player, either by simply being shot or by having their flesh burned off leaving only their skeleton to fall to the ground.Destructibility also played a part within the game with many objects, such as barrels, storage tanks, and even office cubicle walls, valid targets for the player's many weapons.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The SilencerThe Silencer and a RP-32 Pacifist assault rifleThe silent protagonist of Crusader: No Remorse. His true identity is unknown as shown in the intro cutscene, the mech is unable to identify Silencer. A Captain in the MilOps Cartel armed forces and a former Silencer Corps member of WEC, The Silencer is a highly trained soldier who is heavily armed, deadly accurate, and depending on the player's own moral compass, a ruthless killer. He also has a variety of special items at his disposal including spider bombs and detonation packs. The Silencer joins the Resistance after the murder of two of his fellow Silencers. His missions vary from saving key members of the resistance to destroying strategic WEC assets.    Anton ZurovekOne of the two companions of The Silencer killed in the intro scene by an AP-4400 mech. He had been in service as a Silencer since February 2193.Marcus VitekThe other companion of The Silencer. He met the same fate as Anton.

In November of 2181, he disappeared while assigned as an instructor at the Academy. In March of 2183, he emerged as the leader of a resurgent Resistance military force. As the most visible symbol of the Resistance, he has been Security Cartel&#8217;s Public Enemy #1 since June of 2184.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, conspiracy, murder, terrorism, and political agitation.Major Stephon ElyThe Major runs the rebel base in Sector 5 and is the man The Silencer reports too.Citizen # 9A-8T99-5613-XXX.Stephon Ely gained an ROTC military commission and enlisted for active duty immediately after college. He served in a Special Forces mechanized infantry battalion, first as a platoon leader, then as a staff officer. Other than the fact of qualifying for Special Forces duty itself, his career was undistinguished. In 2189, then-Captain Ely&#8217;s chances for further advancement were shattered when he was reprimanded for questioning his C.O.&#8217;s orders during a routine riot-control operation. Six months later he left on a two week leave and never returned.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, conspiracy, murder, terrorism, kidnapping, and desertion.Jo Anne VargasVargas is the only member of the Resistance saved during the second mission of the game.Citizen # 4V-9G31-4556-XXXJo Anne Vargas was at one time one of the Communications Cartel&#8217;s most promising young public relations specialists. She has undergraduate degrees in literature and art, masters degrees in communications and marketing, and a Ph.D. in socio-economics. In 2192 she resigned her executive position in the cartel and announced she was taking an unpaid leave of absence of unspecified duration.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, conspiracy, and political agitation.Sargeant Shannon BrooksCitizen # 2N-9U3-2214-DXXShannon Brooks is a second-generation rebel. Her parents joined the Resistance shortly after her birth, in the wake of the &#8216;60s food crisis. They were killed during the Petra Insurrection of &#8216;92. Both were members of the central committee of Petra&#8217;s &#8220;provisional government&#8221; at the time of their deaths. When Quentin Maxis revitalized the military arm of the Resistance in the early &#8216;80s, Brooks rapidly emerged as an extremely active and efficient terrorist operative. She is known to have been involved in the sabotaging of the supertanker Cordelia in &#8216;84, and to have led the force that destroyed the Osaka chemical plant in &#8216;92.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, murder, terrorism, arson, assault, kidnapping, and grand larceny.Troy ReavesNicknamed "Wizard", Troy is responsible for insertion and extraction for Silencer, hacking teleporters to allow him to move from the Rebel base into mission areas, and get him out just as quick.Citizen # 7B-8Y21-5489-XXXTroy Reaves has been a computer hacker for his entire life, spending his adolescence at the Dormitory for Incorrigible Youth at the Information Cartel Technical Institute. Although his technical aptitude was prodigious, all attempts to turn his skills to more responsible channels failed. In the end he was discharged from the Information Cartel and assigned to Maintenance Cartel as a sanitation worker. He vanished from Maintenance Cartel training after less than a week.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, data terrorism, unauthorized access to secured nets, fraud, extortion, and grand larceny.Nicholas CardovaThe player first meets "Yo-Yo" in the cantina and tells the player to back off, or else.Citizen # 6Y-5B52-4589-XXXNicholas Cardova displayed radical tendencies as far back as grammar school. His college career (majoring in political science) was interrupted his sophomore year by a three-year sentence for disseminating anti-Consortium propaganda. Immediately after his release he was recruited by the Resistance and went underground, where he has remained for most of the last decade.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, terrorism, assault, kidnapping, and political agitation.Derrick AndrewsNicknamed "Taxman", Andrews is one of the few rebels sympathetic towards Silencer after returning from a mission in which many rebel prisoners die.Citizen # 46-9L22-1677-XXXAndrews worked as an associate accountant in the Revenue Assessment Division of the Administrative Cartel for almost a decade without incident, but had a moral crisis triggered by witnessing Consortium action to suppress the El Paso Tax Insurrection of &#8216;89, causing him to abandon his loyalty to the WEC. In 2192 he went underground.He is currently under the command of Shannon Brooks.Wanted by the WEC for: Treason, terrorism, espionage, and assault.WeaselWeasel is the black market vendor of the game. He is often seen with a ferret sitting on his shoulder. Some of his known aliases are: Alvin Tarkin, Alberto Devense, and Sally Horrowitz.Citizen # UnknownWeasel appears to have never been registered as a citizen of the WEC, based on retina-scans obtained from video images. WEC investigators theorize that he may have been raised in a refusenik encampment by individuals opposed to universal registration for political or religious reasons. His given name is unknown &#8212; none of his known aliases match the names of any known refuseniks. What is known is that about 2193 he emerged as the most successful black marketeer in his region.Wanted by the WEC for:Treason, terrorism, kidnapping, black-marketing, conspiracy, grand larceny, petty larceny, smuggling, hijacking, gun-running, arson, assault, blackmail, extortion, fraud, battery, organ-legging, bootlegging, pandering, felonious misrepresentation, unauthorized impersonation of a citizen, impersonation of an officer, maintaining a bawdy house, tax evasion, unlicensed ownership of a firearm, exploitation of a minor, and failure to register identity.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]No Remorse is a solo, isometric shoot 'em up where the player tackles fifteen different missions across a variety of environments ranging from manufacturing plants to office spaces in a quest for vengeance. There are sixteen weapons in the game that the player can purchase or find as well as a number of interactive sites within each area that the missions take place in.InterfaceA bar on the bottom of the screen displays the current weapon, ammunition remaining, equipped special item, health, and shield strength. Health is provided by medical kits or through special devices along with shield recharge.The player has a full 360 degree range of aim around himself and the keypad can be used as a control, although it is often better to use the mouse instead. Sidestepping, rolling to avoid enemy fire, and even jumping are all useful in avoiding an early death from the many dangers that are encountered from both foes and the environment.Searching bodies for ammo and cash to purchase items on the black market is important, and the player can also talk to Resistance members back at their base in between missions to learn more about the story or what they were expected to do next.EnvironmentThe Silencer faces traps and underpaid security guardsThere are a large number of destructible assets within the world of No Remorse ranging from toxic barrels to office cubicles. Many of these can be used against enemies, often with devastating results such as setting them on fire.The player can also take control of certain servomech droids through interface panels to help them pass difficult areas or to solve puzzles such as activating lift buttons to access unreachable spots or in using their superior firepower to blow through enemy forces.The degree of detail within each area is considerable and often leads to frenetic firefights through a variety of corridors and scientific laboratories. Each area is often populated by security forces, robots, and engineers or scientists.Traps consist of a mixed variety of environmental dangers (such as exploded pipes blowing flame) to deliberate traps and security measures including laser barriers and turrets.There is no alignment or reputation system in place, so the player could be free to almost do whatever they wanted while fighting for the Resistance. Civilians within each area will often surrender, but can also be killed for whatever goodies (often credits) that they might have. The choice is up to the player, but has no ultimate bearing on the outcome of its linear narrative.LocationsThe rebel base that serves as the player's hideout is accessible only from in between each mission and is not a true hub. Using the teleporter sends the player immediately to the next mission once they get their briefing instructions.A Black Marketeer is also on hand to resupply the player with medical packs, ammunition, and even new weapons if they can afford them. Talking with the other NPCs can reveal different aspects to the storyline.Encounters and CombatThe security forces of the WEC will be the player's primary antagonists throughout the game. They normally consist of a mix of the following:A lowly guardA highly trained enforcerGuard - These are the most common sight within the game, easily dispatched and most likely not trained well enough to run away from real danger.Soldier - Slightly better paid than the guards and better armed, they're found everywhere the WEC has an interest in.Special Forces - Highly trained and deadly, these are often armed with standard slug throwers and energy weapons.Enforcer - Elite members of the WEC's military, they have a personal shield like the Silencer and aren't afraid to wade in with the heavy stuff.Silencer - These are what the player used to be; unfailingly loyal super-soldiers armed with whatever they can get their hands on, which usually means the best stuff. They are the absolute best in service to the corporate cartels of the WEC.Combat is handled by using the keypad or the mouse to aim a reticle on the screen at prospective targets and then simply firing at them with whatever they are equipped with. Obstacles can be used as cover (although not as part of a cover system), or shot through if they are destructible.Weapons, Equipment, and RobotsSixteen different weapons are found in the game along with a number of armed servomechs that can be remotely controlled to cause additional collateral damage. There are also a variety of different pieces of equipment that can be purchased or found in the game.WeaponDescriptionDesignBA-40 PatriotA pistol slug thrower. Small, but useful.BA-41 PeacemakerA slightly better version of the pistol.RP-22 ConciliatorA compact, burst firing rifle that deals a considerable amount of damage. Especially useful against soldiers.RP-32 PacifistA more powerful 3-burst-fire assault rifle based on the RP-22 featuring a larger magazine and flash suppressor.SG-A1 ConformerA standard, yet powerful shotgun with a fantastic range and spread.AC-88 ReaperThis riot gun is one of the most powerful anti-personnel weapons the WEC has at their disposal. A variation of the Conformer, the Reaper fires at more than twice the rate of its shotgun counterpart.SW-404 SpitfireThis unique weapon designed as an anti-sniper and anti-siege weapon, fires a low powered shell, that immediately splits into 3 smaller shells that spread out in a fan formation. It is an absolutely devastating weapon.GL-303The grenade launcher which is great for wiping out floor installed enemies, turrets, and destructible targets like barrels and people at a distance.PA-21 ArbitratorA laser weapon that does decent damage.PA-31 AdjudicatorA standard laser rifle. An efficient and powerful energy weapon, affectionately called the "Lightning rod".PL-1 UnifierThis plasma rifle turns enemies into energy vapor leaving only a memory behind.EM-4 VortexFast firing energy weapon that doesn't do much damage, but is useful for its speed an accuracy. It is better served as anti-servomech weapon.UV-9 PulsarA rifle that fires a pulse of ultraviolet energy that fries the flesh off of whoever it hits, usually resulting in immediate death and is not issued to anyone outside of field trials. This is one of the more gruesome weapons in the game. It's closest contemporary could be traced to the Type-7 particle weapon in Monolith's F.E.A.R..EquipmentDescriptionDesignDetpacSet and watch the fireworks from afar with this remotely detonated surprise.Limpet MineDetonates when the enemy gets too close for comfort.Spider BombAs the Resistance guide describes it, an "ambulatory munition" controlled by a "joystick unit".Ionic ShieldSurrounds the player and absorbs kinetic energy from projectiles, greatly reducing damage taken.Plasma ShieldA stronger variant of the ionic shield, it envelops the player in a sphere of protection.Graviton Shield This rare, experimental shield protects the wearer in a space-time distortion field. While active, it is impenetrable. However, the duration is quite short and its use is currently relegated to protecting VIPs.EMP InhibitorGreat for zapping robots, but drains energy quickly requiring a good stock of energy packs.MedkitRestores a large chunk of health to the player.Batteries and Power CellsNeeded to power shields and other equipment, these items can be found in many areas.Energy CubeRestores a very small amount of shield. Data LinkUsed to review mission objectives. ServomechsDescriptionDesignMS-40Called the "Roaming Susan", this is normally used for maintenance although it comes armed with a pistol. Just in case.MS-110Also referred to as "Android", the MS-110 is a far more advanced, humanoid variation of the MS-40. This servomech can be programmed to complete complex technological and laboratory tasks. It is not however, used primarily as a defensive mech, as the expense made to increase the "brains" leaves it with a low defensive power.AP-4210Also referred to as "Thermatron", this lithe, two-legged mobile minigun, it might not be well armored but it can cut a swath through soldiers and security troopers.AP-4400Sometimes called "Vetron", the big brother to the AP-4210, this hulking platform can demolish most anything in its way, including other servomechs, with relative ease. WEC expects to replace its AP-4210s completely by 2201.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP / VistaProcessor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 350 MB available space[CR]System Requirements (Mac)[CR]MinimumOS : OS X 10.6.8 or newerProcessor : Intel Core 2 Duo 2 GHz+Memory : 1 GB RAMGraphics : 64 MB VRAMHard Drive : 350 MB available space[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cyberia was originally released for MS-DOS in 1994. In 1995, the game was brought to PC-98 and FM Towns. The following year, 1996, brought console releases for Playstation and 3DO. Developed by Xatrix Entertainment, Inc and published by Interplay Entertainment Corp.A shortened version of the game, consisting solely of the first half of the story, was released along with graphics cards under the title Cyberia: Mission Norway. A sequel,  Cyberia 2 : Resurrection, was released in 1995 for PC only.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Cyberia relied heavily on two major gameplay systems, puzzle solving and on rails shooting. The majority was based around the puzzle solving, with the player taking control of a hacker named Zak as he wandered the halls of various complexes, usually watching employee's video emails. However, Zak would sometimes find himself in control of a few vehicles, which is where the on rails shooting came in. At the beginning of each game the player could specify the difficulty of both independently, although both couldn't be set to easy as the game considered it "too easy".[CR]Gamer Culture[CR]While at Game Informer, in 2012, Dan Ryckert, took place in a full replay of the game. A PlayStation 3 was used for the replay and ran for eight one hour episodes. At one point, they entertained the idea of switching to an original PlayStation. The original PlayStation supported mouse controls and they felt the game was nearly unplayable with a controller. Tim Turi, the player, nearly gave up several times, but was constantly goaded by Dan Ryckert. The video series can be found on Game Informer's YouTube channel.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dark Savior for the Sega Saturn is a spiritual successor to Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole for the Sega Genesis. Dark Savior shares Landstalker's isometric viewpoint and Legend of Zelda styled adventuring aspects. Climax decided to include a fighting game styled battle system that allows the player to capture their opponents and use them in battle.One major feature of Dark Savior is that it included a unique parallel story system that allowed players to alter the story by arriving to certain events at specific times. For instance, if the player is able to reach the captain's quarters before the main villain in the game's opening sequence, the captain would be saved and main villain killed, thus altering the whole story. This feature not only explored different aspects of the plot and characters, but also enhanced the replay value of the game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins on a ship heading to Jailers Island to turn in Bilan. Garian is informed by a ship mate that Bilan has escaped. He also finds a mysterious Blue Rose that seems somewhat familiar.Garian and his bird partner, Jack make there was to the captains deck to find Bilan is there. Depending on the time taken, the captain is either dead or alive.Parallel 1: 4 minutesGarian find the captian killed by Bilan and fights him. Bilan escapes towards Jailers Island. Garian comes after him.Parallel 2: 3-4 MinutesGarian gets there in time to see the Captian fending off Bilan. He then kills Bilan and goes to Jailers Island seeking the Diary of Wooda.Parallel 5: If Garian loses to Bilan, he is killled, and sent to a purgatory where he faces characters from all the parallelsParallel 3: 3 Minutes and under Garian finds Bilan and locks him out for the safety of the ship. He then goes after him.Parallel 4 begins after Parallel 3's completion.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Dark Savior is unique. For most of the game, It is viewed in a isometric angle, this is used for portions in which Garian must roam around a town talking to various NPCs. This is also used for the sections which involve platforming puzzles.When in battle, the game shifts to a simple 2D fighting game with the same isometric viewpoint. You can also fight with monsters captured from previous fights. There are also moments that take place in a mine cart, and have a different 3D viewpoint with a shifting camera.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Dark Savior received mediocre reviews by critics, but maintains a small, cult following on the internet.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In 1999, Climax developed a spin-off of Landstalker: The Treasures of King Noble called Time Stalkers (Climax Landers in Japan) for the Sega Dreamcast. Unlike the two previous games, Time Stalkers eschewed the action based combat for a turn based system.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]It released in Japan arcades in August 1993, with its debut at the 1993 JAMMA arcade show there. It was followed by a worldwide arcade release in 1994, and then a port to the Sega Saturn console in April 1995. Daytona USA sets the player against a challenging array of computer controlled racers, where they must make a mad dash to the final lap before time runs out. All of this takes place on 6 race tracks ranging in difficulty from beginner to expert.Daytona USA was Sega's first title to debut on the Sega Model 2 arcade system, and, at the time of its 1993 debut, was considered the most visually impressive 3D video game up until then. Despite a slightly lower overall polygon count than its spiritual predecessor Virtua Racing, Daytona's 3D world was fully texture-mapped and filtered, giving it a more realistic appearance. Daytona was the first 3D video game to feature filtered, texture-mapped polygons (the first use of trilinear texture filtering in gaming), giving it the most impressive 3D graphics yet seen in a video game up until that time.[CR]Saturn version[CR]Daytona USA is the first of Sega's 3D arcade racing hits to be released on home consoles.Arcade ModeThis mode is an exact port of the original arcade game; complete the race before time runs out. The timer slowly depletes as the player races around that track, but upon each successful lap a few extra seconds are rewarded. There are 3 different tracks to choose: beginner, advanced and expert. Depending on which track is chosen, the course could be a standard NASCAR oval or a curvy mountain raceway. There is also a choice of either automatic or manual transmission.Saturn ModeThis mode is exactly the same as Arcade Mode the only difference is that the tracks can be played forward or backwards.Launch GameDaytona USA was a North American launch game for the Sega Saturn (SS) on May 11, 1995. The game launched alongside other Saturn launch titles that included:Virtua FighterPanzer DragoonThat's right, the Saturn launched with only three games in North America.[CR]2011 Downloadable Version[CR]In October 2011, the game was re-released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. It received numerous updates, such as a HD 720p resolution, online leaderboards and multiplayer, and karaoke mode.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>All of its predecessor and then some.  More tracks, many more cars (hidden cars as well), smarter AI, more music (no more lyrics for the in-game race music either), broader 2-player gameplay, more refined arcade physics...and on top of everything else- BETTER GRAPHICS!  The first Daytona on the Saturn boasted some hefty visuals, great for displaying the Saturn's power to the masses at the console's birth; but for the Saturn to be revered for everything it was, Sega (and AM2) had to make something a little flashier.  All the graphics in the game have been updated...both the cars and tracks have higher polygon count, better texture mapping; the framerate is QUITE noticeably improved, everything is very smooth.</plot>

		<plot>This is a Daytona USA: CCE version that takes advantage of the online feature of the Net Link, an accessory for the US Saturn that among other things, allowed web browsing, IRC, e-mail, and of course, online gaming with the games that supported it. This game, at first, could be just brought from Sega directly, but nowadays it can be found in several specialized shops, plus the second hand market. It included two manuals, one in colour (the original from Daytona USA: CCE), which also served as a cover, and another in black and white, where it explained how to play online. Besides online gaming, you could also play offline. Nowadays it's still possible to play online with a direct call modem-to-modem, but not anymore through the more handy NetLink Zone, since the servers were shut down in 2001.</plot>

		<title_clean>Dead or Alive</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dead or Alive is a 3D fighting game developed by Team Ninja and designed by Tomonobu Itagaki. The game was a last ditch effort from Tecmo to save itself from bankruptcy (hence the project name), and the game would prove a success. Dead or Alive was first released in Arcades in 1996, using the Sega Model 2 arcade board and the same engine as Virtua Fighter 2. It was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and later to the PlayStation in 1998. The PlayStation version was almost completely redesigned to accommodate the system's superior 3D capabilities. This version was later released in arcades as Dead or Alive . The Saturn port (rather than the PlayStation version, due to licensing issues from Sony) later appeared in Dead or Alive Ultimate for the Xbox in 2004.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dead or Alive Gameplay (Saturn Version)Although many would think that Dead or Alive would share many similarities with Virtua Fighter 2 (which used the same board), it was quite the opposite. In fact, the game was completely different from Sega's masterpiece. The most obvious difference was Tecmo's decision to implement a counterhold system in Dead or Alive, instead of the conventional blocking system that all fighting games used. Of course, you could still block in DoA, but countering was a much more effective and worthwhile method.The other significant feature in the game was the Danger Zones. In each arena, there were areas that were labeled as Danger Zones, where your opponent would be knocked sky high if they happened to land on them after an attack. This would allow you to setup a powerful combo to knock them out. It's possible to escape the explosion from the Danger Zones, but the timing to pull it off was fairly strict, and you couldn't mash the buttons to escape it; Tecmo designed the technique in a way that if you happened to hit the buttons more than once when trying to escape, it wouldn't work at all.The underlying foundation of the game was based on the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. In Dead or Alive, Throws would beat Counters, Counters would beat Attacks, and Attacks would beat throws. It was a simple formula that worked surprisingly well in the game, and despite every fighting game using this formula to some degree, it was more defined in Dead or Alive than in other games.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]By completing the game each time using a character, the player can unlock additional costumes. Some costumes can only be unlocked on certain difficulties, however. Unsurprisingly, the amount of costumes that can be unlocked for the female characters greatly outnumber that of the male characters (Kasumi has 14 costumes, while Zack has just 5), presumably adhering to Itagaki's tastes. The game even has a 'Breast Bounce' feature in the options menu that can be disabled.CharacterInformationKasumiKasumiNationality: JapanAge: UnknownStyle: NinjitsuOccupation: NinjaKasumi's brother, Hayate, was next in line to succeed as the 18th master of the Mugen Tenkin Acedemy...

		<title_clean>DecAthlete</title_clean>
		<plot>Sega's own version of Decathlon, the most grueling of multi-event sports consisting of the 100-Meter Dash, Long Jump, Shot Put, High Jump, 400-Meter Race,  110-Meter Hurdles, Discus Throw,   Pole Vault, Javelin Throw and the 1500-Meter Race, split over two days of competition. Featuring eight athletes with different abilities and specialties, from the agile Karl Vain and Femi Kadiena, the fast Li Huang and Ellen Reggiani, the well balanced Joe Kudou and Rick Blade to the powerhouses Aleksei Rigel and Jef Jansens, the player must achieve the best scores possible in each event to get to the World's best results table, not only in the decathlon points table but also on the individual events table.[CR]All events follow the core gameplay of other athletics titles (such as Track &amp; Field), with some changes from event to event. Spriting events such as the  100-meter dash are pure button-bashing, with the 110-Meter Hurdles requiring an additional tap in the action button to pass the athlete at the correct time over the hurdle without losing speed or knocking it down. At the opposite level, the 400-Meter and the 1500-Meter Race add a stamina bar that must be kept above critical levels at all times to keep the athlete fresh until the end, this being done by simply pacing the number of presses done by the player (the 1500M also requires the player to steer the athlete in the best path: as close as possible to the inside edge without hitting other runners or losing speed from going over the edge). Jumping events, along the javelin, require a fast build-up, an well-timed action (be it jump, set the pole or release the javelin), and setting the most appropriate angle. Discus is the only event where button mashing isn't required, and asks the player to rotate the D-pad clockwise to build strenght, followed by a push of the action button to set the angle of release as well as the direction. [CR]Like in the original ST-V version (which means it is in every way similar to the arcade version), two players can compete at the same time in the running event, and at the 1500M race six drones compete at the same time.</plot>

		<plot>All contact is lost with a submarine on a routine mission which then crashes into an underwater facility. The occupants of the underwater facility are ordered to board the submarine and find out what went wrong. On board the vessel, strange things are happening which are taking control of the crew. The crew are mutating due to an alien parasite and members of the search team have to figure out what is happening and how to stop it![CR] The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.</plot>

		<plot>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.[CR]The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.[CR]A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. [CR]As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Since it's release in 1995 the game has been known for it's rather huge success and  Reflections has later released several instalments based on the the original Destruction Derby. The point of the game is to wreck your opponents car to score points. The goal players have to achieve in the game is fairly simple, but the popularity of the game grew by the minute, which then resulted in  Reflections releasing  Destruction Derby 2, the second instalment in the successful franchise.  Several other Destruction Derby games have been released over the years, but the most memorable and successful is unfortunately only  Destruction Derby 2.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The game was unlike most other racing-games at the time of release, since the point of the game is to wreck your opponents car to score points - a gameplay concept which was new to the racing-game industry at the time. The basic idea of Destruction Derby is based on a real-life sport which involves, again, wrecking the opponents car. The winner of the &#8220;race&#8221; is the man who is left-standing with his car still intact - &#8220;Last Man Standing&#8221; kind of deal. In the game, when a round is finished the winner is decided by having the most points or by being the only car still intact, just like the real-life sport. This is what makes Destruction Derby unique and so popular, but there are other modes in the game where different rules apply.   [CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR] Destruction Derby includes four basic modes which players can choose from. Wreckin' Racing In this mode there is a standard racing track involved where the player races against the opponents, fighting over the the best position (just like most racing-games) as well as gaining the most points by smashing up and wrecking the opponents car.  Stock Car Racing  Here, the only goal is to make first place or at least get into the best position possible. The key element when playing this mode is to avoid inflicting damage to the car so possibility broken parts wont slow the player down when fighting for a place at the podium. This is the only mode in the game which breaks of from the main concept where wrecking cars and inflicting damage is awarded. Simply put, this mode works like any other standard racing game. If the player comes first, he wins.   Time Attack  Standard time attack/time trail mode.   Destruction Derby This is the mode which got most attention upon it's release and is the most popular mode in the game. The mode takes place on a track called The Bowl which is a large open track. The only goal here is to inflict as much damage to the opponents car and at best, completely destroy them.   [CR]Cars[CR] There are three sets of car classes to choose from in the game &#8211; Rookie, Amateur and Pro. These three different classes represents three different difficulty levels. Rookie is the easiest, Amateur being the normal difficulty and Pro is the hard difficulty setting. The main difference between the classes can be noticed as you go up through the cars they get faster and have better handling. But the car will also be able to handle less damage and is basically weaker as the difficulty level is higher.   [CR]Tracks[CR] Cactus Creek City Heat  Crossover Ocean Drive  Speedway The Bowl Ruined Monastery   [CR]Damage Engine[CR] In Destruction Derby when the players car takes a heavy hit and the car gets severely damaged, the damage engine makes sure the handling of the car decreases. For example, when the player gets hit at either side of the car and takes massive damage, the car will pull slightly to the side the car got hit. There are many ways the players and the opponents car can be slowed down. In some cases the players car can become almost impossible to drive because of the heavy damage it as taken. This is all being realised with the damage engine Reflections built for the game. There is no pit lane in the game, so repairing the car is not possible. Reflections did however include such a functionality with later instalments. The player can monitor the cars &#8220;health&#8221; by looking at the damage indicator at the bottom right of the screen. The indicator shows ten locations the car can take damage. How serious the damage to the car is, is shown by colour. Green means there is no damage taken at all, yellow means the location is slightly damaged, orange indicates a pretty rough hit has taken place and finally red means there is severe damage to the location.  [CR]Other[CR] The game is playable as single-player and multi-player.The game is currently available on Playstation Network for download for both the PSP and the PS3.  [CR]Trivia    [CR] The game was originally called Demolish 'em Derby, but the name was changed only months before release.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Die Hard Trilogy</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Die Hard Trilogy was developed by Probe Entertainment, who were later acquired by Acclaim. The game is an adaptation of the first three Die Hard films. Because each Die Hard film is represented by a different genre - Die Hard was adapted as a top-down third-person shooter; Die Hard 2: Die Harder was adapted as a Light-Gun shooter; Die Hard with a Vengeance was adapted as a driving game - Die Hard Trilogy was marketed as being three games in one, as the three "games" which were on the disk had enough depth to act as stand alone arcade titles.The games were developed as if they were arcade games. A running score is kept at the top of the screen across the three different modes, and typical arcade conventions of continues, high scores, scoreboards, and lives were applied.Die Hard Trilogy was very successful upon release. The game was banned in Germany, due to excessive violence and gore, particularly in the Die Hard with a Vengeance segment, where players can run over innocent pedestrians at will. The game sold enough to make Sony's Greatest Hits line in North America, and the Platinum line in PAL territories. A sequel, Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas, developed by n-Space, was released four years after Die Hard Trilogy.[CR]Games[CR]Die HardPlayers are put into the shoes of John McClane as he ascends Nakatomi Plaza, eliminating terrorists and saving hostages.The adaptation of the first film sets the player in Nakatomi Plaza with little reference to the film's original story. Instead, players make their way up each individual floor, from the ground floor at the bottom, to the top floor, some thirty-five storeys up. The different floors are made up of the roof, a parking garage, a ballroom, maintenance levels, office levels, and computer levels. Key to the gameplay was the top-down camera view and the tank controls which were toned down to make them more responsive and less taxing on the player.Each level is packed full of terrorists, all of whom the player must eliminate in order to complete the level. Once all terrorists are defeated, a bomb timer is triggered in one of the elevators in the level. The player has thirty seconds to reach the elevator in which the bomb is located - should they fail, a game over is triggered. Hostages are scattered throughout each environment, and the player gains health by saving them. There are also a myriad of pickups, including several special weapons such as assault rifles and shotguns which fire incendiary rounds. Each environment had many destructible aspects. Office divider walls break apart when shot; levels under "construction" can be razed to the ground.Throughout Die Hard, the player character - apparently John McClane, though this is never strictly stated other than in the manual for the game - utters several one liners from the film, and ones uniquely recorded by a Bruce Willis sound-alike for the game.Die Hard 2: Die HarderTerrorists are highlighted on the screen with crosshairs. The enemies that pose the greatest threat are highlighted in red.Die Hard 2 puts the player in John McClane's shoes. The game is played as a first-person shooter (though strictly speaking it is an on-rails light-gun game, and plays similarly to how Time Crisis plays without a light gun). Nine different levels are included in the game; each level takes players throughout the different settings from the film - the airport, the runway, the plane, the church, the snowmobile fight, among other locations.Similarly to the adaptation of Die Hard, terrorists and hostages are scattered throughout the levels. If the player shoots hostages they lose a significant amount of health. Terrorists drop armor and weapons when shot. The player can also use different types of ammunition, such as tracer rounds, as well as grenades and missiles. In order for items to be collected, the player shoots the highlighted pickups on screen. Several different types of enemies attack the player. Often, "Head Honchos" spawn into the levels, which are effectively sub-bosses. If the player does well in key areas in each level, secret areas can be unlocked with more weapons and health and ammunition.Die Hard 2 can be played with the PlayStation controller, or with the Scorpion light gun.Die Hard With a VengeancePlayers can drive around large levels in Manhattan, attempting to disarm bombs set by terrorists.With a Vengeance takes the player away from the shooting mechanics of the other two games and puts them behind the wheel of a New York cab. Similarly to the level structure of Die Hard 2, levels are taken from locations all over the film. The player must drive around in large, city-like areas and disarm bombs that terrorists place down around the city. Bombs are disarmed when the player drives over them.Because time limits were particularly harsh in this portion of the game, the player can drive at tremendous speed, and can collect pickups which add to the "nitro booster" of the cab, or which slow down time. Hitting the shoulder buttons of the PlayStation controller will make the cab instantly turn at a ninety-degree angle; supposedly this feature was to be used for turning around tight corners in the city portions of the game. Civilians play a large role in the early levels, as they often line the sidewalks - sidewalks which the player can use as shortcuts to avoid traffic. The player has the ability to drive into innocent people, the result being an explosion of blood splashing across the windshield.[CR]Development [CR]Originally the game was envisioned as a PlayStation exclusive, but development went smoothly enough to allow an avenue for a port of the game for the Sega Saturn and the PC before development on the PlayStation version was even completed. Both versions required further development, because the method of handling polygons in the game engine - particularly on the Sega Saturn - was a very different from the PlayStation.Die Hard Trilogy was one of many games on the PlayStation to feature Redbook Audio. Redbook Audio was normal CD audio burned onto the CD past the game files. This allowed for there to be high quality music that did not need to be converted through the PlayStation's sound chip; instead it could be played like a typical CD.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doom is a science-fiction/horror first-person shooter developed and published by id for the PC on December 10, 1993. As a nameless space marine, players trek through 27 levels (split up into three episodes), where they liberate space stations from demon infestation in both Phobos and Deimos, only to take on Hell. The game's engine (later known as id Tech 1) is known to pioneer new features to the genre, including non-perpendicular walls, complex rooms (known as "sectors") with varying height differences, multiplayer (both co-operatively and competitively, for up to four players at a time) and the concept of packaging the game's content (levels, sounds, and music) into singular files (WAD files) for easier modification and distribution (leading to the birth of the modern mod-making community).The lore of the game, set sometime into the future, involves the Union Aerospace Corporation (U.A.C.), a multi-planetary conglomerate that has been utilized by the Earth military to secretly experiment on alien teleportation technology discovered on the moons of Mars. As they try to establish a gateway between the two moons using this technology, the experiment goes awry and the demons of Hell use the portals to invade the two moons. As the last man standing guarding the Hangar of the U.A.C. space station on Phobos, the lone space marine must fight through the onslaught to keep them from attacking Earth.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Doom, players progress through each level, blasting away enemies while solving puzzles (involving switches, keycards, and skull-shaped key devices), avoiding environmental hazards (such as crushing ceilings, radioactive acid, and burning lava), and collecting weapons, ammo, and other items (including first-aid kits, body armor, suits that protect from radiation, night-vision goggles, computer maps, and supernatural orbs that grant a special bonus to the player). Unlike id's previous first-person shooter, Spear of Destiny, Doom does not include a scoring or lives system. Players who die can retry the level at the cost of resetting their inventory and stats.Episodes and DifficultiesThe game's campaign is split up into three episodes (each with eight normal levels and one secret level):Knee-Deep in the Dead - The only episode playable in the shareware version, the first episode deals with the marine's journey through the base established on Phobos.The Shores of Hell - After defeating the two big bruisers guarding the teleportation gateway, the marine passes through into Deimos. As the invasion continues, the base becomes more distorted with hellish architecture. The second episode deals with the marine's liberation of demons from the Deimos base.Inferno - Eventually, the marine fights a giant anomaly of flesh and metal (known as the Cyberdemon) in the "Tower of Babel", only to find out Deimos has been teleported to the infernal afterlife, and that the tower connects the moon to Hell itself! The third (and final) episode has the marine blindly wreaking havoc in Hell until he can find the mastermind behind the invasion.Players who are starting a new game can start at the beginning of an episode (starting with no armor and a pistol with 50 bullets). Starting from the second episode, players can find two new cell energy weapons (the uncommon Plasma Gun and the rare BFG-9000) and two new common enemies (the Cacodemon and the Lost Soul). Players can pick between five (four before game version 1.2) difficulties (known as "skill levels"):I'm too young to die. - Fewer monsters (and more items) than normal. Double ammo granted on weapon and ammo pickups. Players take half damage.Hey, not too rough. - Fewer monsters (and more items) than normal.Hurt me plenty. - Normal difficulty.Ultra-Violence. - More monsters (and fewer items) than normal.Nightmare! - Added in v1.2. Cheat codes are disabled. More monsters (and fewer items) than normal. Double ammo granted on weapon and ammo pickups. Monsters react and move faster, and respawn shortly after death.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]FistFistDamage: 10 per punch, 200 with Berserk PackOne of two starting weapons. The fist is simple and effective against weaker enemies but when a Berserk Pack power up is activated it boosts the attack power of the fist considerably allowing you to tear through and even gib many enemies with ease.From the manual: Can be used to punch enemies. It will always be with you.ChainsawChainsawDamage: 20 per 'hit'A powerful melee weapon capable of stunning some enemies.From the manual: Cuts down the baddies like standing timber, but you have to get close.PistolPistolDamage: 10 per bulletThe second starting weapon. The pistol is one of two weapons to utilize bullets as its ammunition.From the manual: Your standard military-issue weapon. It will stay with you, so don't forget about it if things get tough.ShotgunShotgunDamage: 10 per pellet, 7 pellets per shell, 70 damage maximumThe shotgun is a very effective weapon to use on most enemies you will encounter. its multi-pellet spread is very useful for crowds. The shotgun is the only weapon to use shells as its ammunition.From the manual: Deliver a heavy punch at close range and a generous pelting from a distance.ChaingunChaingunDamage: 10 per bulletThe chaingun, like the pistol uses bullets as its source of ammunition. This rapid-firing machine gun can stun some enemies so it is most effective against a single enemy.From the manual: Direct heavy firepower into your opponent, making him do the chaingun cha-cha.Rocket LauncherRocket LauncherDamage: 200 per rocketThe Rocket Launcher is one of three weapons capable of gibbing enemies. Rockets deliver splash damage very well so they are ideal for dealing with crowds. This weapon is the only one in the game to use rockets as its ammunitonFrom the manual: Deliver an explosive rocket that can turn one bad dude inside-out.Plasma RiflePlasma RifleDamage: 20 per cellThe fastest firing weapon in the game, this weapon is very powerful and effective against whatever it is you may encounter. The plasma rifle is one of two weapons to utilize cells as its ammunition.From the manual: Shoot multiple rounds of plasma energy - frying some demon butt!BFG 9000BFG 9000Damage: 1000 per blast, 40 cells expendedThe BFG 9000 fires a huge plasma ball which moves slowly through the air. Upon impact, the target it hits receives a huge amount of damage and lots of splash damage as well.From the manual: The prize of the military arsenal. Great for clearing the room of an unwelcome guest. Shoot it and see for yourself.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Former HumanHealth: 20Total in single player (ultra violence) : 311From the manual: Once a marine, always a marine-- except in this case. These guys may look like your old buddies, but now they're nothing more than pistol-toting bi-pedal maggots. Waste em!Former Human SergeantHealth: 30Total in single player (ultra violence) : 426From the manual: Ditto. Except these guys are meaner and tougher. These walking shotguns will provide you with a few extra holes if you're not careful.ImpHealth: 60Total in single player (ultra violence) : 719From the manual: You though an imp was a cute little dude in a red suit with a pitchfork. Think again. This Imp heaves balls of fire down your throat and takes several bullets to die. It's time to find a better weapon than a pistol if you're going to face more than one of these mutants.DemonHealth: 140Total in single player (ultra violence) : 389From the manual: Sorta like shaved gorillas, except with big heads and lots of teeth. They don't kill easy. Get too close and they'll rip your sorry head off.SpectreHealth: 140Total in single player (ultra violence) : 114From the manual: Great. Just what you needed. An invisible (nearly) monster. Did you expect a walk in the park?Lost SoulHealth: 100Total in single player (ultra violence) : 242From the manual: Dumb. Tough. Flies. On Fire. 'Nuff said.CacodemonHealth: 400Total in single player (ultra violence) : 126From the manual: They float in the air, belch ball lightning, and have one horrendously big mouth. If you get too close to one of these monstrosities, You're Toast.Baron of HellHealth: 1000Total in single player (ultra violence) : 37From the manual: Tough as a dump truck and nearly as big, these goliaths are the worst thing on two legs since Tyrannosaurs Rex.CyberdemonHealth: 4000Total in single player (ultra violence) : 2From the manual: Half unfeeling machine, half raging horned devil. This walking nightmare has a rocket launcher for an arm and will definitely reach out and touch you.

The game engine was largely developed by John Carmack. 22 of the original 27 levels are included, though modified and simplified, and two new maps are included. Music is only included during the title screen and between-level screens. Two player multiplayer Deathmatch and Co-op modes are available through JagLink.The code developed for this port served as the basis for future ports including the Sega 32X (which was released before the Jaguar version), the 3DO, GameBoy Advance, and PlayStation.Game Boy AdvanceBased on the Jaguar port, the GBA version of Doom was released by David A. Palmer Productions in 2001. Five new multiplayer-only maps were designed for this version.iPhone / iPod TouchAn official iOS port of Doom, titled Classic Doom, was released by id Software in 2009. The port is based on the source port PrBoom which allows for OpenGL rendering.LinuxThe Linux port of Doom was created by Dave Taylor of id Software and released in 1994. The source code of this port was made available to the public in 1997 and is the basis for all subsequent source ports.MS-DOSThe original version of doom.PlaystationDoom on the Sony Playstation is more of a re-imagining. It features slight variations of levels from The Ultimate Doom and Doom II: Hell on Earth. This version of the game uses modified versions of the Jaguar maps.There was more of an emphasis on mood and atomsphere compared to the PC version and utilized colored lighting. The game's soundtrack differs from the PC version and many enemy and weapon sounds were also changed to make them more intimidating. These changes made for a more darker and atmospheric tone for the franchise which carried forward into DOOM 3.Enemies from Doom II were added to levels from the first game for an added challenge. Fans of the game in Doom's active modding community have brought it to the PC using the ZDoom source port to add in the various graphical enhancements unique to this version of Doom.Playstation 3Released in 2012 in a collection called "Doom Classic Complete" which features The Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, Master Levels for Doom 2. This collection also includes the previously exclusive No Rest for the Living bonus episode from the Xbox 360 release of Doom 2. This port features a stripped down version of idtech 5 for networking and other PSN specific code written during the development of RAGE.Sega 32xPublished by Sega in 1994 this version of the game features 17 levels from episodes 1 and 2 but none from episode 3. The port was criticized for not running in full screen and not including the BFG-9000 weapon although it can be acquired using cheat codes. Just like the Super Nintendo version only the front facing sprites for monsters were included thus eliminating the possibility of monster infighting.When the player finishes level 15 while using cheat codes they are presented with a standard DOS prompt which will remain on screen until the console's reset button is pressed. Only when the player has progressed to level 16 without using cheat codes the gameplay will continue properly. The manual states that the player will start again at level 1 with cheat codes disabled after this point but it does not.Sega SaturnThe Saturn version is very similar to the Playstation version but does not include the colored lighting. The low frame rate compared to the Playstation version has this version lacking Doom's trademark fast-paced gameplay. It was said to include link support for Deathmatch and Cooperative multiplayer but was only included in the European and Japanese releases.SNESDoom on the Super Nintendo was released in September 1995 by Williams Entertainment is one of the few games to include a Super-FX 2 chip. This version includes 22 levels from the PC version and features the 5 missing levels from the Jaguar version but instead is missing 5 different levels and does not include support for saving your game progress.Due to hardware limitations monsters can only be viewed from the front making monster infighting impossible, floors and ceilings are not texture mapped and the spectre enemy is not included being replaced by the regular demon instead. Other limitations include not being able to play Episode 2: The Shores of Hell on I'm too young to die (very easy), and hey not too rough (easy), Episode 3: Inferno can only be played on the ultra violence (very hard) and nightmare (hardest) difficulties. Nightmare difficulty was changed to not have respawning monsters although they are still fast like in the PC version. The shotgun does not spread out but instead fires a single projectile equal to a hit from all particles in the PC version.Automap support utilizes Mode 7 scaling and rotation to allow the map to rotate around the player instead of the player's icon rotating inside of the automap itself a feature unique to this version of the game.The 2 boss demons, the spider mastermind and the cyberdemon are included in this version of the game which were missing from other ports of that era. Multiplayer support was included for gamers with X-BAND modems.WindowsBill Gates at a Microsoft event in 1995Known as WinDoom or Doom95, developed for Windows, unveiled in 1995 and released in 1996, this port capitalized on the popularity of Doom and was used by Microsoft to showcase their new DirectX technology. It supports screen resolutions up to 640x480 and features a GUI launcher allowing easy selection of episode, map, difficulty, custom wads, and multiplayer settings.XboxThis version of Doom was included on the disc with the collectors edition of Doom 3 along with Doom II. This version includes an exclusive secret map in episode 1.Xbox 360Released in 2006, this port was developed by Nerve Software and was made available for download in the Xbox Live Arcade. Single player contains all four episodes and supports multiplayer (splitscreen or online via Xbox Live) Deathmatch and Co-op with up to four players. The Xbox version includes achievements and leaderboards.[CR]Source Code Release[CR]Also see: Source PortOn December 23 1997, Doom's source code was made available to the public. This has now spawned many new 'Doom' engines, such as Boom, ZDoom, GZDoom (OpenGL), and Legacy, these engines and many like them have been developed to 'update' id Software's original engine and most now support all modern windows platforms, run in high resolutions, have optimized online code, free-look (up/down), jumping &amp; crouching, a console, and cross-hairs.These engines require the original DOOM.wad or IWADs to run, and are of course able to play modifications of these files such as NeoDoom.[CR]Unofficial Source Ports[CR]These ports were done after the release of idtech 1's Source Code in 1997. Some of these ports may require additional hardware or software to function.AmigaDoom was ported to the Amiga sometime in 1998 after the release of the source code.AndroidThere are a variety of ports available on the google play store which can be converted into the full version with the WAD files from the PC version.Sega DreamcastThe Sega Dreamcast has several source ports available. DoomDC, last updated in 2002 this source port was the first to be released. This version requires the Dreamcast Keyboard to use some functions such as switching weapons.Another source port is nxDoom which is based on DoomDC. nxDoom runs faster than DoomDC and supports saving, user WADs, .MOD music files, and has all of the games actions mapped to the controller.GP2xPrBoom and ZDoom were ported to this platform.Nintendo DSDSDoom is a port of Doom for the Nintendo DS. This version displays the game on the top screen while displaying the UI as well as automap or console output on the bottom screen. This version supports network play with any prBoom server. Music and custom control layouts are not supported.Nintendo WiiWiiDoom is a port of PrBoom. Doom, Doom 2, Ultimate Doom and Final Doom are supported. The only available control scheme utilizes the Wii Remote and Nunchuck attachment.Sony Playstation 3PrBoom was ported to this platform. This was the only way to play Doom on the Playstation 3 before the release of Doom Classic Complete.Sony Playstation PortableThe original Doom source code as well as Doom Legacy have been ported to this platform.Tapwave ZodiacZdoomZ, a PalmOS port of Linux Doom, runs on the Tapwave Zodiac.Microsoft XboxDoomX is a port of the original source code to the Microsoft Xbox.

Movement is controlled by either tilt or touch controls along with touch buttons for other game actions.[CR]Esoteric Source Ports[CR]Kodak DigitaOS Digital CamerasA dedicated Doom handheld was created using this port as a hackaday project.Doom 3 TerminalsPerhaps the strangest of them all this port requires a copy of the original release of Doom 3 and a PWAD. Once installed the mod includes a test map with a terminal which runs the original doom. Try it out.Garry's ModGMDoom is a partial source port of Doom to Garry's Mod. Weapons, enemies and their behavior can be added in while playing. The mod was released in march 2013 on Steam Workshop.iPodThis source port requires the RockBox alternative firmware. Due to the iPod's media-centric button layout harder difficulties such as ultra violence and nightmare may prove more difficult to play in this versions of the game. Installation instructions can be found here.TI-Nspire CalculatorsnDoom supports all retail wads for Doom, Doom 2, Ultimate Doom, and Final Doom.[CR]System Requirements[CR]Minimum System Requirements386sx IBM compatible computerMS-DOS v3.3 or higherVGA (320x200x256) graphics4mb RAMHard Drive - 4.8 MB (Shareware), 12 MB (Mail-order)[CR]Original Release Versions[CR]Shareware VersionIncludes one of the three episodesIncludes network and modem supportMail-order VersionAll shareware featuresIncludes all three episodes (three episodes each with eight levels and a secret level)Includes Plasma rifleIncludes BFG 9000Versionsv0.2 - February 4, 1993 (alpha version)v0.4 - April 2, 1993 (alpha version)v0.5 - May 22, 1993 (alpha version)v1.0 - December 10, 1993 (uses v0.99 engine)v1.1 - December 16, 1993v1.2 - February 17, 1994 (introduced modem support and Nightmare mode)v1.3 - undocumented / never releasedv1.4 - June 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.5 - July 8, 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.6 - August 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.666 - September 1994v1.7 - October 11, 1994v1.7a - November 8, 1994v1.8 - January 23, 1995v1.9 - February 1, 1995 (the final version)Ultimate Doom, released April 1995, used a slightly modified version of the engine however the version number was not updated.On December 23 1997 the Doom source code was released, this code has the version number 1.10Referencing this new version, source port authors (e.g., ZDoom) often began their versions with 1.11On October 4, 1993 an early beta version of the game was made available to journalists. While this version of the game is similar to the final version (unlike the earlier alpha versions) their are still several key differences most notably the BFG9000 which fired 40 quick bursts of plasma gun ammo. This was changed due to the large number of sprites on screen causing the PC to slowdown. Also, this version has a scoring system. The player could gain score by killing enemies and collecting score giving items such as the Demonic Dagger. The scoring system and scoring items did not make it into the final version of the game.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Force is a real time strategy RPG for the Sega Saturn. It was developed by Sega and released in 1996 in Japan. Working Designs translated the title into English and released it to the North American market in the same year . Players can select between six different characters, each representing a different kingdom, with another two characters made available upon completion. Gameplay is divided into three parts. The first is the administrative mode, which allows the player to manage castles, generals, and prisoners. The second is the map mode, which involves moving armies around a world map, capturing castles and clashing with enemy forces. The third is the battle mode, in which the player commands a general and their army of up to one hundred troops, which can vary from basic soldiers to zombies. These battles use a "rock, paper, scissors" format that is similar to those found in strategy games such as Advance Wars. The story unfolds through animated cut scenes and has multiple endings based on the kingdom the player initially chose.Dragon Force has appeared on many "Best of" lists and remains a highly prized game for collectors and strategy fans alike, with a cult following creating costs of up to $100 on eBay.A sequel, Dragon Force II, was released in Japan in 1998 but was never translated. Dragon Force was re-released in Japan in 2005 as part of the Sega Ages 2500 series on the PS2.[CR]Overarching Plot[CR]Legendra, a bountiful and joyous land blessed by the benevolent goddess Astea, who took a special liking to the inhabitants and blessed with great prosperity. This was not unnoticed, nor especially appreciated by the evil Madruk. Madruk led demonic forces against the peaceful inhabitants, scorching the lands and destroying all that was good. The people prayed for a miracle and were delivered one: the sacred dragon god Harzgalt appeared to defend the people from Madruk's advances. Madruk and the dragon engaged in a battle that reshaped the land, and shook the heavens. Finally, the dragon sealed Madruk away using the last bit of his power and passing into obscurity himself.Dragon Force opens with your chosen monarch meeting with their generals to see what direction their kingdom will take. Word has spread that Goldark has declared war against the rest of Legendra and that your nation has to mobilize against him, or risk being annexed by him. No one is sure what Fandaria is planning, but everyone agrees that something must be done. The game inevitably opens with your army controlling one or two castles and with gray bannered castles adjacent to yours which hold a small contingent of generals with a grudge against your monarch. Defeat them to progress to the game proper.[CR]The Major Powers[CR]Highland Kingdom:Highland Kingdom is led by King Wein and located in the southeast corner of Legendra. The generals are mostly knights and soldiers with command of the same troops.Monarch: Wein- As a king Wein is beloved by his kingdom and generals for his nobility and his willingness to listen to his subjects. He and Teiris have a shared past and a love that spans the land. Many of the generals throughout the game will join him willingly, having heard of his reputation for being a just leader.Fandaria Empire:The Fandaria Empire is led by the vicious Emperor Goldark. Goldark ascended to the throne by killing his brother and taking the empire by force. Fandaria is located on the northwest side of Legendra. Their initial generals are varied but are all quite powerful. Fandaria is locked at the beginning of the game and the player must complete the game as another country before unlocking Fandaria. The rest of the kingdoms despise Fandaria and no one will willingly join your empire.Monarch: Goldark- Goldark is a ruthless king who will do anything to bring peace to the land. He murders his wicked brother, the real culprit behind declaring war on the other kingdoms, to gain the throne and steer Fandaria into a less horrible direction, but in order to do that he feels the need to unite the land under his heel. He even takes the help of demons, phantoms and dragonmen to achieve his ends.Palemoon Kingdom:The Palemoom Kingdom is lead by the gentle Teiris and located on the eastern side of the continent. The inhabitants of Palemoon are comprised almost entirely of elves. The initial generals are mostly magic users with a fighter and a knight mixed in to help balance the force.Monarch: Teiris- The young Queen of Palemoon began her reign recently and has yet to prove herself. Her bubbly personality has endeared her to her more experienced generals, who are happy to help her through some of the pitfalls of royalty. She has a shared romatic past with Wein and the two seem eager to persue it again when their kingdoms make contact.Izumo Nation:The Nation of Izumo is led by the honourable Mikhal, an expert samurai. Izumo is located to the far west of Legendra, with Fandaria to the North and Bozack to the South. Thier warriors consist of ninja and samurai generals and troops.Monarch: Mikhal- The strong, silent, and incredibly honor-driven leader of Izumo despises the imperialistic nation of Fandaria not only because of their desire to annex Izumo, but because Mikhal suspects Goldark is responsible for killing the samurai king's father and desires revenge.Bozack Nation:Bozack is led by the gentle beastman Gongos. The Bozack Kingdom lies within the deep forests of the South and is surrounded by the oceansto the East and West. The inhabitants of Bozack are cat-like Beastmen.Monarch: Gongos- Gongos is a kind-hearted beastman who stands proud against many of the stereotypes held by the other kingdoms about beastmen. He constantly tries to hide this side of himself when he comes into contact with the other kingdoms, and seems to want to unite Legendra for fun.Topaz Kingdom:The Kingdom of Topaz is led by the solemn and deeply religious Leon, a strict martial artist. Topaz is located within the middle of the continent, North from Tradnor and directly East from Fandaria, creating tactical disadvantages as enemies can invade from all directions. The generals of Topaz consist mostly of Monks.Monarch: Leon- A disciplined, but very cocky, lord who rules his kingdom with an iron fist and a swollen ego. He has a great appreciation for strength, and will give his respect to any monarch who can show him excellence in combat and give him a run for his money. He winds up falling hard for the Queen of Tristan (after unmasking her and realizing she isn't a man).Tradnor Kingdom:The magical Kingdom of Tradnor is led by the childlike Reinhart, descendant of the war god Valhart and powerful magic user. Tradnor itself is located within the very centre of Legendra, South of Topaz. Whilst this provides them with the means to easily invade other countries, they are also sitting ducks for invaders. Tradnor's generals consist of powerful magicians and preists. Tradnor is locked at the beginning of the game and the player must complete the game as another country before unlocking Tradnor. Much of the Tradnor campaign is side-missions while waiting for Highland to unite the kingdom, and then turn over the reins of power to you.Monarch: Reinhardt- The youthful king of Tradnor is happy-go-lucky and rather politically savvy, with forknowledge of the Dragon Force, the insignia on his hand constantly visible rather than when other members of the Force are around. He is surrounded by generals who trust him with their lives and are ready to lay them down for his safety.Tristan Empire:The Empire of Tristan is led by Junon, the "Black Knight of Masked Death", so named by Junon's dark masked armour and deadly millitary prowess. Tristan is located to the far North of Legendra, within the snowy mountains. Tristan's generals consist of a seclection of knights and magic users, and they command Harpy troops.Monarch: Junon- Fearing that she'll be seen as weak, the Queen of Tristran donned black plate-mail armor covered in spikes with a menacing helmet to hide her true identity. Junon is has an icy personality, and even her generals don't get very close to her. Anyone wishing to get close to her must prove themselves worthy, most likely through military might.[CR]Combat[CR]When two armies meet, they go to the pre-battle menu where the cpu opponent selects which general will go into battle first. Then the player is allowed to select and combat commences. The two armies advance toward one another (or one advances on the other, depending on what orders are issued) and the units clash. Battle is over when one general retreats (and is therefore unable to continue the rest of the combat and may still be captured) or runs out of HP (at which point they're either captured or, very rarely, killed.) The generals don't just stand idly by though, they can hurl spells at each other and kill the oppositions units if they get close enough.[CR]Units[CR]The combat in Dragon Force revolves around unit strengths and weaknesses. Every unit is strong against some and weak against others some classes even have units they are exceptionally strong against.Soldier- The middle-of-the-road grunts. Almost every army has at least one general that specializes in soldiers. When factoring how useful a unit is, it is wise to base your choice on what it's strong against, not only the number of units it can dominate, but also how frequently the units appear in the game. For instance: Harpies have just as many strengths and weaknesses as a Soldier, but are strong against units that appear more often.Strong against: Beastman, Monk, Archer, Mage.Weak Against: Calvary, Zombie, Harpy, DragonEqual To: SamuraiCalvary-Slighty more specialized than soldiers, calvary attack more quickly and are marginally more powerful than standard soldiers, but have weaknesses to two of the weakest units in the game.Strong against: Soldier, Mage, Archer, SamuraiWeak Against: Harpy, Monk, Beastman, Zombie, DragonMonk- Overall a weak type, but is occassionally brought to prominence against very specific types of enemies.Strong Against: Mage, Archer, CalvaryVery Strong Against: ZombieWeak Against: Soldier, Samurai, Harpy, DragonEqual To: BeastmanBeastman- the wildmen of the forest could have used a bit more training it seems. Much like the monks, they are good only very specifically, but lack the monks' dominance over the undead.Strong Against: Calvary, Archer, MageWeak Against: Soldier, Samurai, Harpy, Dragon, ZombieEqual to: MonkArcher- the archer is one of two ranged units, and therefore gains a lot of use as long as you don't advance with them. The enemy will have to endure your rain of arrows to get near enough to harm you. This almost makes up for the fact that they have almost no strengths.Very Strong against: HarpyWeak Against: Soldier, Calvary, Beastman, Monk, Dragon, Zombie, SamuraiEqual to: MageMage- the other ranged unit in the game, magi, like their archer cousins, are limited in their strengths, but can be made useful by a strong enough general.Strong Against: Harpy, ZombieWeak Against: Soldier, Calvary, Beastman, Monk, Dragon, SamuraiEqual to: ArcherSamurai- Nearly identical to the soldier in terms of strengths, there is one critical difference: they are the only unit in the game are profecient against dragons.Strong Against: Beastman, Monk, Mage, ArcherVery Strong Against: DragonWeak Against: Calvary, Zombie, HarpyEqual To: SoldierHarpy- Mythical beast-women with wings instead of arms and razor-sharp talons, the Harpy is one of the strongest units in the game and one of the reasons starting as Tristan is a good idea for beginners.Strong Against: Soldier, Calvary, Samurai, Beastman, MonkWeak Against: Archer, Mage, Zombie, DragonZombie- Perhaps the second strongest unit in the game, the zombie has few weaknesses and often generals who command zombies have access to ressurrection spells, making an unending tide of rotting soldiers the last thing seen by the opposition.Strong against: Soldier, Calvary, Beastman, Archer, Samurai, HarpyWeak Against: Dragon, Monk, MageDragon- The mightiest of all units have only one weakness, and it's a weakness that only Izumo can assemble in any great number.Strong Against: Soldier, Calvary, Beastman, Archer, Monk, Mage, Zombie, HarpyWeak Against: Samurai[CR]Commander Units[CR]Commander units in Dragon Force have only a few stats because they do very little fighting on their own, can kill any normal unit in one hit, and take a set amount of damage from attacks. However, if both sides' units are eradicated, the commanders may enter into a duel where they take turns attacking one another until one runs out of health. This is where Attack comes into play, the higher attack, the more damage done in duels. Hit points and magic points are standard RPG fare, leadership is a unique quality: the higher leadership is, the better units will perform. There is also INT, but it's more related to a commander's ability to search castles for followers and items than to any combat situation. They'll be more likely to evade attacks, even by units that have the advantage over them, and will be more likely to land strikes of their own. Commanders can also cast spells that can vary in effect from killing opposing units, damaging opposing generals, and even draining the meter that has to charge to allow spells to be cast in the first place. Most of the spells are very similar to one another and fall into these basic types: direct attack, charge attack, army attack, and energy drain.Direct Attack- The general fires an upward arcing projectile, or leaps through the air themselves, that strikes the opposion general, but no units.Charge Attack- The commander hurls themselves forward, or a projectile again, through the opposing ranks killing anyone in their way, and delivers a brutal combo to the opposing general.Army Attack- A spell that strikes the army of the second unit, and can damage the general if the majority of the opposing units are near it.Energy Drain- Either a dagger or throwing star is tossed through the enemy ranks, killing any it touches and draining the energy meter of the opposing general.Thief: The thief has low-everything stats. Not very high attack, hit points, magic points, or leadership. They have access to spells that are good at draining opponent's spell meter, and often get a direct-attack as their final technique.Ninja: Very similar to the thief, but with a much higher attack rating. Also instead of throwing daggers for their drain spells, they throw large shurikens.Fighter: Very high attack and HP, and mid-range leadership, but this class has difficulty learning spells and often doesn't get secondary attacks until much later in their levels, as a result expect them to have low MP for the duration of the game as well.Knight: High attack and high leadership, mid-range MP and HP make the knight a versatile commander.Monk: Closer to the fighter in terms of attack and leadership, but much, much higher MP, the monk has a slew of secondary attacks that usually target the opposing commander directly.Beastman: Much like the units that share their namesakes, the monk and beastman commanders are extremely similar, with the beast commander having slightly lower leadership. The Beastman, however, has very high HP.Samurai: Great attack, spells that hit the entire army, and mid-range leadership make the samurai a force to be reckoned with.Mage: High leadership becomes critical for making their ranged-attack units hit their targets before their targets can hit them, and their brutal spells will ensure that the ranks of the enemy are severely thinned by the time they reach the other side of the battlefield. However their low attack and HP make them unsuited for duels.Dragonman: The rarest of all commanders, but brutally powerful attack, HP, MP, and even leadership make the dragonman a force to never be underestimated and always sought out, even if one commands an army of samurai.Other commander-types appear throughout the game, but they're unique to the character they represent (such as Gaul), and thus are difficult to classify against others.[CR]Tips and Secrets[CR]TIP: The game becomes much easier if you counter-attack immediately following an attack on your castle. By pausing as soon as you return to the map screen following a defensive victory, you can deploy an army that will catch the remnants of the attacking force. This allows you to capture more enemy generals and avoid prolonged stalemates.There are some what would be considered "side-quests" to be found in Dragon Force, usually by visiting the small villages scattered throughout the land and there are some castles more worth having than others.-Crystal Castle (not to be confused with "Claystal Castle") to the west of Palemoon's capitol will always have a Dragon Crest (an item that allows one general to command dragons) when searched, so should always be occupied by a general with high INT.Hidden CharactersPlease note that none of these characters can be found or recruited when playing as Goldark/Fandaria.VLAD &amp; SIERRA: Dispatch your monarch alone to Fiend Tower (which lies between Highland, Tradnor &amp; Topaz's territory, south of the destroyed castle Magicka) and you will encounter a vampire named Vlad. Defeat him and he will join you, on the condition that he be allowed to face his nemesis Ryskim later. Honor this promise when Ryskim appears, and Sierra will join you as well, break it and Vlad will permanently desert from your army.Both command Zombie troops, while Vlad's spells are Resurrect, Mega Tornado and Ensare, while Sierra learns Trident's Daughter, Resurrect &amp; Ensare. Sierra's resurrect spell is more effective, however.Vlad and Sierra are not available in Goldark's game. Completing this subquest as most monarchs also eventually leads to the resolution of Zanon's subplot.VANGAL: Visiting a certain town situated on a mountain will turn up a cave with a dragonman in it. The location depends on your sovereign.-Wein &amp; Teiris: SouthWest-most town in Highland's territory. -Mikhal: below Danyan Castle in SouthEast Tradnor. -Leon, Gongos, Junon: town between Travan &amp; Crystal castles(between Palemoon &amp; Highland' territory) -Reinhart: North of Estonia castle in Fandaria.Send your monarch to this location, and Vangal will attack, although he has no troops. Following his defeat, he will either join you(when playing as Teiris or Gongos) or depart for the time being. Several turns later, a 2nd dragonman named Zado appears and attacks your monarch's location. He has 100 Dragon troops, lots of MP and abnormally high defense, so be prepared. Defeat Zado twice and he will die.At the domestic session following Zado's 1st attack, Vangal will return and join you(providing he hasn't already). If Zado's 2nd attack hasn't come, Vangal will automatically be pitted against him when it does, and Zado's defense will be greatly reduced. Vangal learns Stone Pedestal, Sky Driver &amp; a high damage version of Flame Cannon, and starts with 10 Dragon troops.HAYATE &amp; SHIROX: Send any division/general to the town directly below Mikeral castle(the one on the border of Gongos, Mikhal &amp; Reinhart's territory) and you'll be attacked by a ninja named Shirox. Following the next domestic scene, send your monarch to where you fought Shirox &amp; Hayate will challenge them to a duel. Regardless of whether you win or lose, Hayate will join you. When playing as Gongos, Hayate cannot be recruited until the other monarchs return and join him.Hayate is the game's most powerful ninja general, while Shirox is so-so. They both learn Assassin's Star &amp; Mirage Star, while Hayate learns Cross Flash &amp; Shirox Reptile Cannon. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An alien invasion has begun on Earth. The aliens are turning police officers into Pig Cops, abducting women and impregnating them with alien fetal spawn, and generally causing massive death and destruction across a variety of locations. As Duke Nukem, players will make use of a variety of unique weapons, such as the Devastator, Shrink-ray or Freezethrower, all in the name of saving Earth's women and busting alien skulls. For the first time in the series, the franchise was taken to a first-person perspective and took the big rival franchise of Doom head-on. The gaming market was filled with first-person shooters at the time of release, but Duke Nukem 3D's unique mix of setting, attitude, and sense of humor made the game into an instant hit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The first level of the game.Duke Nukem 3D was a technical step forward for the first-person shooter genre at the time of release. The player was able to crouch, jump, and look up and down, which allows for more interesting level design and enemy placements than was previously seen in other games in the genre. To complete a level, the player must find the exit marker, which is depicted as a nuclear symbol, and press it. To reach the exit, the player must often search the level for key cards and open their corresponding doors. Unlike many other games in the genre at the time of release, the levels of Duke Nukem 3D took place in relate-able and recognizable real-world locations such as movie theaters, streets, Chinese restaurants, and even strip clubs.Another aspect of the level design that made Duke Nukem 3D stand out from other games in the genre at the time of release, was the unseen high amount of interactivity the player had with the game-world. Players have various ways of interacting with the environment; light switches can be turned on/off, urinals can be used, water can be drunk, strippers can be tipped, etc.Duke Nukem frequently spouts one-liners; the majority of which are lifted directly from various movies with heavy cult followings like Big Trouble in Little China, Army of Darkness, They Live, and others.Duke Nukem 3D contains a big roster of enemies ranging from simple sharks to huge missile-firing Assault Commanders. The enemies all have different characteristics and attributes, which allowed the designers to create interesting combinations to challenge the player. To overcome the enemies, the player had a wide range of very different and unique weapons at his disposal. Besides the traditional firearms such as a pistol and a shotgun, Duke Nukem 3D includes many innovative weapons such as the shrink ray, pipe bombs and the freezethrower.To further aid the player in their victory, the game includes various different useable items such as first aid kit, scuba gear, body armor; and more unconventional items such as Holoduke, steroids, and a jetpack. The Holoduke allows the player to place a copy of themself in the world for a limited time to confuse enemies, the Steroids allow the player to move faster for a limited time, and the jetpack enables the player to fly within the boundaries of the levels.MultiplayerCo-operative play.Duke Nukem 3D on the PC offers multiplayer via LAN and modem-based services for up to 8 players. The game's multiplayer can take place on the levels from the game's single-player as well as some included multiplayer-only levels. The included editor also allows the players to play on their own created levels. Duke Nukem 3D shipped with two modes of multiplayer, and a third was added in the Plutonium Pak.Co-operative allows the players to team up and play single-player levels together.Dukematch is the deathmatch of Duke Nukem 3D. The first player to reach a certain score, or being on top of the scoreboard when the time runs out, is declared the winner. It is also possible to set up teams, so that the players both have allies and enemies in the same match.Duke Tag is akin to the capture the flag game mode. This game mode is not available from any menu, but is in fact hidden in level E4L10. If the level in Dukematch is started with at least four players present, a switch at the starting area of player 1 will become visible. Pressing this switch will enable Duke Tag mode, and the players will have to choose whether they want to be on Green or Brown team by walking into a teleporter.When a game is in progress it is possible to communicate with the other players by typing chat messages. It is additionally possible to taunt the other players by making use of the game's 12 pre-recorded Duke Nukem one-liners. These can be played by pressing "Alt" + "F1"-"F12" during play.[CR]Technology[CR]Almost as important as the game itself was Duke Nukem 3D's use of Ken Silverman's Build Engine. The Build Engine allowed for rooms to be built directly above another, sloped surfaces, and even moving geometry. The player is able to interact with the environment in revolutionary ways, causing buildings to collapse, blasting holes in walls, riding moving tramways, as well as other ways to interact with the environment.Continued Development by FansThe High Resolution Pack for Duke Nukem 3D.The source code for Duke Nukem 3D v1.5 was released as open-source on April 1st 2003, and fans quickly begun porting the game to different operating systems. As of 2010, the game supports online multiplayer and several 3D engines exist which allow the game to be enjoyed by fans with newer, higher quality graphics - the most popular being EDuke32. To further enhance the visual quality of the game, a community project is creating high-resolution textures and 3D models for the game.EDuke32 - Windows/Linux/Mac OSX port.High Resolution Pack - New textures and 3D models.[CR]Expansions[CR]In the wake of Duke Nukem 3D's success, the game received four expansion packs:Plutonium Pak was the first expansion pack for Duke Nukem 3D and the only one created by 3D Realms themselves. The expansion added the 4th episode "The Birth" consisting of 11 new levels, and introduced a new weapon (the Microwave Expander), two new types of enemies, and a new boss. The Plutonium Pak upgrades Duke Nukem 3D from version 1.13d to version 1.4 which is dubbed "The Atomic Edition".Duke it out in D.C. was developed by Sunstorm Interactive and was the first expansion pack not developed by 3D Realms. This expansion adds a new episode, in which Duke Nukem heads to the white house to save President Clinton. This expansion did not alter any of the enemy types or weapons.Duke: Nuclear Winter was developed by Simply Silly Software with permission from 3D Realms. The expansion added a new episode in which Duke Nukem heads to the North Pole to kill an alien-controlled Santa Claus. The expansion adds new enemies, such as snowmen and elves, and new music.Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach was the second expansion developed by Sunstorm Interactive and the last official expansion for Duke Nukem 3D. The expansion adds a new Caribbean-themed episode with areas like hotels, swimming pools, and beaches. Furthermore, the expansion altered the visual appearance of every weapon and enemy.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The enemy roster of Duke Nukem 3D consists primarily of different types of aliens with aid from mechanical/robotic machinery. The enemies are shown as 2D sprites in-game due to the limitation of the Build Engine, which mean they appear as flat and paper-like. In the Nintendo 64 version, the last boss (the Cycloid Emperor) was remade as a fully 3D polygonal model. The enemies are listed in order of appearance.Standard EnemiesThe standard enemies populate the levels of Duke Nukem 3D. Six enemies are introduced in the game's first episode, five in the second, one in the third, and two in the fourth.Assault TrooperOne of the weakest and most common enemies in the game. The assault troopers often appear in groups and have the ability to use a jet-pack to attack the player from different altitudes, but their low amount of HP prevents them from becoming a serious threat to the player; a single shotgun blast, or a few pistol rounds, is enough to kill it. Despite using alien laser guns for their attacks, they may drop Pistol ammo upon death for the player to pick up.Assault CaptainAn upgraded version of the assault trooper. They have the same amount of HP as the Assault Trooper, but instead of having the ability to use a jet-pack, they can teleport. Upon using the teleportation skill, the Assault Captain will disappear for a few seconds, only to appear again - usually behind the player if possible. Just like the assault troopers, the assault captains may drop pistol ammo upon death despite using alien laser guns for their attacks.Pig CopThe pig cop is, together with the assault trooper and the assault captain, one of the most commonly encountered enemies in the game. They are depicted as pig-mutated members of the police force. They are armed with shotguns which makes them a serious threat for the player at close quarters. They are twice as tough as the assault trooper and captain, and require two shotgun blasts to kill. May drop a shotgun or a used body armor upon death.TurretThe damage of this rarely-encountered enemy is low, but they're often placed in hard-to-reach spots, which makes them dangerous to an unaware player. Due to their small size, they are hard to hit with conventional firearms without getting too close. The players best bet is to use explosive weaponry.Recon Patrol VehicleAlthough encountered in one of the first levels of Duke Nukem 3D, this enemy is one of the rarest in the game. Their damage is the same as a turret, but they are much tougher and can take a high amount of damage before the vehicle crashes to the ground. From the exploding wreckage, a pig cop pilot will emerge and continue to attack the player just like a regular pig cop.OctabrainThese eight-brained monsters will attack the player by shooting plasma matter towards the player. They will even bite the player if he gets too close. Their plasma attack travels slowly through the air and are easy for the player to dodge. The octabrains have no legs and are floating slowly though the air instead. Their head is covered with thick skin and are one of the toughest standard enemies in the game in terms of amount of hit points.Assault EnforcerThis enemy type is first encountered in the game's second episode, "Lunar Apocalypse". Assault enforcers are agile lizard-like aliens that are able to jump, which make them able to traverse ledges. They use a chaingun as their primary form of attack and will occasionally spit acid at the player, which will both deals damage and obscures the vision for a short amount of time. The assault enforcers are about as tough as the pig cops and may drop ammunition for the ripper chaingun, or even the weapon itself, upon death.Sentry DroneThis enemy type is a slow-moving aerial bomb. Once they sense the player is in proximity, they will emit a distinctive sound and head right towards him. When the sentry drone reaches the player, it will self-destruct and deal a high amount of damage. The sentry drones should therefore be a target of high priority for the player in any given battle. The sentry drones are quite tough and can take a lot of damage before exploding. Whenever a sentry drone is hit by the player, they will slow down noticeable which allows for the player to keep them at bay.Protozoid Egg &amp; SlimerThe protozoid eggs aren't a threat to the player until they hatch. They usually hatch when the player comes within a certain range of them and unleash a protozoid slimer. The slimers are slow-moving, but they are able to crawl on ceilings as well as the floor and are able to quickly transition from one surface to the other. When they reach the player, they will block the screen and attacking with a low-damage bite. The slimers are very weak and die instantly from any damage source, and they often appear in high numbers.Assault CommanderThe Assault Commander is one of the toughest types of enemies in the game. It has a high amount of HP and he fires missiles towards the player as his primary attack. The missiles are somewhat slow-moving, but they deal a high amount of damage in a large radius on impact. If the player moves into melee distance of an Assault Commander, it will start spinning its blade-equipped platform and damaging the player. Assault Commanders are an aerial enemy and can follow the player anywhere. Once the Assault Commander has spotted the player, it can be heard making grunt noises and the occasional taunt "Suck it down!" and "Die, human!"SharkThe only enemy in the game from Earth. Sharks are rarely encountered throughout the game, as they can only appear in pools of water. Their only attack is a melee attack and even in water they are very slow-moving. Sharks have a low amount of hit points, which makes them one of the easiest enemies to kill in Duke Nukem 3D.Protector DroneAdded in the Plutonium Pak.The toughest standard enemy the player will encounter in the entire game. Protector drones have a high amount of hit points, are fast-moving, and deals a lot of damage. They primarily use their melee attack, but occasionally they will shoot a Shrink-ray projectile towards the player. This projectile has the same effect as the shrink ray weapon the player possesses, which mean the player will become shrunk if he gets hit by the projectile. Should this happen, every enemy in will attempt to step on and squish the player, which results in an instant death. As protector drones were added to Duke Nukem 3D in the Plutonium Pak, they only appear in the fourth episode.Pig Cop TankAdded in the Plutonium Pak.A pig cop driving a single-seated riot tank. Just like the recon patrol vehicle, a pig cop will appear and fight on when the vehicle gets destroyed. The pig cop tank are slow-moving, slow-turning, deals a moderate amount of damage, and have a very high amount of hit points. They do, however, have a weak spot on their back. This, combined with their slow turning speed, allows the player to circle around them and attack them from behind. As pig cop tanks were added to Duke Nukem 3D in the Plutonium Pak, they only appear in the fourth episode.Boss EnemiesAt the end of each episode, the player will have to fight a boss-type enemy. These boss fights often take place in arena-like surroundings with lots of weaponry and ammunition for the player to pick up.BattlelordThe Battlelord is first seen at the end of episode 1 and his death marks the end of said episode. He is wielding a huge chaingun with an attached grenade launcher, which makes him very dangerous to the player. Being a boss-type enemy, the Battlelord has a very high amount of hit points. This, combined with the high damage output, forces the player into a battle of resources, where he continuously have to collect health items and ammunition to ensure the boss drops dead before the player himself.As with all bosses, actually touching the massive beast results in instantaneous death. In the later episodes, Duke will encounter Mini-Battlelords, which are visually identical, lesser versions of the Battlelord with less health and without the ability to crush Duke on contact. The Mini-Battlelords are the the toughest non-boss enemies.OverlordThe Overlord is the leader of the alien invasion force stationed on the moon, and is the last boss of the second episode in Duke Nukem 3D. He has a huge fast-firing dual rocket launcher attached to his back, which is his only way of attacking the player. Although the Overlord constantly barrages the player with incoming missiles, the Overlord is proclaimed to be the easiest boss in the game, since his attacks can be avoided by simply circle-strafing around him.Like other bosses, he has a large amount of hit points, high damage output, and can instantaneously kill the player if he gets too close. Unlike the Battlelord, the Overlord only appears once in Duke Nukem 3D. He did, however, appear in a weaker state on some levels in the Nintendo 64 version. The Overlord's real claim to fame was when Duke Nukem threatened him with: "I'm gonna rip off your head and shit down your neck.", a threat he carried out in the end-of-episode cutscene.Cycloid EmperorThe final and most powerful boss of the original three episodes of Duke Nukem 3D. The Cycloid Emperor is the leader of the alien force, and the final battle takes place on en American football stadium. When attacking he uses one of his robotic arms to rapidly fire missiles towards the player. The Cycloid Emperor's missiles are moving faster than the Overlord's, which makes them harder for the player to avoid. Similar to the primary attack of the octabrains, the Cycloid Emperor is able to shoot plasma matter at the player through his mouth. Like the other end-of episode bosses before him, the Cycloid Emperor can instantly kill the player if the player gets too close.After the Cycloid Empreror dies, a cutscene is shown. The cutscene features Duke Nukem kicking the back of the Cycloid Emperor's head so hard that his eye rockets out and sails between the uprights, causing Duke to throw his arms up in the traditional touchdown-gesture and triumphantly shout "Game over!".Alien QueenAdded in the Plutonium Pak.The final boss of the episode added in the Plutonium Pak. The Alien Queen is the mother of all Protector Drones (the new alien threat), and it is Duke Nukem's goal of the episode to kill her. The final battle takes place under water in an alien cave-like environment, and the Alien Queen will occasionally give birth to additional Protector Drones throughout the fight. She has a lightning attack with a large range, and the player will die instantaneously if he gets too close.Since the player will have to deal with the additional protector drones, the Alien Queen herself does not have that many hit points compared to the other bosses, but the situation is still a challenge to the player. Not only does he have to kill the Alien Queen, he is also required to take care of the Protector Drones and make sure he doesn't run out of air.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Mighty BootCan be used when Duke's either out of ammo. Duke Nukem is able to kick alien monsters in the face, while he's shooting them at the same time. Truly the ultimate alien ass kicker. Since this is the unarmed weapon of the game, the damage is rather low. The quick kick (which can be immediately triggered no matter what weapon is currently in-hand), however, is a nice addition to damage whenever an enemy is up close.PistolThe most basic weapon in the game. Whenever Duke's low on ammo, or simply want to save the powerful weapons for a better time, don't hesitate to use the pistol. Its damage is low, it is fast-firing and accurate, making it a reliable all-around weapon.ShotgunThe shotgun is generally considered the "workhorse" of the game, doing most of the hard work. The damage is - like any shotgun - great up close, but rather dull at longer distances. It's able to kill most enemies in the game with one or two direct hits, and ammo is plentiful.Ripper ChaingunThe Ripper, like the pistol is a rapid-fire bullet weapon. It does more damage and fires faster than the pistol, but has reduced accuracy and scarcer ammo. Most enemies will no fare well against the Ripper, their health rapid depleting. Weaker enemies are eviscerated almost instantly.RPGThis unbelievably powerful weapon is a danger to everyone - including Duke. One misfired rocket into a wall, and he's dead. It's often a good idea to save the ammo for very hard encounters (e.g. boss fights).Pipe BombThe pipe bomb is the grenade of Duke Nukem 3D. When tossed, Duke pulls out a remote detonator, and upon pressing the fire button again, blows up the pipe bomb. The explosive damage of the pipe bombs are massive. Players are able to pick up a thrown pipe bomb to cancel out of the detonation prompt. Pipe bombs can also be detonated by being shot, and players who have thrown a pipe bomb can press the 6 button again to bring up another pipe bomb without detonating the first one. Upon hitting the big red detonator, all pipe bombs the player has placed will simultaneously explode. This can be used to set large clusters of pipe bombs as a trap for aliens or unsuspecting players.Shrink RayThe Shrink Ray is a unique weapon, and is an iconic weapon in the Duke Nukem franchise. It does exactly what it says on the box - shrinks enemies to the size of an action figure. After doing this, the player can run up to the victim and stomp him into goo. When he's the victim of the shrink ray, Duke moves extra fast and are unable to attack. He can, however, still use items (medkit, holoduke etc.), while fleeing the feet of his enemies. There are certain points in the game where Duke himself must be shrunk in order to get through small areas. There is a time limit when Duke is shrunk and if he is in a place too small for normal Duke, he will die upon expanding back to normal size.DevastatorThe devastator is a double-barrelled fully automatic rocket launcher able to clear a room of enemies in seconds. Its firing rate is quick, and though its ordinance does less damage than the RPG, it has a higher DPS. However, the ammo for this weapon is relatively scarce.Laser TripbombThe laser trip mines are mines that are placed on any wall by the player, creating a beam that extends to the other side of the wall. When an enemy crosses the beam, the laser mine explodes. Valve had their own version of the laser trip mine in Half-Life, but it was practically identical. In practice, the laser trip mine was of limited usefulness, as the explosion was only the size and strength of an RPG blast, and it only came from the mine itself. In the single-player mode, it was only ever deployed in areas where the explosion would hurt or kill Duke, but in multiplayer, it could easily be placed on a open area where a player could set it off far enough away from the mine that they take no damage.FreezethrowerThe freezethrower is an automatic weapon that fires ice crystals, which freeze victims solid. When frozen, any sort of damage will instantly kill them. When walking up to a frozen enemy, Duke will automatically shatter them with a kick. In addition, the ice crystals ricochet off walls, giving them the tactical ability to be shot bounced around corners as well as the danger of self freezing. The freezethrower's ice crystals will only hurt a victim until they reach 1 HP, at which point they will be frozen. Players can save ammo by hurting them with regular weapons before using the freezethrower to finish them off, or use the freezethrower to weaken the enemy to the point of becoming frozen, then shooting the enemy to shatter and kill it.Microwave ExpanderAdded in the Plutonium Pak.The new microwave expander weapon looks a lot like the Shrinker from the original game, but instead of a green glowing crystal it's equipped with a red crystal and a small satellite. Compared to the shrinker from the original game, the expander does the exact opposite: expands enemies until their bodies burst. The burst even deals damage to nearby enemies, making the Expander one of the coolest and funniest weapons in the Duke Nukem arsenal.[CR]Episodes &amp; Levels[CR]Duke Nukem 3D and Plutonium Pak level designers:AB - Allen H. Blum IIILL - Richard Bailey Grey (also known as the 'Level Lord')RP - Randy PitchfordKS - Keith SchulerGB - George BroussardSince the game followed the famous shareware-model, the game was released in episodes. Duke Nukem 3D consisted of three episodes at the time of release: L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Scrapnel City. A fourth episode, The Birth, was later added to the game in the Plutonium Pak. Following is a list of the game's four episodes with included designer credit:Episode 1: L.A.

Entered from Pigsty)[CR]Ports &amp; other Versions[CR]Nintendo 64Duke Nukem 64Duke Nukem 64 is a port of Duke Nukem 3D for the Nintendo 64 by Eurocom. Released on October 31, 1997, Duke Nukem 64 featured a number of major and minor changes to the game to make it more suitable for its new platform and audience. Some of these changes were superficial censorship edits to fit better with Nintendo's family-friendly policies while others were governed by the technical limitations of the platform.Some of the most obvious alterations to the game are the removal of Duke Nukem 3D's more controversial elements. All women have been given additional layers of clothing, strippers won't actually strip, Duke never uses profanity or makes lewd comments, steroids have been renamed to "Vitamin X", and pornography on TV and movie screens have been replaced with alternate content. Some mature locations were replaced, such as the pornography store being replaced by a gun store and a strip club being replaced by a warehouse. Captive women in alien pods were left in the game (though with more 'pod' added to better cover their nudity) and, instead of killing them, Duke saves them by "teleporting" them - this counts towards a new end level goal.Some of the sexual references were replaced in this version. The new engine for the Nintendo 64 includes new elements not seen in any other version at the cost of technical limitations. The game is no longer played in episodes, just as one long sequence of levels. Some aliens and levels along with the new weapon from the Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D have been added. Most of the maps have received a large number of modifications to them. (Such as a new area in the Red Light District level) Most of the graphics for the weapons and the enemies have been replaced. Some polygonal 3D effects have been added, such as advanced explosion and smoke effects. However, skyboxes are simple one color textures and mirror effects were not implemented. Music was completely removed from the game, with the exception of the memorable title theme.The game also adds local multiplayer via splitscreen for up to four players on dukematch and two players on co-operative, along with the addition of bots. Three of the weapons from the original game are replaced (dual-wielded SMGs replace the ripper chaingun cannon, a grenade launcher replaces the RPG, a plasma cannon replaces the freezethrower, and a missile launcher replacing the devastator). Some weapons have alternate ammo, such as the missile launcher gaining heat seeking missiles, the handgun firing powerful dum-dum rounds, and the shotgun firing explosive shells.Sega SaturnDuke Nukem 3D for the Sega Saturn.Duke Nukem 3D for the Sega Saturn was developed by Lobotomy Software and published in 1997 by Sega (the last game under its Deep Water label for adult games). It featured a unique in-house engine, dubbed SlaveDriver, previously used in the Sega Saturn port of PowerSlave. The engine allowed enhanced lighting effects and a unique viewpoint tilt while turning and strafing, at the cost of "level splitting" (where Toxic Dump, Fusion Station, Dark Side, The Abyss, and Overlord are split into two levels) and no moving sectors (such as the train cars in Rabid Transit). The game also featured online multiplayer via the Sega NetLink accessory for up to two players in DukeMatch or Co-operative.The game, like the Nintendo 64 version, is no longer played in episode, just as one long sequence of levels. The player can no longer save at any point during the gameplay, only after a level has been completed. The game also features a new secret joke level, named Urea 51, which is reached from Fahrenheit. All of the remastered music were arranged by Scott Branston.Also featured in the Sega Saturn version is a hidden game, named Death Tank Zwei. It is the sequel to the hidden bonus game, Death Tank, from the Saturn version of PowerSlave and the predecessor to Death Tank for the Xbox Live Arcade. The game was accessed either by playing through the main game, smashing every single toilet in the game, or by having save data from the Sega Saturn port of Quake. The game is a 2D multiplayer real-time tank shooter similar to Scorched Earth, supporting up to seven players at a time. A limited version of Death Tank Zwei was included in Death Tank for the Xbox Live Arcade.PlayStationDuke Nukem: Total Meltdown.Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown (also known simply as "Duke Nukem" in Europe) is a direct port of Duke Nukem 3D for the PlayStation released in September 30, 1997 (for the U.S.). It contains the original three episodes along with an additional unique episode called "Plug and Pray", which added six new levels (complete with new music, graphics, and enemies) parodying games at the time (like Wipeout and Resident Evil). All the new enemies are variants of older enemies, such as blue-colored Assault Troopers, underwater Sentry Drones, and variants of Pig Cops. The episode also contains a new end boss (CyberKeef, who is similar to the Battlelord) All of the original music was remastered by Mark Knight.The Plug and Pray episode consists of:Level 1: Nightmare ZoneLevel 2: Trackside TragedyLevel 3: Gates MotelLevel 4: Duke RoyaleLevel 5: Alien RendezvousLevel 6: Ministry of FearSecret Level: Faces of Death (reached from Alien Rendezvous) (can be found in Duke Nukem 3D with cheats or multiplayer)Game.comDuke Nukem 3D for Game.comDuke Nukem 3D for the Game.com, developed by Tiger Electronics and released on January 1, 1997, is a loose adaptation of the PC game and is the first portable Duke Nukem game ever released. Due to the limitations of the platform, it was significantly altered from the PC version. Player movement was degenerated to the point of walking forwards and backwards and strafing left and right. By pressing either B or C, players could briefly turn left and right to shoot, but there was no way to permanently turn to face in another direction. The game engine was primitive, with orthogonal walls, only 4 weapons (Boot, Pistol, Shotgun, and RPG), only 4 enemies (assault troopers, pig cops, enforcers, and octobrains), and no items except for keycards, armor, and a health kit. The game came with 12 levels that were either completely linear or had a point that loops around the level, due to the control limitations.Mega DriveDuke Nukem 3D for the Mega DriveDuke Nukem 3D for the Sega Mega Drive is an obscure port that was developed and released by Tec Toy in 1998 in Brazil only. The game engine was drastically simplified to conform to the console's hardware, and came with 9 levels that were loose adaptations of the "Lunar Apocalypse" episode.Xbox Live ArcadeDuke Nukem 3D for XBLADuke Nukem 3D was released for the Xbox 360 over Xbox Live Arcade on September 24th, 2008 for 800 Microsoft Points ($10). The game is a direct port of the Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D, adding new features such as automatically recording and saving game demos (and uploading a size-limited demo for Xbox Live friends to watch) and a new "rewind" ability, which allows Duke to respawn at any previous time point. Unfortunately, the game offers no local multiplayer, but allows Co-operative or Dukematch on Xbox Live for up to 8 players.The game features 12 achievements worth 200 gamerscore, with only 3 of those achievements requiring Dukematch play over Xbox Live. The game also features 2 unlockable gamerpics, one for loading the game (a portrait of Duke Nukem smirking) and one for unlocking all achievements (the biohazard symbol).On September 29th, 2008, VGChartz announced that Duke Nukem 3D had sold 40,000 units in 1 week -- making it the first game to beat Castle Crashers, which sold 19,000 units in its first week.iPhoneThis port features the three main episodes of the original Duke Nukem 3D. This version suffers from technical issues and doesn't include the in-game music. The framerate drops low when there are several enemies on screen, or even just several moving objects (in Episode 1 Mission 3, for example, the moving gears on the way to the blue key card slow it down), and mirrors slow it down as well (though there is an option to turn this off). The game is controlled using two touch-sensitive areas in each side of the screen. It can be switched to analog thumbsticks or digital touch areas, where one side of the screen is movement and the other is for aiming. Both have their ups and downs, but if the player can get used to the analog controls, they may be a better option.Duke Nukem 3D: ReloadedA fan project to remake the entirety of Duke Nukem 3D using the Unreal Engine 3. Green-lighted by Gearbox Software (the current owners of the Duke Nukem IP,) Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded aims to use current technology to faithfully recreate the original game. Although it is unknown how long the project will take, multiple renders and concept art is available on the site, as well as updates from the team responsible for the task.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The soundtrack was composed by Lee Jackson and Robert Prince (a.k.a Bobby Prince). Both were previously employed at id Software; working on such titles as Wolfenstein 3D, Commander Keen and Doom &amp; Doom II.There are a total of 42 tracks found in the game's files. Each level has it's own track, and so does the title screen, the opening cinematic for The Birth, and the multiplayer-only level 'Episode 1, Level 7'. The midi files themselves use the EMIDI format, designed by Lee Jackson and Jim Dose.NoTrack NameComposerLevelNotes1GrabbagLee JacksonTitle Screen / Main Menu / Main Theme2StalkerLee JacksonE1L1: Hollywood Holocaust3Taking the Death TollRobert PrinceE1L2: Red Light District4The City StreetsRobert PrinceE1L3: Death Row5Water WorldRobert PrinceE1L4: Toxic Dump6Sneaky SnakeRobert PrinceE1L5: The Abyss7The Call of DeathRobert PrinceE1L6: Launch FacilitySecret level8Ah, Geez!Lee JacksonE1L7: Faces of DeathDukematch-only level9Future Military ConquestsLee JacksonE2L1: Spaceport10Space StormRobert PrinceE2L2: Incubator11Gut WrencherRobert PrinceE2L3: Warp Factor12RoboCreepingLee JacksonE2L4: Fusion Station13Stalag 3-DLee JacksonE2L5: Occupied Territory14Pissed!Robert PrinceE2L6: Tiberius Station15Aliens, Say Your Prayers!Robert PrinceE2L7: Lunar Reactor16PlasmaLee JacksonE2L8: Dark Side17Alfred H.

		<title_clean>Earthworm Jim 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 2 takes place right after the first game with our favorite worm hero, Earthworm Jim! He is once again caught up in another adventure as his old foe, Psycrow has taken interest in Jim's love interest, Princess What's Her Name. It's up to Jim to stop his enemies yet again in order to save his love, or in any other case, become the hero and save the day (again). But this time, Jim is not alone as his best friend Snot (a booger) joins him on his quest by making Jim stick to certain parts of any level and swing him into action. Along with his trusty Plasma Gun and a new Manta Shield, Jim must traverse into strange new levels and stop Psycrow before it's too late![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 2 has the same basic controls as the first game but with a few extra features added in. One of the first few things is that Jim does have a new friend called Snot and he can use him as a grapple like hook to get to some extra parts of the level. But in order to use Snot, make sure to find green spots on top of certain areas in the level. Replacing Jim's copter from the last game, Jim can use Snot to float down to other areas in order to catch himself.There is also some added items for Jim to collect and other weapons in this game. Jim can now collect Can O' Worms this time around by going into hidden areas in the level as well as collect health that goes up to 200%. Also as an added bonus, Jim can now collect Flags so that if you do collect all three flags in a given level, you unlock a password so that you can enter the level again.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]With the age of technology upon us, Jim now must travel to new, strange and often times, creepy, levels in order to get to Psycrow and save his love. But Jim must face many dangers in his path of justice and a hero has to start somewhere in the game and nowhere involves the beginning of any game then with pigs.Anything but TangerinesThe start of Jim's crazy adventure begins in a distant planet of some kind where he encounters one of his foes, Bob the Goldfish and Number 4, his trusty cat friend with muscles the size of a few planets. Jim must use pigs in this level in order to bypass the many traps and falling grandmas in order to face Bob and defeat him in an epic battle of wits (or in this case, Bon's wits vs. Jim's small I.Q.).Lorenzo's Soil/Lorenzen's SoilDepending on what version of EWJ 2 you have, you might get a different name for this level in the game. Jim is deep underground and has a drill laser gun with unlimited ammo to get out of the dirt. However, he must collect clocks in order to stay alive. By the time you reach the end of this crazy place, Jim must face Pedro Pupa, a larvae on a unicycle in order to move on on his journey.Puppy Love Parts I, II and IIIThroughout the game, Jim must stop and ponder what he has to do in life but Psycrow has other plans by kidnapping the nephew's of Peter Puppy, Jim's best friend with anger management issues like no other. Using a giant marshmallow (where he found it, I don't know) and bounce the puppies back into Peter's home. Psycrow will throw in a bomb in there as well so make sure Jim can manage to get it to Peter. But don't drop any puppies, you really don't want to see Peter that mad and tear Jim's head of his super suit.The Villi PeopleJim's Now a Blind Cave Salamander!: As the title says, Jim has become a blind cave salamander and this level just gets the vote for making it the most interesting and weird level in an Earthworm Jim game. Just throw in a chance to be on a game show to actually get some prizes and this level has it all. Well, actually, it really does have a game show towards the end of the level and the questions are just plain weird and doesn't make any sense but hey, this is an Earthworm Jim game.The Flyin KingLooks like Major Mucus hasn't learned his lesson since he and Jim fought in the first game and now he is back and greener then ever. Jim rides his trusty rocket and must move a bomb from one side of the level to the Major himself but it is no easy task when you got ships and people coming at you. Jim must be careful for if that bomb explodes at any time, he must go back to the beginning and do it all over again.Udderly AbductedWell, as the title suggests, aliens are trying to take all the cows on the planet and it looks like Jim has to stop them. The only way for Jim to even go past a checkpoint in the game is to literally pick up one of the many cows and milk them to get the checkpoint gate open. But you can't level them for too long however cause if you do, the aliens will take them away. And to make matters worse for Jim, some cows are bombs and you must soak them with water before taking them to a checkpoint. Jim isn't getting any love around here, that's for sure.Inflated HeadLooks like our favorite evil cat has returned from Heck to bring Jim some pain. Evil the Cat runs the Carnival of Scars and will stop at nothing to defeat Jim. Jim uses the power of hot air to inflate his head to go high into the level and reach the end. Jim must dodge many neon lights and light bulbs or he will be sent down a few levels or even towards the beginning of the level again.ISO9000By the time Jim reaches this level, he really wants this adventure to end. Jim must traverse into the world of the office worker and jumping filling cabinets in order to pass the level. Jim must always go into paper shredders to progress in the level. And did i mention that towards the end, you must stop and trap a running door in order to move on in the game? Yup, nothing like that in any game you know huh?Level AteThis is by far a level most people might not want to stay forever. As the name suggests, Jim must traverse in the world of food and a never ending salt shaker floating in the air and dropping salt you. Lucky you, you run into some running snails to prevent yourself from getting hurt like crazy. But once you get to the end, you must face Flamin' Yawn on a giant pizza box. Yup, only Jim can have these kinds of adventures.See Jim Run, Run Jim RunThis is it. Jim finally made it towards the end of the game and now must face Psycrow in an epic battle of foot racing? Sure enough, a race towards the end of the level is the goal and Jim must beat Psycrow in a race in order to get the hand of the Princess. Jim must destroy many traps and hope to stay ahead from his foe or Jim's adventure might end on this dangerous trip.[CR]Game Boy Advance Version[CR]While Earthworm Jim 2 had many critics loving the game, a few scratched their heads in confusion and anger when they released the game on the Game Boy Advance/game-boy-advance/60-4/, which contained many problems from the original game. Instead of having a great game for the portable system, you get a game that wasn't even tested right and a very buggy game, many saying that it is the worst game to ever be ported in the Earthworm Jim series (and that says a lot considering how well Earthworm Jim 3D was received).[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Eiyuu Shigan - Gal Act Heroism</title_clean>
		<plot>Eiy&#363; Shigan: Gal Act Heroism differs in premise and structure from the vast majority of Japanese RPGs by focusing on non-linear questing rather than following a developed narrative. The game is set on a nameless island, which has elements of medieval fantasy as well as futuristic civilization. It allows the player to control a party of three female students from the School of Adventuring. The player can name the girls, but not change their unique battle techniques and proficiencies. The goal of the game is to reach a higher rank than the three competing teams (also containing girls only). Each team is accompanied by a guardian elf, and might also meet and/or hire other NPCs.The game has an internal schedule, which reminds the player of the other competitors and what they might have accomplished in the meantime. Game progression is non-linear: the four cities on the island can be accessed right from the beginning. Each city contains special locations where the party can choose to accept a mission. These missions can also be completed in any order; each has an approximate difficulty label. Accepting a mission usually unlocks new hostile areas, which are inaccessible otherwise. During a mission, the game plays the same way as most other Japanese RPGs: exploring the dungeon, the party finds treasure and fights enemies in turn-based combat (viewed from first-person perspective). There are no random battles: all the enemies are visibly walking on screen and can be avoided. Combat largely relies on techniques, which are grouped by classes and are unique to each girl.</plot>

		<title_clean>Enemy Zero</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Enemy Zero was the third game developed by WARP, Inc. and Kenji Eno, following the company's previous efforts D and Real Sound: The Wind's Regret. The game is influenced by and incorporates elements from the company's previous games. Enemy Zero carries over the FMV and adventure gameplay from D. Audio and sound are key to the gameplay of Enemy Zero as they were in Real Sound too.The game was released on October 31, 1997 for the Sega Saturn and November 28, 1998 for the PC.[CR]Development[CR]The game first began to be developed on the Sony Playstation, but due to poor sales of D on that platform, the game's development was moved over to the Sega Saturn. Kenji Eno has stated in interviews that he was so upset with Sony about the poor sales of D on the Playstation, that he would no longer develop games for Sony platforms. Eno also stated that orders for D on Playstation existed and were not met because Sony chose not to have enough copies of the game manufactured. Some critics questioned the move from the Playstation to the Sega Saturn platform, stating that the Saturn could not handle the 3d polygonal graphics needed for the first person perspective in the game. Eno stated in an interview with 1up.com that the move from the Playstation to the Saturn was not that difficult and the platforms are similar.Enemy Zero was powerfully influenced by the previous WARP, Inc. games D and Real Sound. E0 was a Full Motion Video (FMV) game similar to D, and also greatly relied upon sound as influenced by Real Sound.The game's storyline involved the player's character, Laura awakening from a cryogenic sleep aboard the spaceship the AKI. Laura is awakened due to an emergency on the AKI. Laura witnesses one of her companions get torn apart and killed by an unseen enemy. Then the player must search the AKI to destroy enemies and figure what has happened on the ship.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Laura in Enemy ZeroEnemy Zero's gameplay featured a combination of unique individual components. The game used a first person perspective for its interactive and combat portions. The player could explore the spacecraft in this first person view and also engaged in combat with the game's invisa\ible enemies in this perspective. The player could detect opponents through sound. Sound and audible cues clued the player to enemies location. Different pitches and volumes of sound would further assist the player to succinctly understand the distance and direction of enemies. Shooting enemies with guns found in the game was made more difficult because guns had to be charged up a particular amount or they would lose their charge and the player would be unable to fire at enemies. All guns in the game also only had a particular range, so timing of firing at the invisible enemies had to be especially well timed due to the combination of charging up and ranged firing. The game's first person perspective and limitations in firing was considered extraordinarily challenging and difficult for the time, 1997, and for the Japanese market.Secondly, the game used an interactive FMV mode very similar to the previous WARP game D. Portions of the game were no longer in first person perspective and the palyer moved the Laura character around the AKI space ship to find clues about what happened on the ship.The game had three difficulty levels at the beginning; Beginner, Easy and Normal. Upon completing a game in the Normal mode, the game would open up Hard mode. Hard mode in the game would not only be more difficult with a limited amount of saves and ammo, but would also add an additional FMV movie, a shower scene.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Enemy Zero Original SoundtrackThe soundtrack to Enemy Zero was composed by Michael Nyman, a famous British minimalist composer, who has composed for films such as Gattaca and The Piano. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and distributed by Pony Canyon on April 18, 1997.Eno was a big fan of Nyman and thought the juxtaposition between the game's setting and Nyman's musical style would be a great match for his game. At the time, Nyman was visiting Japan after donating pianos to schools after the Kobe earthquake in 1995. Eno managed to find him and invite him back to his hotel room where he spent six hours convincing him to compose the score until Nyman eventually agreed, exhausted. Eno was initially unimpressed with the work Nyman was doing and traveled to Abbey Road several times during the recording of the score.Enemy Zero Original SoundtrackTotal length: 49:48Laura's ThemeConfusionAspects of LoveDigital TragedyEnemy ZeroLamentationLove ThemeDigital ComplexInvisible EnemyLaura's ThemeAgonyMalfunctionBattleThe Last Movement[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The main character of the game, Laura Lewis, was a character model or virtual actress that Eno used on a recurring basis. Eno used the "Laura" character in D, Enemy Zero and D2. The character was named Laura Harris in D.The Enemy Zero Limited Edition crateEnemy Zero had perhaps the most expensive and exclusive limited edition version of a video game ever. The limited edition version of the game had only twenty copies. Twenty crates which contained all of the limited edition materials were produced. The limited edition of the game included a T-Shirt, a VHS tape with music clips from the game, a replica of the game's gun, actual design documents used in the game, a full outfit as worn by companion girls at WARP's 1996 Tokyo Game Show booth and various other paraphernalia. At the time, the limited edition version of Enemy Zero cost 200,000 yen each, that is approximately $2500 US dollars. Kenji Eno personally delivered the crates to each buyer himself on a truck.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.[CR]There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.[CR]The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system[CR]FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</plot>

		<plot>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.  [CR]In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.  Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.[CR]Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.[CR]One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.[CR]This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.</plot>

		<plot>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.[CR]While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.[CR]Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.[CR]Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.</plot>

		<plot>A vertically scrolling shoot 'em up released in 1993 focusing on air to air and air to ground combat. The game play takes place on two planes, an upper plane and a lower plane. With the difference between the planes being your method of attack. The upper plane requiring you to use your standard shot type weapon to dispose of enemies, and the lower requiring you to use your lock on laser type weapon for previously mentioned enemy disposal. The number of enemies you can lock on to with the laser type weapon is dictated by the number of laser power ups you have collected.Boss fights will generally require you to use both of your attack types and require experimentation to determine where each attack type is required to down the enemy.Galactic Attack features a limited continue system allowing you only four credits at the outset of the game. You can double the amount of credits available to you by entering a cheat code at the title select screen.The game features TATE mode allowing you to rotate your monitor 90 degrees for full screen action if you are so equipped with such a setup. It also has an option to remove the onscreen HUD by pressing the Left shoulder button allowing you full view of the action with no score counters and such to impede your viewThe game contains seven levels, they are as follows:Round 1- Red Power to Pierce ThroughRound 2- The Gravity of Blue SideRound 3- The Phantasm of SilverRound 4- The Fissure of ConsciousnessRound 5- Toward the DarknessRound 6- The End of Deep LayerFinal round- Releasing Infinitely[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Gals Panic SS is the first game in the Gals Panic series designed specifically for home consoles. That said, there is no nudity. It is very similar to Gals Panic 4 before it in that all the girls are drawn in an anime style, with no photographic models whatsoever. The gameplay is changed in this game. The same basic gameplay of uncovering a girl's picture with Qix-like gameplay is used, but you spend 5 rounds on each girl. After this, instead of moving on to the next girl, the game saves and ends. You then play another girl after starting the game again. There is a gallery where the unlocked CG can be viewed. There are a total 12 models in the game, the last two unlocked after beating all the available girls. Some of these girls are reused from Gals Panic 4.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gex is a 2-D mascot platformer developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by BMG Interactive Entertainment for the Panasonic 3D0 in 1995. At one point a pack-in game for the ill-fated system, It was later ported to the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC, and spawned two 3-D based sequels for the Playstation and Nintendo 64.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Gex (voiced by comedian Dana Gould) is an anthropomorphic teenage gecko living in Hawaii with his mother and siblings. When his father, a NASA employee, is killed in a space shuttle accident, Gex becomes a shut-in, refusing to do nothing except watch television for hours on end in an attempt to refuse coping with his father's sudden and untimely death. After trying everything in her power to get her son out of the house and away from the television, Gex's mother decides to move the whole family to California.A change of scenery does nothing for Gex, however, and, after a few attempts by both his new neighbors and his family to get him away from the television, Gex's mom gets desperate and gives the TV away to gypsies. Gex soon runs away from home in outrage and befriends some local punk kids, one of which allows Gex to sleep in his garage.Months pass and Gex's mental state deteriorates to the point where he considers an imaginary figure called "The Mayor" as his best friend. While skateboarding with "The Mayor" one day, Gex encounters a black limo, which, come to find out, is now owned by his mother. Another death in the family (this time an uncle, who is noted as being the original model for the Izod clothing company logo) has caused Gex's family to obtain a huge inheritance. Gex uses his share of the funds to move back to Maui, where he buys a mansion, a big-screen TV, and an obscene amount of food so he will never have to leave his house.Of course, this being a 2-D platforming game, something bad is bound to happen that will cause the hero to go on some sort of ridiculous journey, and Gex winds up getting sucked into his new TV thanks to the villainous Rez, who plans on using our brave reptilian hero as the mascot for his hellish Media Dimension, an alternate universe where television fantasy becomes an antagonistic reality.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Gex is your typical mid-90's mascot platforming title. Players must avoid obstacles, collect television remotes, and fight enemies in order to get to the end of the stage. Levels are connected by hub worlds, each with its own television-related theme, and occasional boss battles liven things up every now and then. Gex's main mode of attack was a tail whip, and he could obtain power-ups that let him, among other things, breathe fire and frost-based attacks.[CR]Development[CR]Gex was Crystal Dynamic's attempt to cash in on the anthropomorphic mascot craze of the 90s. Development started with a 5 person team in 1993 as a game about a stunt-gecko named "Gecko X". Each level was themed around a different action move genre and began showing stock footage of a film from the genre. "Gecko X" then had to explore the environment completing stunt tricks in order to obtain money.After a test level was completed using this early concept Lead Programmer "G-Man" expressed discontent with the game's direction and suggested a move to the game's final, more fantasy-themed direction. The character of "Gecko X" was redesigned into his current incarnation as "Gex" and a new villain, "Rez", was created as well. The stunt-gecko idea was also dropped.The team began working on art assets for the game but, due to the power of the 32-bit Panasonic 3DO when compared to the 16-bit consoles the devs had been working on up to that point, development moved slowly for the Gex team. Crystal Dynamics's initial reluctance to add more employees to the team did not help the slow dev process, and it looked unlikely that the game would be ready for its original release date of June 1994. The company eventually hired more artists, however, and even contracted out some of the graphical to work to Silicon Knights, who later became famous for Eternal Darkness for the Nintendo GameCube.June 1994 came and the game was only about halfway done. Levels were either completely redone with tile sets they weren't originally intended to use, or, in the case of a science-fiction themed world, scrapped entirely. Crystal Dynamics hired more employees to help finish the game, but Gex still needed a ton of work in order to stand out amongst the many other mascot platformers that had begun to flood the gaming market. Members of the development team worked 12-16 hour days, hoping to finish the game by Summer 1995. To kill off stress the tile set for the sci-fi levels was resurrected for hidden levels and two secret mini-games were added to the game's code. An 18 minute credit sequence was also created for the game, accessible by beating the hidden sci-fi levels.When the game was almost finished, play testers found a hidden level created by lead designer Justin Knorr that contained the message "Didn't you think this level had some cool shit in it? This level was cut because the company didn't put you, the customer, first but just wanted to make money. Call Madeline Canepa at 415-555-1212 and give her a piece of your mind and my mind too". The level was cut and Knorr was fired from the company.The game was originally slated to feature rail-shooter-esque levels in addition to the platforming segments, but these were later scrapped.[CR]Ports[CR]With the 3DO performing miserably in the gaming marketplace, Gex wound up being ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn shortly after its original release. The port was published by Crystal Dynamics and did not feature all of the secrets found in the 3DO version. In addition, the 3DO's save game feature was eliminated and passwords, considered a relic of the 16-bit era, were the only way players could continue the game at a later point without losing their progress.A PC port was later published by Microsoft Game Studios after the success of the game on consoles.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Gex for the 3DO soon became the premier 2-D platformer for the system. Its success spawned two sequels, Enter the Gecko and Deep Cover Gecko, for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, both later remade for the Game Boy Color. Despite its two sequels and handheld ports, however, Gex's popularity never reached as high as the Crash Bandicoot's and Spyro the Dragon's of the world. The series did not make an appearance on the last generation of consoles, and, with Crystal Dynamics busy with the Tomb Raider series this generation, it is unlikely that we'll see a new title in the series any time soon.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10Processor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 92 MB available space[CR]Links[CR] GMAN-GAMES: GEX - the game's lead programmer talks at length about the game's development[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]With unity spanning the reaches of our solar system, war seems to be a thing of the past. However, many things change when the Ghen make their presence known to humanity. Even though they did not show hostility to the humans, the people could not help but not trust the Ghen. With the discovery of Stronium, both the humans and the  The Ghen turn on humanity.Ghen worked to harness the power of this elementary material. This research and development led to the invention of the Stronium reactor, a facility able to output much more power than anyone could ever hope to achieve using the nuclear fusion process. With this abundance of energy, the Ghen and the humans saw a time of peace, prosperity, and productivity.On a routine Stronium mining operation, the Ghen make a rather stealthy exodus. The humans including you, a lieutenant surface engineer, were completely caught off guard. The Ghen leave and set out on a sinister plan to destroy the human race in order to reap the benefits of the Stronium reactor technology for their own use. You manage to escape with the rest of your crew and set out to fight the Ghen war using a powered mech hypersuit used during the mining operation.Though your crew is attempting to fight the just fight against the Ghen, the rest of Earth is not supportive of the cause and demands that the crew stops this resistance. Assuming that the Ghen have infiltrated the political reaches of Earth, you and the rest of your crew disregard the order and resume this noble crusade.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Parodius Da!, or simply Parodius, is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up from Konami that plays similarly to their Gradius series. Its full Japanese title is Parodius Da! Shinwa kara Owarai e, or "It's Parodius! From Myth to Laughter".Following the popularity of their own Gradius franchise, Konami took the basic concepts from those games, but added a healthy dose of weird to the characters, environments, and enemies. Parodius is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up at its heart. Players use their ships to blast wave after wave of enemies, collecting powerups that range from shields to missiles to, in the case of Parodius, heat-seaking octopuses.A lot of characters in the game come from various Konami franchises, as well as popular characters in Japanese culture and history. It is a very deliberate send-up of Gradius, with menu options including "One Player", "Two Player" and "Lollipop", but is a very accomplished version of the series at its heart which, despite the candy-coated visuals, zany characters and far out enemies, is a great game in its own right.This game is actually the second Parodius in the series: the first was exclusive to the Japanese home computer MSX and was named Parodius: Tako wa Chikyuu o Sukuu ("Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth").[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]While the only playable character in the Gradius series is the Vic Viper fighter, Parodius' selectable characters offer a bit more variety.TwinbeeTwinbeeA small blue plane with two big fists on the front, Twinbee is the eponymous main character in its own series of games, the second of which was ported to the US and renamed as Stinger. In its games, Twinbee's powerups were granted by shooting bells that appear on the screen. The bells also appear in Parodius, supplying the player with a limited set of power-ups that work independently from the standard weapon power-ups gained from blowing up enemy ships. Twinbee's power-ups include rocket fists, which fly across the screen and slowly return to the plane, a forwards and backwards shot, a three-way shot, shadowed out copies of Twinbee that fire and cannot be damaged, and a radial shield that offers a wide area of protection.Vic ViperVic ViperThe Vic Viper is just about the only normal thing about Parodius. Its power-ups match those found in Gradius. Included are missiles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, a laser beam, small glowing options which absorb bullets and fire when the Vic Viper fires, and a shield which blocks shots in front.TakosukeTakosukeTakosuke is a space-faring, headband-wearing octopus. He was created specifically for this game, and in a weird way fits into the game better because of it. His power-ups include missiles that fire straight up and down, a forwards and backwards shot, a wide-area ripple laser, little octopuses that follow Takosuke around and fire when he does, and a jellyfish-shaped shield.PentarouPentarouPentarou is a penguin that travels through space and shoots out of his mouth and other places. His upgrades are missiles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, an exploding shot, small penguins that travel close to Pentarou and shoot when he does, and a bubble shield.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Golden Axe - The Duel</title_clean>
		<plot>This is a one-on-one fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter 2 and Samurai Shodown featuring the cast of Sega's Golden Axe games (actually their fictional descendants).  The game's story is that Death Adder has been resurrected and stolen the legendary Golden Axe from Gilius Thunderhead's family. For some reason Death Adder decided to set up a Street Fighter-like tournament to give his enemies an opportunity to slay him and prevent the end of the world.[CR]The game play formula follows Street Fighter 2 closely with several playable characters that are essentially the same as the cast of the original Golden Axe (for all extents and purposes).[CR]Its essentially an elimination tournament with each character having special moves similar to that of Street Fighter 2 characters. You can play against another player or against the computer. It does feature scaling backgrounds similar to Samurai Shodown.</plot>

		<title_clean>Grandia</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A traditional Japanese Role-Playing Game with an unusual timing-based battle system, Grandia has spawned several sequels and ports, as well as a few spin-offs. Originally released on the Sega Saturn system, it was eventually ported to the PlayStation system. It was met well critically, but did not sell especially well. It is now remembered fondly by many RPG enthusiasts for its well-rounded and likable cast, in addition to its unique battle system and beloved music.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Grandia's story focuses on Justin, a teenage boy who aspires to become an adventurer like his father and grandfather before him. In the beginning the game focuses on Justin's father (who died years before the beginning of the story) Justin's father accomplished great things on his travels, he mostly discovered different speccies on the old continent . Hailing from a fairly small port town, known as "Parm," Justin wants nothing more than to explore new places and become the greatest adventurer in the world. Even though Justin is well liked in his hometown, most people don't take him seriously and they don't believe that he will ever become a famous adventurer, Justin however is stubborn and eventually pursues his dreams. Justin's travels begins with a visit at the local museum, at the museum the curator tells Justin about an ancient civilization, and how Justin's "spirit stone" (a gift from Justin's father) is a link to that civilization . The curator tells Justin to go to the Sult Ruins, which will give him some answers and he hand over a letter that will allow Justin to enter the ruins to learn about the "Angelo" civilization and their history. However Justin encounters the military who has made the ruins into an excavation site. Justin sneaks into the center of the ruins, where he learns something that encourages him to leave Parm and search for more information.That something is told to young Justin by Liete, a young woman who he finds in the Sult ruins. She tells Justin to start his new adventure by traveling to the New World. Justin, decides to take the boat to the New World and begin his adventure alone, afraid to tell his Mother so she won't stop him and not to have the burden to protect his young friend Sue. During his travels to the New World, Justin discovers a few things, Sue can not be stopped by being left behind. Sue is caught by the ships crew as a stowaway. After working as part of the crew so Sue would not be fed to the fishes of the ocean, the adventures meet Feena, a true adventurer. A woman with beautiful green hair and many adventurer stories. Shortly after meeting Feena, they are attacked by a Ghost ship and have to join forces with the fierce warrior in order to save their lives and the lives of the people on their ship.Once the trio arrive in New Parm, Feena offers for them to visit her at her home north of town after they have finished their business in town but she will not be able to join them, though Feena has fought ghosts and other horrible monsters, there is something more sinister and foul in the town that she doesn't dare step foot in. Justin and Sue discover why Feena avoids the town when Justin tries to apply to be an adventurer. The Adventurers society new president Pakon, is an arrogant, selfish brat who is very selective in who he lets into the society. Pakon has delusions that his love for Feena is shared by her as well and goes over the line by kidnapping her in an attempt to marry him. Justin and Sue come to Feenas rescue and stop the wedding which results in Feena losing her Adventure license and banning Justin for life. With his head held high, Justin explains to Feena that nobody tells the wind where it can go and that is what a true adventurer is. Feena, Sue and Justin leave New Parn in search of treasure, glory and adventure.The group travel North to Misty forest where they discover the Dom ruins, after avoiding death traps and monsters they reach their destination where Liete returns and explains to the party that they need to continue to travel to the end of the world for they will see that there is no such thing as the end of the world. After leaving the ruins they discover a young humanoid creature with a horn on its head and tail injured. They take the creature back to Feena's hut. Feena tells Justin that there is an herb that will help save the creatures life in the mountains. After finding the herb they create the medicine and apply it to the wounds. Knowing that they have done all that they can they go to sleep only to wake in the morning with the creature gone. They hear strange music coming from outside and find the creature playing an instrument. The creature hands them a nut to eat but before they can eat the food they are surrounded by the Garlyle Forces, the creature and the party are taken away as prisoners.At the Garlyle base after a failed escape attempt, Justin is talked to by Leen who hints that if he could escape again his best course of action would be to steal the military train. Leen walks away and drops the key inside the prison cell allowing Justin to escape once again and free his friends. Justin explains how dumb Leen was for dropping the Key and explaining how to escape. Before leaving they locate the creature and free him as well. After freeing him, he gives the nuts to the party once again. After eating the nuts they find that it allows them to communicate with "Rem" and he explains to them that he is from the village of Luc that is hidden away by Mist so that no one from the outside can find it. He left the village to see the outside world when he was attacked by the Garlyle Forces. The group escapes the facility by hijacking the military train and head for Rems Village.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Field2d sprites on a 3d polygonal worldGrandia's game world is displayed in 3D with a rotatable camera, although all characters show up as 2D sprites on the world. In this way, the game resembles some other games of its era, such as Xenogears. Although the camera did not cause very many issues generally, it occasionally would cause the player's view to be obstructed.Enemies in the game always appeared in the field. Like in most traditional RPGs of its type, touching an enemy would take the player away from the field and the characters would enter a battle screen.There is a world map in Grandia, but the player does not travel across it in the normal vein of traditional RPGs. Instead, the areas on the map are merely shown as different points which can be selected to travel to. Usually, one of the points between major towns will be a wilderness area which must be traversed by the player.Battle SystemAlthough Grandia's characters and story are generally well-liked by the series' fans, the game is most widely recognized for its battle system. Unlike the most popular timing-based RPG battle system used in the Final Fantasy games, Grandia's system placed all the characters and enemies on one bar. All characters' icons moved toward the right side of the bar. When halfway down the bar, the player would then be able to choose a command for the character. After this, there would be a short "Wait" time in which the character would prepare to attack. Upon reaching the end of the bar, the character would perform the action given to them.Aside from normal attacks (in which the character would strike twice), the player could also choose to use a Critical Attack. This would allow the player to use one attack with a chance of stunning an enemy if they were in the "Wait" position on the timing bar. The use of the timing in the battle system was what set Grandia's battle system apart. Players also have the options of Defending and using Skills or Magic. While different Skills are given to individual characters based on their weapon and Magic statistics, most Magic skills could be taught to nearly any character (although some of the strongest spells could only be acquired by certain team members).In most RPG's you level you characters up but in the Grandia universe you not only level up your character but each time you use your magic or weapons as well they will gain levels. By leveling up certain weapons and magic you can combine them to create even greater damaging abilities. An example of this would be to level up your whip with Feena once it reaches a certain level along with leveling fire, you will be able to do an attack that uses both to damage your foes.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Justin - Justin, age 14, lives with his mother Lilly in the town of Parm in the Old World.

		<plot>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.[CR]The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.[CR]The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Guardian Heroes is a 2-D side scrolling beat-em-up for the Sega Saturn, developed by Treasure and released for the Saturn in 1996. The game was re-released as an XBLA title on October 12, 2011. The re-release features updated HD visuals.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Nicole and Ginjiro face off in the arena.Unlike many other side scrolling beat-em-ups (Final Fight, Double Dragon, Streets of Rage), Guardian Heroes features three 'layers' on the playfield that players can jump between using the shoulder buttons. While in one of these layers, the player is locked into it and can only move left or right along it. This allowed players the ability to utilize 2-D fighting game movements (for instance the infamous Street Fighter Fireball motion: down, down-forward, forward, attack) that opened up a larger library of moves over other games in the genre.Guardian Heroes also features an RPG-like experience system. Players are rewarded for successful attacks with experience points, which in turn translate into higher levels and points to spend on stat increases at the end of each stage. Another important gameplay element is the undead hero, who joins the player early on in the story mode and essentially acts as a bodyguard whose behaviour can be controlled via a menu.Guardian Heroes features 2 player co-operative play as well as a 6 player arena mode where players can select any character or enemy featured in the game, once unlocked in story mode.A Sequel, Advance Guardian Heroes, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Guardian Heroes are a group of adventurers whose acquirement of a certain mythical sword makes them targets of the royal knights. After being warned of an impending ambush by an enigmatic knight named Serena, and fending off the first attack by the kingdom's military, the Guardian Heroes next course of action is decided by the player through the game's branching routes system. While there a variety of paths to follow, they all eventually lead to Kanon, the sorceror who secretly controls the kingdom.Kanon reveals some startling revelations about the history of their world, and once again the player must decide the Guardian Heroes' fate. Their choices eventually lead to either a confrontation with the Celestial beings who played a significant hand in human history, their Subteranean rivals, stopping the mechanical army created by Kanon, a surprise threat from a scheming opportunist or a last battle in the Heavens with a major rival.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Samuel HanAn ex-knight, Han is the game's obligatory warrior character. Han carries a large sword and starts with the highest attack stat in the game. He can easily be levelled up into a physical killing machine, but initially suffers from low agility and can only use a single spell. Taking a certain path in story mode will earn Han a sword which gives him a huge stat boost.Randy M. GreenRandy is an apprentice sorcerer who fights with a staff and travels with a rabbit named Nando, who fights alongside him. Randy has a wide range of spells at his disposal, but starts off with poor vitality. He has a few useful multi-hit attacks, however, and with a few stat increases he can easily hold his own in combat.Ginjirou IbushiGinjirou is a questing ninja searching for the sword Muramasa. With high agility and a good selection of thunder spells, his quick attacks and use of magic make pulling off combos very easy.Nicole NeilAs the game's cleric, Nicole is physically weak, most of her attacks being virtually useless. She makes up for this by being the only character with a healing spell, and possesses a useful barrier spell which pushes back and damages enemies. Nicole is also unique in that she is the only character whose spell selection is dictated by her LUC stat.Serena CorsairA rebel knight, Serena is only playable once the story mode has been played through once. She starts off with completely even stats and no real strengths or weaknesses allowing for easy customisation, and possesses a wide range of attacks which can become quite powerful, along with a decent selection of ice magic.[CR]Stats[CR]The stats screen in action.STR : Physical attack strength and knockback range.VIT : Total amount of HP.INT : Magical attack strength and size.MEN : Total Amount of MP and rate of recovery.AGL : Movement, physical attack and spellcasting speed.LUC : Modifies damage and defence, chance of random damage and defence bonuses. Also governs Nicole's spell selection.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Hexen is the sequel to Heretic.  While the Heretic was destroying D'Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.[CR]Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage.  Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.[CR]The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.[CR]Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game was created in December 1995 and it is a futuristic racing game consisting of racing to the finish line and at the same taking the other opponents down. The game was created using a the "Magic Carpet's" engine.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays similar to Wipeout where the vehicles must race around the tracks to become first. One way would be to race and overtake opponents, the other way would be race, overtake and shoot opponents down.The player can use the minigun and missiles to take the other players out in the open area tracks. It also introduced branching paths which led to secret shortcuts and to bigger powerups. Once is player is shot down, any powerups that the player collects, will be scattered across the track leaving the other opponents to pick them up, but can come back to compete in the race again.HUDThe HUD consists of the following:Armor - This is shown by the green bar. if this depletes, the car is destroyed. There are 6 bars in total.Fuel - The fuel gauge is shown across the top by a purple bar. If this bar depletes, an assistant gives a small amount of fuel to reach the charging units. There are 17 bars in total.Ammunition - This is shown by a yellow bar. This gauge measures how many missiles the player has left. If depleted, the play must recharge to collect more. There are 6 bars in total.Boost Bar - This gauge is shown just below the fuel gauge. Upon pressing the boost button, a small boost is given. But if the boost button is held for a long time, the player can boost much further. There are 19 bars in total.Minigun - This gauge is shown below the boost gauge, the machine gun can be used to damage other opponents. Whilst the gun itself has no bullet count, it does however use a cooldown mechanic. There are 16 bars in total.Upgrades - These are located below the Machine Gun Gauge. Upon collecting powerups in the tracks, they can be used to upgrade the damage of the machine gun, the damage of the missiles and the speed of how fast the boost gauge goes. They can all be upgraded to Level 3.Position - Located on the left and side below the armor gauge, it shows the current position of the player.Laps - This shows the current lap number and the total laps to go.Cars Destroyed - A skull icon is shown on the right hand side showing the number of vehicles the players has destroyed.Lap Times - This is shown on at the bottom left hand corner which shows silver for the best time and red for active lap time and previous times.Map - This is shown at the bottom right corner of the map which indicates the player's position and the position of the other vehicles.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are 6 tracks in total.Amazon Delta TurnpikeTrans-Asia InterstateShanghai DragonNew Chernobyl CentralSlam CanyonThrak City[CR]Vehicles[CR]Flexiwing - Fast and lighterOutrider - Weak but very fastVampyr - Faster and heavierJugga - Slow but strongKD-1 Speeder - An all-rounderBerserker - Powerful with the weaponsName of VehicleSpeedWeightArmourFirepowerBerserker3656Flexiwing8444Jugga4655KD-1 Speeder6545Outrider8535Vampyr6644[CR]Team Colors[CR]Before starting the race with the chosen vehicle, the team colors can also be chosen.

Unfortunately for Chauncey the land gifted to him by King of Franzpowanki is plagued by a group of goblin like creatures called The Horde, which are intent on destroying the crops, eating the cows, and burning humble abode's to the ground. Thus Chauncey must take up arms and protect his farm from the insatiable appetite of The Horde.[CR]Territories and Enemies[CR]If you manage to defend your farm through four seasons, turn a profit (after taxes), and eliminate the Horde threat in a certain territory the King of Franzpowanki tasks you with a new region to farm and defend. These new territories offer different terrain, a new breed of Hordling, as well as varied mini-quests.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The House of the Dead is an on rails shooting game featuring 4 stages each ending with a unique boss named after a tarot card. The game is 2-player. Player 1 plays as Rogan and Player 2 plays as G. The game's total play time usually clocks in at about 15-25 minutes.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]On December 18th 1998 Agent G and Thomas Rogan head to the Curien mansion after receiving a distress call from Rogan's love interest Sophie. Upon their arrival, they encounter a zombie ravaging one of the mansion's scientists. The scientist begs the two agents to save the other scientists inside the mansion. The game uses the scientists as their Hostage system. When they reach the mansion's courtyard they encounter Sophie being attacked by the Stage 2 boss. The boss proceeds to taunt the agents as he escapes with Sophie. The rest of the game is centered around stopping the mad scientist Curien who has seemingly raised the zombie army in an attempt to rule mankind.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]The House of the Dead first launched in arcades which featured ground breaking graphics for its time. After the success of the game, it was released on the Sega Saturn and the PC. These releases featured terrible visuals as they could not be supported by the systems at that time. A well known change is the transformation of Rogan's brown trench coat into a brown suit. These releases also had no mouth movements whatsoever.[CR]Light Gun Support[CR]The House of the Dead is one of the first games to take advantage of Light Gun support in a 3D world. This was true on home consoles and in arcades.[CR]Gore[CR]The House of the Dead was known to be one of the most violent games of its time. In an effort to censor some of the violent content many arcade machines and all home releases feature an option to turn the blood color to green.[CR]Chapters &amp; Bosses[CR]The First ChapterName: TragedyBoss: Chariot Type 27The Second ChapterName: RevengeBoss: Hangedman Type 041The Third ChapterName: TruthBoss: Hermit Type 6803The Final ChapterBoss: Magician Type 0[CR]</plot>

		<plot>With disregard for a background story, Funcom Dublin offers a Wipeout-esque mix of racing and driving at a very fast pace. Completing laps within the allotted time does not suffice, you also need to destroy a certain amount of vehicles. Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and firewalls. Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.[CR]Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings "city", "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the game's pace.</plot>

		<plot>Victory Goal '96, the direct sequel to Victory Goal (not to be mistaken for International Victory Goal, which unlike the game in question was distributed for all regions), is the game that set the bases further development of Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 and the sequels.[CR]From the previous games of the series this soccer game just kept the title, because the game engine, music, video scenes and almost everything else, all had the same ingredients that in the West could be seen for first time with the later Worldwide Soccer 97. Also, just as its prequel, this game includes all the teams of the Japanese J.League (of which it had an official license), but on the other hand, it does not include any international teams. The game features commentary tracks by two of Japan's most famous commentators.</plot>

It is the second installment in the King of Fighters series and introduces the concept of team customization. The American Sports Team is also replaced by the Rivals Team, featuring Fatal Fury rival Billy Kane, Art of Fighting rival Eiji Kisaragi, and the popular Iori Yagami, rival to Kyo Kusanagi. The story is similar to the previous game, as Rugal Bernstein hosts a tournament featuring the strongest warriors.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay was still the same as its previous title but a few alterations and additions were made to this game.

		<title_clean>Kisuishou Densetsu Astal</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Created by Sega, Astal was meant to be a showcase of the Sega Saturn's 2D capabilities. It features large, colorful sprites, and detailed background artwork that appears to have been hand-painted. Unfortunately, Astal's release came at a time where the gaming market was moving towards 3D graphics with Sony's Playstation console, resulting in poor sales. Due to the poor sales of the game, it is considered to be somewhat of a rarity in certain circles.Astal Punch!You play as namesake character Astal. Astal's primary method of attack is to grab enemies directly infront of him and throw them over his shoulder. By jumping in to the air and attacking, Astal slams his fists downward. Pressing down and attacking will cause Astal to violently punch the earth, stunning all enemies on screen. As a final method of attack, holding up on the D-pad will cause Astal to enhale large quantities of air, which can be released by pressing the attack button. A fully charged gust of wind can kill lesser enemies and stuns larger ones. After rescuing a small bird in the first level, Astal can command it to do various tasks for him, such as fetching extra health when needed, or attacking enemies. By plugging in a second controller, Player 2 is given control of the bird.[CR]Plot [CR]"Help me, Astal!"Somewhere in the universe, the Goddess Antowas created a world using only a single jewel. This world was known as Quartilia, and to inhabit this lonely world, Antowas created two humans: from a red jewel, a boy, named Astal; and from a green jewel, a girl, Leda. Leda was blessed by Antowas with the gift to create life, and it was Astal's job to protect Leda from any dangers. Despite Astal's sometimes over-protective nature, Leda fell in love with Astal. Content with her creation, the Goddess Antowas slept. Seeing his opportunity, the evil demon Gerado attempted to conquer Quartilia as his own; but Astal and Leda resisted his efforts. To help with this task, Gerado created his own human: Geist. Geist kidnapped Leda, and imprisoned her at the bottom of the Ocean. Astal fought bravely to rescue Leda, but in doing so, he shattered the bottom of the ocean, destroying it. The battle between Astal and Geist eventually woke Antowas, who fought Gerado and won. Angry with Astal for ruining the ocean, Antowas banished him - but Leda took pity on Astal, and gave him her necklace. With the matter of Astal and Gerado settled, Antowas went back to sleep once again. Unable to stand being separated from Leda, Astal shatters his bonds and frees himself from the realm Antowas had banished him to, only to return to find Leda has once again been kidnapped. Astal's quest to rescue Leda begins once again...[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Stage 1: The Journey BeginsStage 2: Into the DarknessBOSS: The Evil EyeStage 3: The Deep ForestStage 4: The River of DreamsBOSS: The Forest FiendStage 5: Volcanic ValleyBOSS: The Guardian of FireStage 6: Sea of CloudsStage 7: Glacial RiftStage 8: The Crystal PalaceBOSS: FrostbiteStage 9: Plains of DestinyBOSS: Destiny UnfoldsBOSS: The Fight for the Future[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Astal made frequent cameo appearances in Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic series, as cover artist Patrick Spaziante was a big fan of the game and the character.The North American Box for Astal contains an oddity among Sega Saturn titles: the spine for the game case is blank. Most game cases feature the game's logo on the spine, but Astal's is blank.Putting the Astal disc in to a CD player reveals a bonus music track: A vocal version of the game's main theme song, "Let Me Try Again", sung in Japanese.Hidden deep within the art files for Astal are sprites for Nintendo mascot Mario, drawn in the Astal visual style. These were most likely used as early test graphics.All english voices in the game are provided by Lani Minella, who voiced numerous other Sega characters, such as Rouge the Bat.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.[CR]The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.[CR]The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.[CR]After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.[CR]Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</plot>

		<title_clean>Kuro no Danshou - The Literary Fragment</title_clean>
		<plot>The Literary Fragment is the first game in  Abogado's mystery/horror/adult  Detective Suzusaki series. The story focuses on Satoshi Suzusaki, a private investigator with a tragic past, which has left a permanent scar on his life and mental abilities. The case that opens the game's story is a horrifying death of an entire family in their house, at the dining table; circumstances lead to an assumption of either a ritual suicide or murder. Suzusaki, his lovely secretary Asuka, and his young friend, psychologist extraordinaire Kusanagi, have to do everything in their powers to solve the case, while the hero's mysterious past continuous to haunt him...[CR]Though Suzusaki is the main hero of the game, the player sometimes controls and sees the events from Kusanagi's point of view. The gameplay is point-and-click adventure without puzzles. To interact with the object, the player is required simply to click on it. Sometimes, different ways of interactions open up, such as verb commands, dialogue choices, and decision-making.[CR]The game features scenes with horror content as well as explicit sexual situations.</plot>

		<title_clean>Langrisser III</title_clean>
		<plot>This is a prequel to the two  Langrisser games (the first one is known in the US as  Warsong). The events of the third game occur thousand years before those described in the first "Langrisser". The story centers around the creation of a holy sword named Langrisser, and the first Descendants of Light, the only people who can wield it. The main character is the knight Diharuto, the ancestor of Leon (Elwin's rival in "Langrisser II"). He must defeat the evil Boser, who is bound to the evil sword Alhazzard.[CR]In "Langrisser III", you don't control whole armies, but only their generals, whom you move around the battle field. Once two enemy generals meet each other, a 3D battle sequence occurs, during which the two armies fight; the outcome of the battle is decided only by the victory or defeat of the general. The game also features love simulation elements: depending on the main hero's responses to various female characters, you can raise their "love level".</plot>

		<title_clean>Langrisser V - The End of Legend</title_clean>
		<plot>The story of "Langrisser V" is closely connected to the one told in "Langrisser IV" - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe. [CR]The plot of "Langrisser V" revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another "child" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...[CR]"Langrisser V" features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The "Judgment System" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their "judgment level". Like in "Langrisser III", there is an element of "love simulation" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in May 1996, the same month as Soul Blade, the competition was steep from the beginning.Looking at the specifications and the reputation of the previously released games, Last Bronx would seem to be a sure winner. It was launched on Sega's model 2 board, and Sega had an excellent history with previous fighting games (Fighting Vipers, Virtua Fighter 1, 2, and the third installment which would be released in arcades later that year). Soul Blade's developer Namco had only released Tekken 1 and 2 in the 3d fighting genre, and so Last Bronx appeared to be the favorite, but in fact it was Soul Blade that became the more popular of the two games.Last Bronx was, despite the arcade competition, released for the Sega Saturn in 1997 and later the PC and Playstation 2 (as part of the Sega Ages series of releases for PS2 in japan).Last Bronx is a fighting game where the characters wield weapons similar to Soul Blade and Battle Arena Toshinden.The game is very fast paced and included the same three button system as the Virtua Fighter series, GUARD, PUNCH (weapon swing), and KICK.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Characters in the game are all gang leaders of different gangs.There are 8 playable characters initially, with one additional unlockable character.Joe - Metal NunchakuLisa - Doble Baston (two metal sticks)Ken Kono (Redeye) - Steel TonfasKudo - Samjiegun (three-section-staff)Kurosawa - Wooden Training KatanaNagi - Dual SaisSaburo - Giant Wooden HammerTommy - Bo/StaffYoko - Wooden Tonfas[CR]</plot>

		<plot>RayStorm is a shoot'em-up game created for the arcades, later ported to the Playstation and Saturn home consoles. Although there is no story connection, it is often thought of as the spiritual successor to RayForce, which had similar gameplay.[CR]You have 2 weapons at you disposal, a vulcan gun and a lock-on missile attack. You can also do 2 special attacks by using the lock-on system in a special way. The graphics are all in 3D, but the gameplay mechanics are in 2D. There are 7 stages, each ending with a giant end boss.</plot>

		<plot>Linda: Kanzenban ("Perfect Edition") is a slightly different version of  Linda Again - which, in its turn, is a remake of the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD  original version. [CR]For the most part, the game looks, sounds, and plays exactly the same as the Playstation remake. However, the Saturn version comes with a few extras, in-game as well as in the packaging.[CR]In addition to the new difficulty levels and mission objectives introduced in the Playstation remake, there are more statistics and battle objectives, which can be selected directly from the main menu and then set on the difficulty/mission selection screen. The game then keeps track of these battle records, similarly to the way it registers the amount of captured animals and other mission objectives.[CR]Packaging-wise, the game comes with an additional CD which contains the game's soundtrack. A mini artwork book with level designs and character sketches is also included.</plot>

		<title_clean>Lunar - Silver Star Story</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lunar: Silver Star Story is an epic story of friendship and love that revolves around a young child named Alex, who dreams of finding the four Dragons and becoming the next Dragonmaster, protector of the Goddess Althena.  Alex is obsessed with the legend of Dyne, the last known Dragonmaster who disappeared 15 years before the beginning of the story.  Alex, his adopted sister Luna, his best friend Ramus, and his flying, cat-like companion Nall set out towards the White Dragon Cave and spark off an adventure of epic proportions.  Along the way, they meet new allies who join them in their quest, as well as the Vile tribe, who loathe the Goddess Althena and will stop at nothing to hinder them.  The party unravels the tragic history surrounding the events that took place 15 years earlier, and as the situation becomes more dire, friendships will be tried, allies will become enemies, and amazing revelations will shake the foundations of the characters' beliefs.[CR]Complete[CR]The "Complete" version of Lunar is a remake of the Sega CD classic  Lunar: The Silver Star. The remake was released in two different versions for the Sega Saturn in 1996 and 1997 in Japan.  It was later released in on the Sony Playstation in Japan in 1998 and North America in 1999.  The remake included almost an entirely new soundtrack, over 40 minutes of hand- drawn anime FMV, and multiple altered plot elements.  Additionally, the Complete version featured a redesigned overworld map free of random encounters, fewer confusing dungeons,  and an additional dungeon.  Other changes include an alteration to character progression with the elimination of separate "magic experience", making saving free instead of costing the aforementioned magic experience, and linking the progression of new abilities to character levels instead of magic experience.  The box itself also came with plenty of extras, including a "making of" CD, the complete soundtrack, a hard bound instruction manual, and a cloth map of the world. The game also released with multiple different art on the game CD's in (at least) 3 different variations.   [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Alex NoahAlex is a young boy from the town of Burg.  He is obsessed with the legend of the Dragonmaster Dyne and strives to follow in his idol's footsteps.Luna NoahLuna is a young girl from the town of Burg, and the adopted sister of Alex.  She is gifted with an incredible singing voice that can draw magic from an unknown source.RamusRamus is Alex's best friend and the son of the Mayor of Burg.  Ramus is obsessed with money, but he is also a loyal friend to Alex that will support him in any situation.Nash Rumack Nash is an egotistical elitist from the magical floating city of Vane, and a powerful mage.  Nash is completely infatuated with Mia Ausa.  Although he's not afraid to gloat about his superior intellect and magical abilities, he often gets embarrasingly in over his head.Mia AusaMia is the daughter of Lemia Ausa, who is the leader of the Mages' Guild in Vane and one of the original Four Heroes.  Mia is intelligent and gifted in the ways of magic.  Despite her prestigious status, she is a shy and kind, if not reclusive, girl.  All of the students of the magic guild idolize her.  Lately, her mother's odd behavior has become more and more of a worry for her. KyleKyle is a brash, sexist bandit who guards the Nanza barrier.  However, when he's not "helping" people cross the Nanza barrier, he can often be found in some bar, getting drunk and fighting the locals.  His relationship with Jessica is constantly tested because of his lewd, womanizing behavior.Jessica Alkirk Jessica is the tomboy daughter of one of the last of the Four Heroes, Mel,  the Governor of Meridia.  However, she never shows her wild side in public appearences.  Although she is studying to be a priestess of Althena, she often ignores her studies and gets into trouble, usually because of her rocky relationship with Kyle.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Gameplay in Lunar slightly varies from other turn-based RPGs.  Both character placement and the ability to move characters around the battle areas allow for many strategically helpful and dangerous scenarios.  Area effect attacks can hit all targets in a certain area, and enemies and allies alike can be knocked around the battlefield by attacks.   [CR]Criticism[CR]Although the game received critical acclaim for its story, characters, and great voice acting (which was a rare feature for a JRPG in this era), reviewers complained of its dated, 2D graphics and old-school gameplay mechanics.  Still, Lunar: SSSC is still considered one of the best RPGs of all time by fans.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizards learned how to use the mana found in all living things to their advantage. Competition for this mana led to bitter rivalry and a turn towards the black arts. A cataclysmic event changed the face of the world and a wizard's apprentice is charged with restoring order.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are 3 objectives:Build and defend a castleCollect all available manaDestroy all creatures and wizardsA level is complete when the target for mana collection is reached.The castle is essential, acting as a respawn point and a store for collected mana. Without a castle, the player must restart the level if they die. Castles can be upgraded from a single building (level 1) to a 4 x 4 outer wall structure (level 7), with 1 to 3 balloons collecting mana. The player is invulnerable while inside the castle boundaries as it absorbs any damage. An ongoing attack or a large amount of damage will force the castle to downsize to a previous level, spilling excess mana into the surrounding area.Mana acts as a source of power for all spells. This spell power regenerates over time, and a preset amount of mana is required before the more powerful spells can be used. A wizard can change the state of mana balls using the possess spell. Neutral mana balls are orange; otherwise adopting the colour of the wizard that possessed them. Mana can be found in clusters around the level and appears when creatures are killed. If a wizard dies, another wizard can possess their corpse and in turn any of their uncollected mana.[CR]Creatures[CR]Early levels are populated with weaker creatures like giant bees, worms and birds. Crabs, griffins and kraken feature in later levels, using fireballs, meteors and lightning. Creatures will attack the player, other wizards and castles. The most powerful creature is the Wyvern, fast and deadly, immune to the Rebound spell and armed with Rapid Fireball.[CR]Spells[CR]New spells are collected on the earlier levels as urns. If a wizard is killed carrying one of the new spells, this will be dropped as an urn with their corpse for other wizards to collect.Fireball - the basic attack spellPossess - converts mana from a neutral state or steals it from another wizard. Also used to possess civilian buildings for a mana bonus.Accelerate (forwards) - a temporary speed boostCastle - creates or upgrades the player's base on the level, can be used on land or waterHeal - restores health until the player's mana is depletedRebound - deflects fireballs and meteors back at the creature or wizard that fired them. Mana will not regenerate while rebound is active.Shield - reduces damage caused by wizard spells to 25%Invisible - creatures and wizards are oblivious to your presence. Invisibility is broken when the player casts a spell.Earthquake - digs a channel through the terrainMeteor - an area-of-effect weapon, devastating when fired rapidly at wizards and their castlesCrater - weaker than Earthquake, creates a small craterVolcano - creates a volcano, useful for destroying enemy castles due to the ongoing eruptionsLightning - fires lightning bolts which lock onto a targetLightning storm - another area-of-effect weaponSkeleton army - raises an army of undead archers that will attack castles, balloons and wizardsMana magnet - consolidates mana balls in a radius into one larger ball, hastening mana collection and defence of uncollected manaSteal mana - regenerate your spell power by stealing it from another wizardBeyond sight - displays the location of other wizards on the mapDuel - locks wizards together so neither can escape until one uses Accelerate or diesTeleport - warps the player back to their castle. Casting again returns the player to the previous location.Wall of fire - creates a wall of fireAccelerate (reverse) - a temporary speed boostGlobal Death - a smart bomb. A bell will sound, followed by a purple flash. Creatures and wizards in range die instantly.Rapid fireball - fires a rapid stream of fireballs at the expense of a heavy mana drain[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The final level of the PC version was bugged, making it impossible to collect all of the mana and trigger the victory condition. Electronic Arts would supply a fixed version of the level on floppy disk.The PC version ran under DOS/4GW. Firing a rapid succession of volcanoes would often lead to a general protection fault, crashing back to DOS.In  an interview with Giant Bomb,  Peter Molyneux said that the core idea of the game, which is flying around on a magical carpet, is "the stupidest thing ever", and that he wishes that  Bullfrog had made a  corridor-shooter, which he asserts would've been much more successful.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Magic Knight Rayearth</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Magic Knight Rayearth is based on the popular anime and manga series by CLAMP. The game follows the story arc of the first season of the anime.The story follows the trials and tribulations of three Junior-High age girls who are on a field trip to the  Tokyo Tower in modern day. The girls,  Hikaru Shidou,  Umi Ryuuzaki and  Fuu Hououji, attend different schools but find themselves together after being teleported to a strange world named Cephiro. Upon arrival, they meet Master Mage Clef, who tells them that they were summoned there as the Legendary Magic Knights to save Cephiro from the High Priest Zagato, who has kidnapped and imprisoned Princess Emeraude.Not long after arriving, the three girls find themselves on a quest to free Princess Emeraude by releasing the three Rune-Gods, and aided by a strange creature Mokona. Each Rune-God corresponds to an element that they girls eventually learn to wield: fire for Hikaru, water for Umi, and wind for Fuu.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player moves through a burning house.Magic Knight Rayearth is an overhead 2D action RPG, similar in mechanics and theme to the  Legend of Zelda series. Instead of controlling a single character, the player is in control of all three characters at once. The lead character is selected in real-time by the player, with the other two characters following behind.Each of the three girls uses a different weapon and magic type, allowing the player to change strategies depending on the situation. Overworld exploration is done similarly to  The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, though each area/level is self contained, using a static image to show the player where in Cephiro the girls are currently questing.The gameplay radically shifts for the final level of the game, eschewing all the game&#8217;s previous mechanics, instead switching to an overhead shooter mechanic akin to Capcom&#8217;s 194X series.[CR]Release[CR]Magic Knight Rayearth has the distinction of being the last game release for the  Sega Saturn. Localization was handled by the now-defunct  Working Designs, a company that specialized in game translations from Japan. Working Designs Founder and CEO Victor Ireland publicly used Magic Knight Rayearth as an example of his company&#8217;s commitment to its customers, posting on its website that they would finish and release the game as promised, despite the financial burden it would entail for the company. In the game's closing credits, the company explicitly thanks the fans for their patience. Only 15,000 copies of the game were made.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack for Magic Knight Rayearth was composed by Seirou Okamoto and  Yayoi Wachi and released in Japan on August 25, 1995.Track ListingMagic Knight Rayearth Original SoundtrackName: Magic Knight Rayearth Original SoundtrackTotal Length: 57:42"Tokyo Tower" - 1:46"Chase" - 0:26"Forest of Silence" - 2:27"Ferio the Hurricane" - 1:13"A Monster Appears!" - 1:11"Heartbeat" - 2:13"Fantastic Eterna" - 3:20"The Magic Curtain of Polizu" - 2:10"Tempting Cave" - 1:51"A Strong Monster Appears!" - 1:16"Taflon by the Sea" - 1:41"Great Whirlpool" - 0:45"Eternal Ice Cave" - 2:13"Sadness" - 1:51"The Legendary Mashin" - 2:18"Mysterious Cefiro Lecture: - 1:46"White Ice of Rosen" - 1:38"Dancer" - 1:38"Tranquility" - 1:33"Special Training" - 1:05"An Even Stronger Monster Appears!" - 1:20"Whispering Woods" - 1:33"Distant Lake by the Sea of Trees" - 1:05"Old Man Rainbow's Shop" - 1:20"Sneaking Around" - 1:33"Sky Garden Aueria" - 1:18"Heaven's Labyrinth" - 1:57"Volcano Where the Truth Sleeps" - 2:07"Zagato!" - 2:17"Tragedy" - 2:07"Final Decisive Battle" - 1:34"Toward the Future..." - 2:11[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Marvel Super Heroes is Capcom's second fighting game based in the Marvel universe, after X-Men: Children of the Atom. The game introduces an Infinity Gem system that alters the stats of each character. The character assets would be reused in later Marvel vs. games.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay system used in Marvel Super Heroes is similar to its predecessor, X-Men: Children of the Atom, including multi-screen vertical jumps. Marvel Super Heroes adds Infinity Supers and the Infinity Gem System (below) . Also new for Marvel Super Heroes is the Aerial Rave, which allows the player to continue a combo after the opponent has been launched into the air.Infinity Gem SystemDuring the fight, collectible gems appear when damage is inflicted on the player's opponent. Activating these gems increase stats for your character. Examples include a shield, raising attack, reality, health recovery, increased speed, and more.PowerThe six Infinity GemsGives the character greater attack damage, as well as more powerful grabs and throws. Some characters receive unique attacks. For example, Spider-Man can create a clone/duplicate on the opposite side of the opponent, Captain America can change his special attacks into super attacks, Wolverine can cause a trail to follow him and increase his hits/combos, and Psylocke can create three shadow versions of herself that deal damage.TimeSpeeds up character movement. Characters with unique attacks for the Time Gem are The Hulk (can more rapidly fire his strongest attacks), and Shuma-Gorath (normal attacks turn opponents into stone).SpaceIncreases the character's defense. Characters with special uses are Juggernaut and Magneto, who become immune to enemy attacks, as in X-Men: Children of the Atom.RealityAdds elemental effects alongside normal attacks, such as flames, icicles, and lightning bolts. When using this gem, Blackheart also turns invisible.SoulThe character regenerates health. When using the Soul Gem, Iron Man gains extra electric damage with his normal attacks, which also drain energy from the Super Attack Gauge.MindAllows the character to regenerate their Super Attack Gauge. In the single-player arcade mode, the player is not able to use this gem until the final battle, as it is in Thanos' possession. To obtain this gem, the player must take the five other gems from Thanos, and only then take the Mind gem by using super combos.Each gem is named after each of Thanos's super-attacks.PowerCreates a little sun, then throws his opponent at it.TimeReduces his opponent's speed by half.SpaceOpens up a hole in space and drops asteroids on his opponent.RealityCrushes his opponent with two stone walls.SoulUses an energy pulse that drains his opponent's health into his own health bar.MindReverses his opponent's controls for a short period of time.Thanos doesn't need the gem to use that specific super-attack, but the CPU controlled Thanos will not use the super-attack without that specific gem. A player-controlled Thanos, however, can still execute the super-attacks without the corresponding gem.Infinity SupersMarvel Super Heroes also introduced the iconic Infinity Supers, such as Iron Man's "Proton Cannon", Spider-Man's "Maximum Spider", and Hulk's "Gamma Crush". Some of the X-Men characters, like Wolverine and Psylocke, have more than one infinity super.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As in other Capcom fighting games, each character has their own story line. The player picks a character and fights a random sequence of opponents, always ending with the final boss, Thanos. After beating Thanos, the player is rewarded with an animated cutscene that is unique for each character. Most of the end cutscenes are just a few minutes long, and each one follows the character's specific continuity within the Marvel universe.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Marvel Super Heroes character select screenSpider-Man (Spider-Man)Wolverine (X-Men)Psylocke (X-Men)Juggernaut (X-Men)Magneto (X-Men)Shuma-Gorath (Dr. Strange)Captain America (The Avengers)Blackheart ( Ghost Rider)Iron Man (The Avengers)The Incredible Hulk (The Avengers)Unlockable CharactersDoctor Doom (Fantastic Four)Thanos (The Avengers)Anita (Darkstalkers)**Anita is only available in Japanese home versions of Marvel Super Heroes (though can be accessed in western versions through cheat devices). However, she is playable in all versions of Marvel Super Heroes included in Marvel Vs. Capcom Origins. She is test character that was left unfinished and unbalanced. When selected her icon appears as Thanos (As an icon was never created for her) and her name is not said when she wins a match even though it says "Anita Wins" on screen.[CR]Ports[CR]In 1997, ports of the arcade game were released for the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. Both versions contained the same characters, levels, and musical score, unchanged from the arcade release, although the intro movie was altered for the home releases.The PlayStation version suffers from significant frame rate issues. Most notably, the game can drop to as few as 20 frames per second when activating gems. The Saturn port also suffered from frame rate problems, but not as badly with the (optional) use of a 4MB RAM expansion cartridge, which, despite the lack of US release, still functions with the US Version of the game. The RAM cartridge also enabled additional frames of animation, making it the more popular choice of the two ports.The original arcade version of the game was remastered along with the original Marvel Vs. Capcom in HD as Marvel vs Capcom Origins for XBLA and PSN.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Metal Slug (also known as Metal Slug: Super Vehicle - 001) is an arcade run-and-gun action platformer developed and released by Nazca (released by SNK in Japan) for the Neo Geo on May 24, 1996. Known for its fluid animation and sense of humor, Metal Slug would eventually spawn a franchise, as well as ports for the Neo Geo CD, Saturn (only in Japan on April 4, 1997), and PlayStation (only in Japan on August 7, 1997).The game is set in the year 2026, during an ongoing war between the armies of the modern world (known as the Regular Army) and the powerful Rebellion (led by the ruthless General Morden). When the Rebellion captured a group of new, advanced all-terrain combat vehicles (known as SV-001, or "Metal Slug"), players take control of Marco Rossi or Tarma Roving, elite soldiers of the Peregrine Falcon Squad, to locate the vehicles... as well as Morden's powerbase.The game was later released in the Metal Slug Anthology compilation in December 14, 2006 and the SNK Arcade Classics V.1 compilation in April 29, 2008, both for the PlayStation 2, Wii, and PSP. The game was also released for the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console) on May 26, 1998 and the PC (via GameTap) on December 4, 2010.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Driving in a vehicle.The player can select either Marco Rossi or Tarma Roving as their character, and is paradropped into the start of each level armed with a pistol, grenades, and a set of melee moves. These moves are knifing and kicking attacks that trigger automatically when the player presses the fire button within close range of an enemy. Power-ups with limited ammunition, including heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers can be picked up for additional firepower. At certain points the player can also jump into tanks, which provide an even greater capability for destruction and a limited amount of added protection. Metal Slug's gameplay is a run-and-gun style that is similar to Contra. The player is pitted against a massive slew of constantly spawning and attacking enemies. The objective is for the player to blast their way through each level, freeing prisoners and collecting items on the way. In addition to the normal grunt enemies, there are also boss battles which require the player to empty large amounts of ammo into the bosses before they fall.Slug VehiclesAdvanced tanks, named " Super Vehicle-001," are encountered in each of Metal Slug's levels. They serve not only as additional firepower, but also provide added protection against the normal one-hit death health vulnerability. If hit by enemy fire while within a Slug Vehicle, power-ups shaped like gas cans can be collected by the player to restore their tank's health meter. In keeping with the game's cartoonish humor, the player may also still jump and duck while piloting the Slug Vehicle to avoid attacks.BossesA boss.The boss battles in Metal Slug can absorb many shots and are often much larger than normal enemies (much like conventional bosses), they are often encountered at the end of certain levels and have a vulnerability or weak point that needs to be exploited by the player (also like conventional bosses). These boss battles are often of high difficulty (again, just like conventional bosses) and some take great skill to defeat.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Advertisement featuring four of the new playable charactersMortal Kombat II is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1993 for arcades. Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic "Toasty!" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an "X" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut).Finishing MovesBaraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no "endurance matches" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the "?" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the "Toasty!" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row).

The victim falls to his or her knees before splitting apart down the center in two opposing directions.Fatality 2: Kung Lao throws his hat from a distance with a slight upward arc, catching the victim just under the neck and decapitating him or her.[CR]         Johnny Cage [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Cage rips the torso off of his victim and tosses it away, leaving only a pair of standing legs.Fatality 2: Cage revisits his fatality from the original game, using an uppercut to decapitate his victim. A special button combination can be executed during the fatality to guarantee that two more heads are punched off (out of thin air, natch).[CR]         Reptile [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reptile removes his mask, revealing his true reptilian face. He then opens wide, snaring the opponent's head with his long tongue, rips it clean off, and eats it.Fatality 2: While invisible, Reptile pops his victim's torso up into the air and away from the legs.[CR]         Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Sub-Zero freezes his victim in showers of ice. He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an "ice grenade" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs.[CR]         Shang Tsung [CR] (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he "bursts out" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand.

The victim doesn't immediately die (of blood loss).[CR]         Mileena [CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Mileena pulls out both of her sai and, in rapid-fire style, repeatedly stabs her victim in the torso, leaving behind a massive spray of blood.Fatality 2: Mileena removes her mask, revealing Tarkatan teeth. She then inhales her victim, then turns around and spits out a plethora of shiny bones.[CR]         Baraka [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Richard Divizio Fatality 1: Baraka decapitates his victim with one swipe of his arm blades.Fatality 2: Baraka unleashes both of his arm blades and impales his victim through the chest. As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air.[CR]         Scorpion [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs.[CR]         Raiden [CR] (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes.[CR]        Kintaro [CR](sub-boss, unplayable) [CR]        Shao Kahn [CR](boss, unplayable)Actor:  Brian Glynn [CR]        Jade [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)Actor: Katalin Zamiar[CR]        Smoke [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]       Noob Saibot [CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]Arenas[CR]There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Shao Kahn's Arena is always the stage in Kintaro and Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include special Stage Fatalities are The Dead Pool (where the player uppercuts the opponent into acid), The Kombat Tomb (where the player uppercuts the opponent into previously hidden ceiling spikes), and The Pit II (where the player uppercuts the opponent off the side of the bridge and into the rocky ground below). The Dead PoolThe Living Forest The Kombat Tomb The Wasteland The Tower The Living Forest  The Armory The Pit II The Portal Shao Kahn's Arena [CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original release of Mortal Kombat II on the Midway T-Unit arcade board went through four released revisions (1.1, 1.4, 2.1, and 3.1). While revisions 1.1 and 1.4 were available to the public, they were considered unfinished, missing some Fatalities, some special moves, all endings, all Friendships, all Babalities, all secret opponents, and all Stage Fatalities. Revision 3.1 is the final version, featuring all Fatalities, special moves, endings, Friendships, Babalities, secret opponents, Stage Fatalities, and bugfixes. The arcade release was considered a smash hit, with special guards on the arcade machines to protect the arcade board from being stolen.Almost a year later, the game was ported to various consoles. Home versions hit the market on &#8220;Mortal Friday&#8221; September 10, 1993 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. The SNES version of the original Mortal Kombat was criticized for its lack of blood, so blood was included in the SNES version of MKII. It was featured in the launch library for the Sega 32X when it launched in November 1994. Versions for the PC and Amiga were released in late-1994 as well. Rare versions of the game were released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, and featured excessive loading times. For example, if Shang Tsung morphed into another character, the game would pause mid-match to load this new character, then pause for each consecutive move that required new animations or sound to load in.The original arcade release was later included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam). The game was also included as an unlockable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.On April 12, 2007, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on the PlayStation Network for $4.99, featuring online play.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a compilation of each previous Mortal Kombat game, bringing them together in a new, single title. Every fighter and most levels from every preceding title returns, bringing the total roster to over 32 fighters. Due to technical limitations at the time, there are several slight differences between the CD and cartridge based versions, most relating to the need to load and cache things on the CD version before play, such as transformations for Shang Tsung in order to reduce loading during a fight (an issue that existed in Mortal Kombat 3 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3). The most obvious difference is the extension of the " Shao Kahn's Treasure" in the Nintendo 64 version, where players have twenty-four options to pick from instead of twelve seen in the other versions. The CD versions feature more bosses than the N64 version as well as improved sound quality. Conversely, the Nintendo 64 version lacks several characters seen in the disc versions because of a lack of space on the cartridge. These are mainly classic versions of several characters, but two bosses were excluded as well: Goro and Kintaro.In 1998, Mortal Kombat 4 proceeded Mortal Kombat Trilogy on home consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat Trilogy uses the same story as Mortal Kombat 3, which has Shao Kahn acting as the main antagonist. Shao Kahn is presented as the millennium-old emperor of Outworld, a dark world that exists in parallel to Earth. Many years ago, the Elder Gods created the Mortal Kombat tournament in order to prevent an invasion from Outworld. For many years, Goro reigned as the supreme champion of the tournament, but eventually Liu Kang defeated him and became the new champion. Liu Kang, along with other fighters from the tournament, were drawn into Outworld and forced to compete in a new tournament. But the tournament was merely a ruse to distract the warriors from his true intentions: resurrecting Queen Sindel and taking over Earth. At the onset of the game, players must fight their way up the tournament roster, eventually reaching Shao Kahn and defeating him, thwarting his invasion and releasing many souls of fallen warriors from his body.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat Trilogy plays much like its predecessor Mortal Kombat 3/UMK3, with a few additions. Several characters have new moves, previously not seen in the series or ones that had to be cut for one reason or another. Another addition was the "Aggression" bar, which would increase as a player landed successful hits on their opponent; when the bar filled, they would temporarily move faster and deal more damage.Players can choose from the story-based Tournament mode as well as other arcade modes for quick matches. In the Tournament mode, a player selects one character and then battles their way up a tower of AI controlled opponents until the eventual showdown with Shao Kahn. The higher the difficulty level a player chooses, the more combatants they much fight as well as an overall increase in AI competency. A player works their way up the tower by beating each opponent in a standard match of first to get two victories. At the end of the second victory, the announcer shouts "Finish Him!" and players are able to perform a hallmark " Fatality" or any other finishing move that had been introduced in previous titles, including " Animalities," " Babalities," " Friendships" and the new " Brutalities," 11-input combos that result in the explosion of their opponent. Players will face off with bosses at various segments throughout their progression up the tower, most of which are less phased by attacks than a standard foe. The final boss of the tower is Shao Kahn, and upon defeating him, players can choose a "treasure" which demonstrates a certain aspect of the game or in one case on the Nintendo 64, shows each finishing attack for every character in the game.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The Character Select Screen from the PlayStation, PC, and Sega Saturn versions.The character roster is built from the roster from the console versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, adding characters and appearances from previous Mortal Kombat games while making boss characters playable. The PlayStation, PC, and Sega Saturn versions of the game include the full roster with the exception of Khameleon (bringing its total roster to 37). The Nintendo 64 version of the game includes Khameleon as a secret character, but leaves out Chameleon, Kano and Raiden's MK1 appearances, Jax and Kung Lao's MK2 appearances, unmasked Sub-Zero, Goro, and Kintaro (bringing its total roster to 30). The Game.com port includes only 13 playable characters.Johnny Cage is the only character in the game to receive entirely new digitized graphics (using another actor). Some characters received new graphics, primarily due to missing animations. The two new characters, Chameleon and Khameleon, are simply based on the male and female ninja bases from UMK3.Johnny Cage (not available in the Game.com version)Noob Saibot (console Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Baraka (Mortal Kombat II, not available in the Game.com version)Cyrax (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sonya (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Raiden (known in the game as Rayden, Mortal Kombat II (with secret Mortal Kombat appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64 and Game.com))Rain (console Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Shang Tsung (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Kitana (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Kano (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (with secret Mortal Kombat appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64), not available in the Game.com version)Scorpion (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Sub-Zero (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, both masked and un-masked in all versions except Nintendo 64 (where only masked Sub-Zero is included), not available in the Game.com version)Smoke (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, both human and robot, not available in the Game.com version)Reptile (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Jax (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (with secret Mortal Kombat II appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64), not available in the Game.com version)Mileena (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sektor (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Liu Kang (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Jade (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sheeva (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Kung Lao (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (with secret Mortal Kombat II appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64), not available in the Game.com version)Nightwolf (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sindel (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Ermac (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Stryker (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Kabal (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Goro (Mortal Kombat, not available in the Nintendo 64 or Game.com versions)Shao Kahn (final boss, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Motaro (boss, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Kintaro (Mortal Kombat II, not available in the Nintendo 64 or Game.com versions)Chameleon (secret character, not available in the Nintendo 64 or Game.com versions)Khameleon (secret character, Nintendo 64 version only)[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Mr. Bones is a unique game released exclusively for the Saturn. It combines several different types of gameplay. Some levels are side-scrolling action, some have a top-down perspective, and still others are single-screen mini games.[CR]The story is meant to be a humorous horror tale. An evil wizard known as Dagoulian has created an army of skeleton warriors, and he plans to use this army to conquer the world. Fortunately for us, one of the skeletons he raised, Mr. Bones, was not obedient to his commands. You play as Mr. Bones as he attempts to both escape from Dagoulian and put and end to his plot.[CR]There is a lot of video to watch in Mr. Bones. In fact, there is so much video that the game uses 2 CD-ROMs. The video is a combination of computer-generated animation and live action. Mr. Bones is a computer generated character, while Dagoulian is played by an actor.</plot>

		<title_clean>Myst</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Myst is a puzzle adventure game designed by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. It was developed by their company Cyan (later known as Cyan Worlds) and was originally published by Br&#248;derbund in 1993 for Apple Macintosh computers. The game was originally programmed in HyperCard, a hypermedia programming tool available for legacy Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. This tool was capable of producing applications that function similarly to simple HTML webpages.Myst was one of the first games released on CD-ROM and heavily contributed to the format's early success in terms of interactive software. After its release for IBM-compatible PCs in 1994, Myst quickly became the best-selling PC game of all time until The Sims broke its record in 2002. The original game became the basis for a highly-successful media franchise that spawned four direct sequels, several spin-off games and three novels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Myst IslandMyst's gameplay is exclusively point-and-click from a first-person perspective. Players explore the world of Myst by clicking on sections of hundreds of static pre-rendered scenes, and can interact with certain objects in the world by clicking or dragging them with the mouse cursor. Myst's limited animations are videos embedded into these pre-rendered backgrounds, giving players a greater sense of immersion despite the limitations of CPU processing power available for the game's initial release. Because the scenes were pre-rendered, the game's artists were able to portray the worlds of Myst as highly-detailed 3D environments, which wouldn't have been possible if the game had instead been rendered in real-time.The player is presented with many puzzles that must be solved in order to progress, some of which are integrated into the environment and may not be immediately apparent as puzzles. There is no explicit violence, no time limit and no threat of death; the world of Myst is serene and designed to immerse players in its atmospheric presentation as they unravel the secrets of the mysterious island at their own pace.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Channelwood AgeMyst begins with an opening cutscene narrated by an unidentified man (later established to be Atrus, one of the franchise's central characters) as he describes his plunge into a black "fissure" full of stars. The man is only able to catch a brief glance at his surroundings before suddenly vanishing, leaving behind a mysterious book that continues its descent through the expanse of stars. He apprehensively speculates about where his book may eventually land before admitting that such conjecture is futile, finally concluding that "perhaps the ending has not yet been written".The player character, known unofficially as "the Stranger", discovers Atrus' lost book. When the Stranger opens the book and touches an animated image on the first page, they find themselves transported to the surreal island of Myst. The Stranger must explore the seemingly-deserted island in search of clues regarding its former inhabitants and their purposes, ideally discovering a way back to their home on Earth in the process.Eventually the Stranger enters a small library containing several books, many of which have been burned and are no longer legible. However, the library also holds two conspicuously-undamaged books - one red, one blue - that each appear to contain a person trapped inside. They are Sirrus and Achenar, a pair of brothers and the sons of Atrus. The books that have imprisoned Sirrus and Achenar are missing several of their pages, causing their animated Linking panels to become obscured by rolling static and making communication very difficult. By restoring the missing pages to both books, each brother's speech becomes clear enough to claim that the other betrayed both Atrus and himself, presenting the Stranger with the dilemma of whom to trust. The Stranger is tasked with finding the brothers' remaining pages in order to progress toward the game's conclusion.Continuing their investigation, the Stranger discovers several additional Linking books hidden throughout Myst Island behind a series of meticulously-constructed puzzles. Each book transports the Stranger to a different world known as an "Age", where they must solve each Age's resident puzzles before returning to Myst Island with either a red or blue page in hand. The Stranger can uncover further clues as to what exactly happened on Myst along the way, including several journals and notes written by Atrus. A recorded holographic message addressed to his wife Catherine mentions Atrus' burned library on Myst, as well as his suspicions that one of his own sons is responsible for its destruction.EndingsStoneship AgeBy returning additional red or blue pages to their respective books on Myst Island, each brother's communications gradually become clearer as they continue to decry the other's treachery. Once the fifth page of either book has been returned, the book's occupant recounts their own vague version of the events leading to Atrus' murder. He also reveals the location of a code book leading to a secret chamber inside the library containing the final red and blue pages. While each brother implores the Stranger to only retrieve their own respective pages, both Sirrus and Achenar warn the Stranger not to touch a certain green book which is also located in the secret chamber. They claim it is yet another prison book created by Atrus, much like the two they are currently trapped inside, and that the player will also be trapped if the green book is opened.The Stranger is thus given three options: return the red page to Sirrus, return the blue page to Achenar, or ignore both brothers' warnings and open the green book. In the end, both brothers prove to be completely untrustworthy; several clues can be found throughout the game's different Ages suggesting that both Sirrus and Achenar became twisted, cruel individuals bent on abusing and exploiting these Ages and their inhabitants. If the player ignores these hints and restores the final page to either the red or blue books, they will find themselves sucked into the book as its previous occupant is simultaneously released. Sirrus or Achenar thanks the player before proceeding to gleefully rip pages from their former prison book, thereby trapping the Stranger inside indefinitely.Players that investigate the green book instead will be presented with a linking panel displaying an image of Atrus, very much alive and sitting behind a writing desk in an unfamiliar location. He quickly warns the player not to link to "D'ni" (later retconned to be a section of the subterranean D'ni City known as K'veer) before describing how his sons were corrupted by greed and a lust for power, leading the brothers to trap both Catherine and himself in separate prisons so that they could lord over Atrus' written Ages without restraint. Atrus begs the player to ignore their lies and retrieve the single white page torn from his own damaged linking book so that he can return to Myst Island and deliver justice to his scheming sons.Mechanical AgeLinking to D'ni without the white page causes Atrus to bemoan the Stranger's stupidity and the fact that, without a way out, they will both be trapped there forever. If the player instead locates the hidden page on Myst Island and returns it to Atrus, he will use it to repair his Myst linking book, stating that he faces a "difficult choice" before linking back to Myst himself. After a few moments, Atrus reappears in D'ni and tells the Stranger "it is done." However, he reveals that his wife Catherine is still trapped and fears that his own long imprisonment may have had a "catastrophic impact" on the world in which she is being held hostage (this is established to be the Age of Riven in the game's sequel). Atrus offers his library on Myst and the exploration of his surviving Ages as a reward to the Stranger for their help; he also mentions that he may require the Stranger's assistance again in the future.After Atrus' speech, players may return to Myst Library via Atrus' linking book. Two large burn marks can now be found where the red and blue books once sat, implying that Atrus has destroyed his sons' prison books permanently.[CR]Ports and Remakes[CR]The game has been remade on the PC twice.

		<title_clean>NBA Jam - Tournament Edition</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam Tournament Edition is the second game in Midway&#8217;s basketball arcade series, featuring two-on-two fast paced matches with NBA players from the 1993-94 season (1994-95 on consoles). In total, the game features over 120 NBA athletes and over 40 hidden characters. Improvements include additional power-ups, more detailed player attributes, player substitutions after each quarter, and a new soundtrack. The namesake "Tournament Mode" turns off all cheats and power-ups, and rewards players with expanded rosters for nearly all teams if the player beats all 27 teams.In addition to these features, console releases added practice and &#8220;juice&#8221; modes, optional game toggles like "hotspots" and power-up icons, and an "injury" stat that lowers a character's stats. Later console releases (Jaguar, Saturn, PlayStation) also featured larger character sprites and scaling effects to match those of the Arcade version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the "Turbo" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the "???" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the "Quick Hands" and "Max Power" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.All versions of the game also include "Power-up" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up.ConsolesHotspots enabledSome additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. "Hot Spots" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. "Power-up" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant "on fire," or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a "Juice" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.The console releases also added an "Injury" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.Console releases also include an optional "Tag Mode" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions.Computer AI AnalysisThe computer artificial intelligence seems to have two different modes. In one mode (mostly seen in early tournament matches) the computer adopts a more passive defensive strategy. They will rarely ever try to push the player over, and the player can often simply run the length of the court and put up a three, or go for an easy dunk without ever worrying about passing. On offense, they tend to often go for three pointers, and will almost always make them if the player doesn't steal or block the ball first (especially if the player is ahead in score). The AI will rarely ever go inside the paint for a lay up or a dunk in this mode.In the second mode (mostly seen in later tournament matches) the computer is much more aggressive. They will often try to push the player over, making it almost impossible to progress the ball up the length of the court without passing the ball to the other player frequently. Also, if the player tries to put up a three, they will almost always get shoved by the opposing computer controlled AI player if he is nearby. This makes it hard to get three pointers up, and the player can end up getting pummeled if they do not pass frequently. On offense, the AI will frequently go for dunks and attack the paint. However, if the player leaves them wide open on the perimeter they will pull up a three and make it almost all the time.In general, AI in the first mode is much easier to deal with than the aggressive second mode. The one advantage the first mode has to the second mode is on the offensive side because they will often go for three pointers and will make them almost all the time meaning they can come back quickly if the player is sloppy on the offensive end. However, because of the second modes extremely aggressive defensive, it is more often than not much harder to deal with. Though if the player can manage to get a huge lead on them, it is a lot harder for this mode to make a come back because they often don't put up three pointers.Always going for dunks is a good strategy when in the leadHowever, it is hard to get a big lead on either types of AI because of the Rubber Band AI effect. As the player's lead grows, the probability of making shots becomes progressively lower, while the AI's probability of success progressively increases. One strategy to deal with this is to always go for dunks after starting to get a lead bigger than two possessions (4 points), because dunks have a very high probability of going in. Likewise, never go for three pointers because the probability of a three pointer going in is very small when the player has a lead. Also increasing the defense on the perimeter is recommended because the computer's probability of making a three pointer when the player has a big lead is nearly 100%. This is why the second computer AI mode is easier to get a big lead on because they tend to not go for three pointers and have tougher defense on the perimeter than they do in the paint.It is interesting to note that if, in the last seconds before half-time or the end of the match, the computer has the ball and they throw up a full court shot it will always go in (a 100% probability) regardless of the score, but if they advance the ball to half court and shoot it from there their probability of making the shot is significantly reduced. For the player, the probability of making a full court shot is very small, giving the computer a competitive edge at the end of the game. Also in the last ten seconds before halftime or the end of the game the computer will become extremely aggressive (even more so than the second AI mode) regardless of the type of AI the player may be facing. If the player has the ball the computer will sprint full speed towards him/her and try to steal the ball and take a quick shot. So if the player is not careful, the computer can score 4 or 6 points in the final 10 seconds using quick steals and shots.[CR]Teams and Players[CR]NBA Team RostersKevin WillisAtlanta Hawks: Stacey Augmon, Mookie Blaylock, Kevin WillisBoston Celtics: Dee Brown, Dino Radja, Dominique Wilkins ( Xavier McDaniel, Eric Montross)Charlotte Hornets: Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning ( Dell Curry, Hersey Hawkins)Chicago Bulls: B.J.

		<plot>NBA Jam Extreme is an NBA Jam game with a whole new engine and is in "3-D." It follows the 1996-97 season. The announcer for the game is Marv Albert, and there are over 2,000 lines in the game such as "Boom-Shakalaka," "Razzle-Dazzle," and "He's on fire!" There is an extreme button featured in this game which acts as a turbo button. There are 60 hidden characters, special teams (such as a superstar '90s team), 30 dances and dunks, and easter eggs such as "big-head" mode. Some of the modes of the game include exhibition, round-robin, one-on-one, and two-on-two. In round-robin you compete in games until you lose a game. Some players that were not able to make it into the game because of contractual obligations were Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>NiGHTS into Dreams...</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NiGHTS was born out of a simple concept: capturing the sensation of flight. Released the same month as Super Mario 64, some viewed it as Sega's answer to Nintendo's mascot superstar. In reality, NiGHTS into Dreams, much like the Sonic titles, shares more in common with traditional arcade gaming, complete with high score tables displayed at the end of each level and a score multiplier awarded depending on how well you perform during the boss encounter. Nights was known for its innovative, gravity-defying, gameplay mechanics.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Elliot at the Ideya PalaceAfter choosing between playing as Elliot Edwards (the boy) or Claris Sinclair (the girl), players are dropped into a fully 3D environment where their most immediate task is to reclaim the four "Ideya Spheres" that have been stolen and hidden within the level. While players can go searching for them on foot, they are incredibly vulnerable whilst in their human form, so their best bet is to approach and enter the Ideya Palace and transform into the flying purple jester known as NiGHTS.The gameplay shifts between 3D and 2.5 D. As Elliot and Claris the game offers a fully developed 3D landscape, as Nights however the game changes to a side scrolling perspective with Nights locked into one of four possible paths. The game is essentially lap based with each lap consisting of a different path. The only way to switch paths it to collect 20 blue chips and bring them to an Ideya Spheare. Doing this and completing a lap will cause the path to alternate in which the player must do the same thing again. After completing all 4 paths the game switches a boss' lever.As Nights players are essentially invincible with the only penalty for being hit being loss of time. Time however is a very valuable resource in this game with players only being given a limited amount as Nights before being turned back to human form. Failing to complete all the paths in a regular level before time is up means that players will have to collect all 20 blue chips and return them to an Ideya shphere before being allowed to become Nights again. On foot players can die with one hit. Furthermore, an alarm clock relentlessly tracks players while on foot, which will also kill the player if it catches them.In the boss levels there are no humans allowed. Running out of times in these will lead to an immediate game over.[CR]Other versions[CR]Christmas NightsFor Christmas of 1996, SonicTeam and Sega released a special extended demo called Christmas NiGHTS which includes its own content (reskinned graphics, the ability to play as Sonic, and more) and even an entire level (sans boss) not found in the full game.PlayStation 2 portIn 2007, eleven years after the original NiGHTS was released, Sega remade NiGHTS for the Playstation 2, with enhanced graphics and bonus extras.Xbox Live. Playstation Network ports.In October 2012, Sega released a version of Nights into Dreams for the Xbox 360 and Playstation Network. This port is based on the PlayStation2 port.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]NiGHTS and ClarisThe evil Wizeman, King of the Nightmaren, is no longer satisfied with simply controlling the dream world of Nightopia. He seeks more! Wizeman hatches a plot to use Ideya Dream Energy to shake off the shackles of the dream world and enter our reality, where his power to shape and create nightmares will leave him unstoppable. To help him accomplish this task, he crafts two special first-class Nightmaren: a pair of jesters by the names of NiGHTS and Reala. He commands the pair to seek out and capture any Ideya they can find, especially the rare red Ideya, representing the emotion of Bravery.Ungrateful to its creator, NiGHTS rebels against Wizeman's orders. As punishment, Wizeman seals NiGHTS in an Ideya Prison; the only way he can be freed is if somebody uses their Ideya energy to temporarily unlock his cage, and with his Nightmaren collecting all the Ideya for themselves, it is not likely NiGHTS will ever be released. However, two special dreamers - a pair of children named Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair - have an abundance of Red Ideya energy and find themselves very near NiGHTS' holding cell...[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]ClarisSpring Valley ~the IDEAL~ (Boss: Gilwing)Mystic Forest ~the POSSIBILITY~ (Boss: Gulpo)Soft Museum ~the CONFUSION~ (Boss: Jackle)Twin Seeds ~the GROWTH~ (Boss: Wizeman)ElliotSplash Garden ~the AFFECTION~ (Boss: Puffy)Frozen Bell ~the CONSCIOUSNESS~ (Boss: Clawz)Stick Canyon ~the REVIVAL~ (Boss: Reala)Twin Seeds ~the GROWTH~ (Boss: Wizeman)[CR]PlayStation 2 Re-Release[CR]"Brand New Dream" modeNiGHTS: into Dreams... was released for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan in 2007. Initially thought to be part of Sega's " Sega Ages 2500" releases, it did not bear the budget line's branding and was instead a full-priced product. The PlayStation 2 version of NiGHTS features all of the content from the original Sega Saturn release as well as a visually remastered "Brand New Dream" mode.A number of bonus features from Christmas NiGHTS were also incorporated, including image galleries, the Nightopian viewer, and the Christmas version of Spring Valley. However, other features, like Link Attack, Karaoke Mode, and Sonic into Dreams remain exclusive to the Sega Saturn version of Christmas NiGHTS. The PlayStation 2 version of NiGHTS also adds four new calendar-related events, which imbue Claris and Elliot with special bonus costumes:July 20th: Play Splash Garden as Claris in a summer outfit.August 31st: Play Splash Garden as Elliot in a summer outfit.October 1st-30th: Play Mystic Forest as Claris in a witch costume.October 31st: Play Mystic Forest as Elliot in a vampire costume.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]NiGHTS Original SoundtrackMusic for NiGHTS was composed by Naofumi Hataya, Tomoko Sasaki, and Fumie Kumatani. The soundtrack was released in Japan by PolyGram on July 10, 1996. The game contains one vocal track, with two variations: one version is sung by children (presumably Claris and Elliot themselves), with a second version playing over the credits as a reward for completing the game with all A ranks.NiGHTS Original SoundtrackTotal length: 57:30NiGHTSGate of Your DreamPaternal HornThe Dragon Gave a Loud ScreamTake the Snow TrainThe MantleMessage from NightopiaGloom of the N.H.C.E-LE-KI SparkleThe Amazing WaterDeep it LiesDreams Dreams ~In Silent Memory~Suburban MuseumShe Had Long EarsUnder ConstructionNights and RealaGrowing WingsNights and Reala ~Theme of a Tregedic Revenge~D'Force MasterAfter the DreamKnow Thyself!Sowing SeedsDREAMS DREAMSFragmented Nights[CR]Development History[CR]Shortly after completing work on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, future Sonic Team president Yuji Naka had a flash of inspiration on the plane ride back to Japan: What if a game captured the thrilling sensation of flight? This idea was shelved for many years as he continued work on games in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. After completing Sonic &amp; Knuckles, the team revisited the concept of flight for Sega's new Saturn game console, hoping that technology had advanced to the point where a game based around the concept would be feasible and enjoyable.Initial concepts involved a newborn baby bird who was just learning how to fly; over the course of the game, this character would grow stronger and learn how to fly more gracefully. This concept was scrapped after deciding it somehow resembled Sonic the Hedgehog too much. Eventually the concept of a graceful jester called NiGHTS in the dream world of Nightopia was decided upon. Hundreds of animations were created to convey the acrobatic sense of grace NiGHTS had, easily gliding through the air, defying the laws of gravity. To help control NiGHTS, SonicTeam simultaneously launched a new Sega Saturn analog joystick with NiGHTS into Dreams..., allowing players full control over NiGHTS' speed and direction.To flesh out Nightopia, Sonic Team designers actually studied dream psychology for many weeks, reading and comparing the works of psychologists like Carl Jung and Frederick Holtz for inspiration. Each level in NiGHTS was carefully constructed to reflect the apparent memories and emotions both the main characters had growing up.Yuji Naka frequently likened his feelings about NiGHTS: Into Dreams... to Steven Spielberg's own regarding E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial - that it is his "perfect" game. Much like Spielberg's aversion to making a sequel to E.T., Yuji Naka repeatedly stated that it would be difficult if not impossible to improve on the game's formula without tarnishing what made the original NiGHTS so unique and special. He maintained this position all the way up until quitting Sonic Team in 2006 to go start PROPE. Within less than a year of Naka's departure, Sonic Team announced they would be developing a sequel, called NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The genders of NiGHTS and its evil twin Reala are never openly mentioned; they are purposely left androgynous.A boss fight against a character called "Selph" was cut. Reportedly, Selph would be a mirror image of NiGHTS. The unused orchestral track "Know Thyself!" on the official NiGHTS Soundtrack is said to be the music for the deleted Selph boss.Despite NiGHTS existing only in a singular Sega Saturn game for many years, NiGHTS had a cameo in nearly every Sonic Team game produced following the release of the original Sega Saturn title, with appearances in Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Phantasy Star Online, Sonic Shuffle, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg, and more.NiGHTS was the debut of Sonic Team's ill-fated "Artificial Life" (A-Life for short) system. Each level in NiGHTS is inhabited by small pixie-like creatures called Pians. Pians freely move about the level, doing various activities on their own accord; singing, socializing, and generally having fun. NiGHTS can interact with Pians one of several ways: Killing them (which makes all Pians witness to the event very upset), or helping them to mate: by touching a Nightmaren, Pians lay special eggs, and from these eggs hatch hybrid Pians with characteristics of the enemy their parent contacted. Pians also have a secondary function: Depending on their mood, the tone of the music for that given level will change, with 20 total music variations present for each level in the game. If undisturbed, Pians naturally grow happy over time. However, if a Pian witnesses another being killed, they grow sad or angry.Many of the concepts included in Christmas NiGHTS were intended for this version of the game, and numerous features in Christmas NiGHTS can be used to analyze save files from the full version.A sequel known as "Air NiGHTS" was planned for the Dreamcast, but never came to fruition. Reportedly, the game would have used a gyroscopic motion sensor that slotted into the Dreamcast's VMU port.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (known in Japan as Vampire Hunter: Darkstalkers' Revenge) is a 2D horror-themed fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on April 6, 1995.The second installment of the Darkstalkers franchise (and the sequel to Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors), Night Warriors refines the gameplay (including playable boss characters, updated chain combos, new ground-based techniques, an "Auto-Blocking" character mode, and a revamped Special Meter system) while adding two new characters (the dhampir Donovan Baine and the jiangshi Hsien-Ko).The game's plot is a remake of the original, involving an invasion of Earth by the alien Pyron (which happen to take place during a tournament of "Darkstalkers" to see who is worthy to take over the Demon World). At the same time, the two new characters enter the fray as "Dark Hunters" (whose goal is to hunt down the other Darkstalkers, each for different reasons).The game was ported to the Saturn on February 22, 1996, featuring an "Appendix Mode" that allows players to switch between this game's version and the original game's version for certain background stages, character palette, and background music. The original version was also re-released in two compilations: the Japan-exclusive Vampire: Darkstalkers Collection (released for the PlayStation 2 on May 19, 2005) and the online-enabled Darkstalkers Resurrection (released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on March 12, 2013).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Screen Shot Showing the New Energy Bar.While keeping the basic fighting mechanics from the first game including Chain Combos, Crouch walking and air blocking, several refinements and, balance tweaks were made.The energy meter system from the previous game was replaced with a more traditional "stock" system similar to that of Street Fighter Alpha. This system allows you to save up energy to use at a later time.Also introduced in this game were recovery rolls and pursuit attacks. Pursuit attacks allowed a player to attack a downed opponent. While the recovery roll could be used to counter this new mechanic and "roll" out of the way of the attack ether towards or away from the opponent.Chain Combos where heavily modified, and now where called "Hunter Combos". This is a specific kind of chain combo where the player starts by hitting weak attacks and progress up to stronger ones of the same type. This same combo mechanic was later used in the newer Marvel vs franchise.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game features 14 playable characters, two of which are brand new and two of which are boss characters that were not playable in the original.Much like Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting and Super Street Fighter II Turbo, all of the characters' default color palette are changed to an alternate.Returning Playable CharactersCharacterMonsterCountryAnakarisMummyEgyptBishamonSamurai GhostJapanDemitri MaximoffVampireRomainaFeliciaCatwomanUnited StatesJon TalbainWarewolfEnglandLord RaptorZombieAustraliaMorrigan AenslandSuccubusScotlandRikuoMermanBrazilSasquatchSasquatchCanadaVictor Von GerdenheimFrankenstien MonsterGermanyNew Playable CharactersCharacterMonsterPyroAlienPlanet HelstormHuitzilAlien RobotMexicoDonovanDemon HunterUnknownHsien-KoChinese ZombieChina[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Off-World Interceptor was a third person game where you control an off-road vehicle traversing alien worlds and blasting hordes of enemies. The game is not so much known for its play, which was not bad but hardly amazing, but because it was one of the few to recognize that it's FMV sequences were rather horrible and tried to redeem them by instituting an MST3K-esque set of shadows (Doug Benson and Brian Posehn) at the bottom of the screen mocking it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Off-World Interceptor was an on rails vehicular combat game. The player could drive as far to the left and right as they wanted provided there wasn't an obstacle blocking their path but they could never turn around. The levels are fairly large for the time of the game's release and there was quite a bit of action going on at any given moment which would at times lead to a drop in frame rate. The player would be able to get power ups for all the weapons as well as money to buy new weapons, lives, and powerups in between missions. Vehicles had jump jets that allowed them to leap over certain obstacles, incoming fire, and enemies. Each level is timed, if the time limit expires the entire area is destroyed via bombs and the player must start the level over. At the end of each segment which is composed of multiple stages the player must fight a boss character which is followed by a cinematic sequence.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Olympic Soccer is a soccer game developed by U.S Gold and published by Eidos Interactive in lieu of the 1996 Summer Olympic games held in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The game is split into four main game modes for players to choose from, with standard Exhibition, Arcade, League modes included alongside a simulation of the Olympic competition from Atlanta in 1996.A tally of 32 teams are included in the game, with the 16 teams who qualified for the real life tournament at the Olympics as well as 16 developer selected teams. These range from eventual gold medallists Nigeria, hosts the USA, the un-qualified China and even a faux-England team (as England don't compete in Olympic competition as a single country). Additionally, player names were fake and not licensed for use.Up to four players can play the game through use of the Multitap accessory, with a two player mode being available for players without the eponymous extneral add-on. A computer-controlled demo of the game can be selected via the menu, showing two teams playing against each other without player input.The game features some unique commentary from radio-host Alan Green -- as evidenced by his "Whack!" exclamation when players would shoot -- as well as 18 different camera angles, motioned captured animations and polygonal object modelling in a real time 3D engine.Gameplay contains a few additions that set it apart from other luminaries of the time (Actua Soccer, Kick Off, Adidas Power Soccer), including the ability to alter the flight of a ball in mid-air, allowing for extensive curve, swerve and movement to allude goalkeeping AI. This ability could be classified as a 3D representation of the mechanic found in the popular Sensible Soccer franchise or the Xbox Live Arcade release Fitba, which pays homage to the former.The game also has several notable glitches, for example; if your player runs at a 45 degree angle to the corner of the box and shot, it is almost impossible for the goal keeper to save it, resulting in a goal more often than not. This glitch can be exploited to hang large scores on opponents. Also, shooting at the corner flag can also result in a glitched goal.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; "5 9 4" would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. [CR]Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</plot>

		<plot>Pandemonium is a platform game, originally for the Saturn, PlayStation and PC, and more recently has been ported to the N-Gage and iPhone.[CR][B]Storyline:[/B][CR]Nikki and Fargus reading from the Spell BookPandemonium is set in the world of Lyr, stars Fargus a joker and Nikki, a gymnast. Both are unhappy with their careers so they attend a lecture on wizardry, being held by Vu, in an attempt to learn magic to break free from their unfulfilling careers. The lecture does not teach them anything, but afterward they come across Vu's spell book. Despite the cover containing a warning, saying that only fully trained wizards should read from it, they ignore this, and start reading spells. They accidentally cast a spell causing a large green monster to completely destroy their hometown. They quickly decide on a plan to return the town to it's original state, and decide to go in search of the Wishing Machine, a machine that will grant any three wishes.Upon arrival at the Wishing Machine the machine grants them their three wishes. Fargus proclaims that they should wish for a million wishes, but the Wishing Machine tells them that it won't work. Fargus then wishes for a chicken, and a chicken appears. After Nikki asks why he did that, he says he wanted to see if it would work. Nikki then wishes for their home town to be restored to its former state. The Wishing Machine grants the wish and Nikki goes outside to find that the town had in fact been restored. Fagrus then comes outside and Nikki says they still have one wish left, where Fargus clumsily replies "I wish everyone was like us" . They then look out over the town and sees that everyone is identical to Fargus.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]While the game boasts technically proficient 3D graphics the gameplay happens on in a 2D plane. It is pretty standard 2D platforming in which the player must traverse environments and enemies to get to the end of the level. At the beginning of a level the player must decide whether to play as Fargus or Nikki. Fargus has a spinning kick move, while Nikki can do a double jump.There is treasure scattered throughout the level which the player can collect to gain bonuses. If the player collects 300 pieces of treasure they gain an extra life. If between 85% and 95% of treasure in a level is collected then a bonus platforming game is unlocked, and if 95% of treasure in a level is collected a bonus pinball mini game is unlocked.There are three power ups that Nikki and Fargus can obtain in level. The red power up allows them to shoot fireballs which can kill enemies with varying amounts of hits. The blue power up which allows them to freeze enemies who can then be shattered by being hit once more. The third is the green power up which allows them to shrink enemies. They can then be killed by by being stepped on.There are portals in some of the levels aswell, which turn the characters into different animals giving them special abililities. The frog can jump very high, the rhino can build up speed to charge at enemies and kill them the turtle can become invincible by hiding in its shell and the dragon can fly and shoot fireballs. Once the player has passed through a portal, passing through another one will change them back to normal.[CR]Magical Hoppers[CR]A drastically changed version of this game was released in japan under the name Magical Hoppers, and featured new anime style cut scenes, soundtrack and completely changed characters - Clam and Grumpy.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Panzer Dragoon</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panzer Dragoon was one of three North American launch games for the Sega Saturn on May 11, 1995. In this seven-level on-rails shooter, the player rides a dragon through the forces of an evil Empire in an attempt to save the world from oppression and the biological regulation of an ancient machine.[CR]Multimedia[CR]Featuring several ambitious and lengthy cut scenes throughout the story, Panzer Dragoon was nonetheless hampered by the Saturn's relatively unimpressive Cinepak video codec, which allowed for only low-resolution, low frame-rate video inside both a letter box and a pillar box (although the PC version obviously fared better in this regard).PC cut scene &amp; dialogueThe actual gameplay sequences, however, are full-screen with a very good framerate, and are quite respectable for the time. Panzer Dragoon is known for the wide variety of well-defined alien creatures, with many displaying flock-like group flight patterns and extraordinarily convincing movement on the ground, across the surface of the water, and through the air. Environments are varied, from crumbling cities on the water to the desert, with stages taking place at different times of day, both inside and outside. Despite the low-resolution texture maps, low polygon count objects, low draw distance, and lack of aliasing or lighting, the game creates a reasonable approximation of flight through a wide-open world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Radar shown on top rightIn this first game of the series, the player only flies along a preset path, with just enough freedom of movement to dodge bullets and other incoming hazards. In a departure from many rail shooters, the player has control of their perspective by looking around 360 degrees in 4 separate 90-degree chunks, controlled by the shoulder buttons. Shooting comes in two varieties: single shots, or the more powerful (but slower) bursts fired by holding down a button and passing over multiple targets, with the dragon withholding fire until the button is released.Checkpoints are few, if any, and may require the unsuccessful player to repeat half or all of the level. The later sequences become quite difficult, with enemies approaching from all sides, requiring the player to successfully identify threats from any direction, switch perspective to address the threat by dodging and returning fire, and still avoid obstacles and other oncoming threats as the dragon continues to fly along the preset path.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Panzer Dragoon snuck onto the scene with little fanfare, but showed that a well-done example of an existing idea (the rail-shooter) with enough well-implemented new and interesting ideas, from the Moebius (and Moebius-inspired) art design to the painted-target homing weapon to the player-controlled perspective, would resonate favorably with players. The Panzer Dragoon franchise went on to include not only more of the same polished action in the form of Panzer Dragoon II: Zwei, but also added traditional RPG trappings in the appropriately titled Panzer Dragoon Saga, which shipped on 4 CDs and was the franchise's final Saturn release; as well as the background of the "enemy" perspective and well-detailed story in the XBOX's 2002 visual tour-de-force Panzer Dragoon Orta.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The second Panzer Dragoon game is not a sequel, but a prequel to the first, and is also set in a post-apocalyptic world where mankind struggles against forces of nature, trying to re-build their civilization.[CR]The game follows the story of a boy named Lundi who lives in a frontier town. The area is populated by mutant animals called "khourieats". The town inhabitants see them as bad omens and kill them. One day Lundi finds a small khourieat with wings. Instead of killing it, Lundi decides to hide it and keep it as a pet. After his town was destroyed by an ancient weapon, Lundi sets out on a long journey with his pet, who will soon become a powerful dragon.[CR]Like the first game, "Panzer Dragoon Zwei" is a rail-shooter. The player follows a pre-set course and either uses Lundi's gun or the dragon's special abilities to dispose of the enemies. Lagi, that is the name of the dragon, can evolve during the game and gain more powerful attacks, which signifies a step towards a real RPG like  Panzer Dragoon Saga.</plot>

		<title_clean>Panzer Dragoon Saga</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panzer Dragoon Saga is a game made for the Sega Saturn by Team Andromeda and published by Sega. It was released in Japan on January 29, 1998, and in the United States on April 30, 1998. Panzer Dragoon Saga is the first and only RPG of the Panzer Dragoon series. The game spans four discs. Notably the entire first disc of the game was released as a demo in the PAL region.Due to the failure of the Saturn and the fact that PDS was one of the Saturn's last releases, the company did not produce many copies. Only about 30,000 copies were produced in total, making the game very expensive to come by today.The game is notable among console RPGs of its era in that every line of dialog is fully voice acted, mostly in Japanese. At the start and end of the game, the voice acting is done in a language made up for the series, often referred to as Panzerese.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The protagonist of the story is Edge, a young mercenary employed by the Empire. During the game's opening sequence, Edge is guarding an excavation site where ancient artifacts are being recovered for use by the Empire. After helping to fend off an attack from a wild mutant creature within the ruins, Edge discovers what appears to be a young woman buried in a wall. Before Edge has time to react the site is attacked by Craymen, the leader of a Rebel faction known as the Black Fleet. Craymen orders his troops to seize the girl, and Edge and his companions are shot. Edge falls into an underground reservoir deep within the ruins. Edge floats lifelessly in the reservoir until a mysterious light falls from somewhere into the water, reviving Edge. Confused but alive, Edge attempts to find a way out of the ruins. During his escape, Edge is rescued by a dragon that seems to be able to communicate with him using telepathy. Edge, incensed by the killing of his comrades, decides to take the dragon and exact revenge on Craymen. He is unaware of the magnitude of the events into which his desire for retribution has thrown him.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The battle system.Gameplay is Panzer Dragoon Saga is split into three distinct sections. When exploring towns and villages, the player takes control of Edge. The game uses a target system (similar to the previous entries in the series) to allow you to examine items and converse with people. When exploring environments outside of the towns, the player takes control of Edge's dragon. While these sections use very different controls to the on-foot sections, they utilise the same targeting mechanic to manipulate obects, open doors, etc. During flight sections, a radar display appears at the bottom of the screen. This display will change colour depending on how many enemies are nearby.All battles, excluding boss fights, are random encounters. However, Panzer Dragoon Saga's battle mechanics differ greatly from other contemporary Role Playing Games. All battles are fought in the air, which allows you to circle around your enemy. Many enemies have weak points that can only be attacked from certain angles, or special attacks that can only hit you from certain positions, so strategic positioning is important. In order to attack or use items, the player must use the action gauge, a bar at the bottom of the screen that charges when the player is stationary. Each attack or item will use between one and three action bars, depending on how powerful it is. This introduces an interesting dynamic to the battles, since players have to remain stationary in order to charge their attacks, but must move in order to dodge enemy attacks.Positioning plays a very important role in almost every fight in the game, from the lowliest random encounter to the mighty Atolm Dragon fights. The game provides you with a radar in the center of the battle menu, comprised of four areas. Each area will be colored (or not) to indicate the threat the enemies pose to the player in that location. A segment may be red, which indicates danger as the enemy is a strong threat, and will hit the player with a powerful attack. Alternatively the segment may be clear, in which the enemies pose moderate threat, and may unleash a light attack on the player, and finally green, in which the player is safe. Mixing up the system some what nearly all enemies will move around the player's dragon, making combat a dangerous vie for advantageous positioning.At the end of a battle the player's performance is ranked, based on how long the fight took and how much damage the player suffered, ranks vary from Excellent (the best rank) to Narrow escape (the worst). The rank attained by the player is stored in the bestiary alongside an entry on that opponent.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The music in Panzer Dragoon Saga was composed by Saori Kobayashi and Mariko Nanba and is one of the most praised aspects of the game. Sona Mi Areru Ec Sancitu, used in the end credits, featured vocal work from Eri Ito, a known Japanese singer and voice actress who has worked on the Japanese dubs for various Disney animations. The soundtrack was released in a variety of formats, the first was a disc that was included with a Demo Disc of the game released in 1997. The complete soundtrack was released in March 1998 along with the release of the game. A reissue was released in 2001 which include several remixes.Disc OneTrack NumberTrack NameLength01Ecce Valde Generous Ale (Behold the Precious Wings)1:3402First Battle1:1803Noble Rebel Army2:0704A Holy Nation of Deceit1:1905Solitary Battle1:5806Wings1:2007Seperated for Eternity1:5108Premonition of War5:1009Mutation1:4510Chaos Amongst the Silence2:3211Mutation II1:5412Giant Creature3:0713Rest1:4814Breath of Life1:4515The Blue Ruins0:4716Wandering2:4717Forbidden Land1:3318Pure Blood Seed3:2419The Black Fleet2:2020Rendevous with Destiny0:3021Atolm Dragon4:0122Spirit of the Dragon2:1623Forseen Encounter0:5824The Empire3:3325Shellcoof1:5726Zoah2:5127Paet's Theme3:3028Water Ruins2:4129Ancient Weapon3:27Disc TwoTrack NumberTrack NameLength01Trapped Underground1:2602Path to the Being3:4803Sealed Spirit1:2504Elevator Chase1:1405Giant Creature II2:0906Seperation0:3607Source of the Protective Flame3:0208Dream2:0309Sleeping Iron Ingot3:2910Imperial Air Force3:4311Giant Warship3:2312Fading Away1:1813Holy Chariot2:3214A Century Gone By2:3515Interception2:3916Awakening1:3917Conclusion2:2818Village of the Seekers2:4419The Forest's Cry3:3720The Red Ruins1:4021Into the Promised Land1:4522Overture to the End3:3123Tears1:4324Sestren1:0325Vision2:0026Vision II2:0227The Final Battle2:2428Soni Mi Areru Ec Sancitu (Art Thou the Holy One)4:11[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Pastel Muse is a puzzle game where you shoot colored balls down a slope to match them up with the pile of balls at the bottom. The premise is similar to such games as Puzzle Bobble, but with a difference. Here you not only control the aim, but also how hard you shoot the ball, making it go in an arc across the playing field and down the slope. Also, when you make balls disappear the remaining balls fall further down the slope using somewhat good physics.You can play the game in the usual Story Mode, vs Mode and Endless Mode varieties usually found in this kind of puzzler.</plot>

		<title_clean>Primal Rage</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Primal Rage is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994. Players control one of seven giant beasts (who are rendered in stop-motion animation) who must battle each other to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known in the game as "Urth"). Although not as popular as the also-violent Mortal Kombat franchise, the game spawned toys, comic books, and a novel, as well as many ports.A sequel (simply named Primal Rage II) was in development, but was canceled (though some early prototypes have been found). [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack. Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Fatalities (glorified execution moves that can only be performed at the end of the winner's winning round) are also performed in this way. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground (giving back some of the player's health). Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final battle to keep its place as "king of the hill". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish "dinosaur graveyard", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, he can immediately restore his initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues.[CR]Characters [CR] The character select screen with the seven playable characters.The game includes seven playable characters. (Six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) A final boss character was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped. Sauron and Diablo are palette swaps of each other, while Blizzard and Chaos are also palette swaps. (However, Diablo and Chaos are smaller than Sauron and Blizzard in terms of size) Sauron Talon Vertigo (not available in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) Blizzard Chaos Armadon Diablo[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Princess Crown is an action RPG developed for the Sega Saturn by Atlus in 1997. Featuring real-time combat mixed with typical RPG elements, Princess Crown is highly regarded as being one of the best looking 2D games on the Saturn with notably large sprites and fluid animation. The development team behind Princess Crown eventually left Atlus and founded their own studio in 2002 called Puraguru which would later be renamed to VanillaWare. The company has since create several games that are inspired by or are spiritual successors to Princess Crown, such as Odin Sphere, Muramasa, and Dragon's Crown. Princess Crown was later ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2005 by Atlus and featured a few extras such as an image gallery. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player takes the role of Princess Gradriel, heir to the throne of Valendia - the demon Larva, banished by Gradriel's mother 25 years hence, has re-awakened and is now once again threatening Valendia, so against her advisers wishes the young princess ventures out to dispel the demon forces from her lands and restore order.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Gradriel Do Valendia: The main character of Princess Crown. As the newly appointed Queen of Valendia, Gradriel sneaks out of the castle in order to better understand the kingdom she now rules.Edward Glowstar: The fairly tale's knight in shinning armor. Edward pops up in the story every now and again to lead a helping hand to Gradiel.Portgus Chrisford: A pirate who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, a lot like Robin Hood.Prosperpina: Just like Edward, Prosperpina pops in and out of the story at various points to cause trouble for our hero. She's not evil, but the first thing you see her do is her kidnapping kids and turning them into animals.Although Gradriel is the main character, you can play as the other characters in their stories after you beat the main game.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Puyo Puyo Sun</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo Sun is the third game of the Puyo Puyo series. Unlike the original (arcade) Puyo Puyo and Puyo Puyo Tsu, which were developed for Sega's Genesis-based System C2 arcade hardware, Sun uses the Saturn-based ST-V architecture. Sun adds a new mechanic, Sun Puyo, to Puyo Puyo Tsu's ruleset. It also allows players to select a character before a multiplayer battle.The emphasis on the sun is a pun based on the Japanese word for "three," san.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo Sun's core rules are identical to those of Puyo Puyo Tsu. Players are given a 12x6 field and must match 4 Puyo of the same color together to eliminate them. "Popped" Puyo send gray Nuisance Puyo to the opponent; Nuisance Puyo can only be erased by popping a set of color Puyo next to them. The opponent has a chance to eliminate Nuisance that is waiting above their field by creating a chain of their own; this is called "offsetting." The first player that cannot bring new Puyo into their field (this is caused by filling the third column from the left) loses.New to this game is Sun Puyo. A sun is located in the middle of the field; whenever a player offsets Nuisance Puyo, the sun turns red and glows. The sun will then drop Sun Puyo into their field; the player is warned of incoming Sun Puyo by beams of light that shine in the targeted columns. Sun Puyo offer bonuses to a player's score and, by extension, increases the number of Nuisance that the player will send to their opponent. Getting an All-Clear (clearing the entire field) also offers Sun Puyo; this replaces the Nuisance bonus that was given in Puyo Puyo Tsu.[CR]Single Player[CR]Like the original Puyo Puyo, Sun's single-player mode is split into Easy, Normal, and Hard; each difficulty features a different player character.EasyThe Easy route stars Draco Centauros, who seeks to enjoy the perpetual summer created by Satan.Skeleton THarpyChoppunNormal and HardThe Normal and Hard routes star Arle Nadja and Schezo Wegey, respectively; both want to fix the weather. Arle battles every opponent, while Schezo starts at Komodo Dragon. The Hard route, like the single player mode of the previous two entries in the series, increases the Puyo drop speed as the player advances.Draco CentaurosIncubusSuketoudaraKikimoraNohohoKodomo DragonWitchHoney BeeZoh DaimaohLagnus the BraveRulueSchezo Wegey/Arle Nadja (the character that is not chosen by the player)Satan[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo Sun is the third game of the Puyo Puyo series. Unlike the original (arcade) Puyo Puyo and Puyo Puyo Tsu, which were developed for Sega's Genesis-based System C2 arcade hardware, Sun uses the Saturn-based ST-V architecture. Sun adds a new mechanic, Sun Puyo, to Puyo Puyo Tsu's ruleset. It also allows players to select a character before a multiplayer battle.The emphasis on the sun is a pun based on the Japanese word for "three," san.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo Sun's core rules are identical to those of Puyo Puyo Tsu. Players are given a 12x6 field and must match 4 Puyo of the same color together to eliminate them. "Popped" Puyo send gray Nuisance Puyo to the opponent; Nuisance Puyo can only be erased by popping a set of color Puyo next to them. The opponent has a chance to eliminate Nuisance that is waiting above their field by creating a chain of their own; this is called "offsetting." The first player that cannot bring new Puyo into their field (this is caused by filling the third column from the left) loses.New to this game is Sun Puyo. A sun is located in the middle of the field; whenever a player offsets Nuisance Puyo, the sun turns red and glows. The sun will then drop Sun Puyo into their field; the player is warned of incoming Sun Puyo by beams of light that shine in the targeted columns. Sun Puyo offer bonuses to a player's score and, by extension, increases the number of Nuisance that the player will send to their opponent. Getting an All-Clear (clearing the entire field) also offers Sun Puyo; this replaces the Nuisance bonus that was given in Puyo Puyo Tsu.[CR]Single Player[CR]Like the original Puyo Puyo, Sun's single-player mode is split into Easy, Normal, and Hard; each difficulty features a different player character.EasyThe Easy route stars Draco Centauros, who seeks to enjoy the perpetual summer created by Satan.Skeleton THarpyChoppunNormal and HardThe Normal and Hard routes star Arle Nadja and Schezo Wegey, respectively; both want to fix the weather. Arle battles every opponent, while Schezo starts at Komodo Dragon. The Hard route, like the single player mode of the previous two entries in the series, increases the Puyo drop speed as the player advances.Draco CentaurosIncubusSuketoudaraKikimoraNohohoKodomo DragonWitchHoney BeeZoh DaimaohLagnus the BraveRulueSchezo Wegey/Arle Nadja (the character that is not chosen by the player)Satan[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Official screenshots often conveyed an atmosphere of chaos.Quake is an action-oriented first-person shooter developed by id Software and released on June 22, 1996. It is often cited as one of the most influential games in the genre, credited among other things with revolutionizing PC gaming with hardware accelerated true 3D graphics and bringing competitive multiplayer gaming to the masses. Its popularity spawned two official expansion packs ( Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity) in addition to laying the foundation for an extremely successful franchise. It would also go on to receive extensive support from its fan base in the form of numerous maps &amp; mods, whose creators in many cases would become successful game developers in their own right.Quake would also lead to several trends which would have an impact beyond the FPS genre. Arguably the origin of machinima, the Quake engine would be used to create films such as Blahbalicious and The Seal of Nehahra, movies which often had little or nothing to do with the game itself. Quake multiplayer became one of the first competitive games to be treated as an eSport, with skilled players such as Dennis "Thresh" Fong and Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel becoming gaming celebrities in Quake's limelight. Speed running site the speed demos archive was created after the release of Quake. The engine would later be licensed for use in various other products, such as Hexen II, X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse, and Half-Life, in addition to providing the foundation for the Quake II engine.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Though Quake is not a particularly story-driven game, the manual provides a basic setup for the events that transpire, which is noticeably similar to the backstory for the first Doom. While developing teleportation devices known as slipgates, a covert organization, presumably under the jurisdiction of the US military, makes contact with a hostile extra-dimensional being, codenamed Quake. Quake begins using Earth's own technology against it, teleporting his death squads deep inside the human installations which house the slipgates, leading to untold carnage and destruction. Fearing that the situation will soon become untenable, a commander involved in the project contacts the protagonist of Quake, an unnamed though highly skilled operative. Finding himself drafted into Operation Counterstrike, the protagonist is tasked with finding and stopping Quake by any means necessary. Not long thereafter, the installation is attacked, and the unknown soldier is left as the sole surviving member of Operation Counterstrike. He immediately resolves to seek out Quake on his own...Very little narrative is provided in-game, save for a few congratulatory sentences when a player finishes an episode. After gathering the four runes necessary to unlock the game's final confrontation, Quake is revealed to be Shub-Niggurath, a Lovecraftian elder god that exists as a massive faceless entity of flesh and writhing tentaces. The being is seemingly impervious to all damage, though the nameless soldier is able to defeat her by unorthodox means.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Difficulty settings are chosen in-game.Just like Doom before it, Quake is a fast-paced FPS with a linear progression of levels broken up into episodes. The objective of each level is simply to reach the exit, killing anything dangerous along the way. There are numerous obstructions to slow the player's progress, such as traps and locked doors which must be bypassed using buttons, keycards or keys. Despite these additional considerations, however, Quake is almost entirely focused upon "run and gun" first-person action. After each level, the player is presented with level statistics showing their total completion time as well as the number of enemies killed and secrets discovered compared to the maximum.Quake's four episodes can be tackled in any order, though there is an intended sequence. At the beginning of each episode, the player starts with only the Shotgun and the Axe, and weapons collected in each episode are not carried over to the next. Once the player has completed all four episodes and gathered the four magical runes within them, the pathway to Shub-Niggurath and the final confrontation is opened.Single-Player Maps &amp; Authors* indicates a secret level.Start: Introduction by John RomeroEpisode 1: Dimension of the DoomedThe mystical past comes alive...E1M1: The Slipgate Complex by John RomeroE1M2: Castle of the Damned by Tim WillitsE1M3: The Necropolis by Tim WillitsE1M4: The Grisly Grotto by Tim WillitsE1M5: Gloom Keep by Tim WillitsE1M6: The Door to Chthon by American McGeeE1M7: The House of Chthon by American McGeeE1M8: Ziggurat Vertigo* by American McGeeEpisode 2: The Realm of Black MagicAncient castles and strange beasts ahead...E2M1: The Installation by John RomeroE2M2: The Ogre Citadel by John RomeroE2M3: The Crypt of Decay by John RomeroE2M4: The Ebon Fortress by John RomeroE2M5: The Wizard's Manse by John RomeroE2M6: The Dismal Oubliette by John RomeroE2M7: The Underearth* by Tim WillitsEpisode 3: The NetherworldPrimal fear in a strange dimension...E3M1: Termination Central by John RomeroE3M2: The Vaults of Zin by American McGeeE3M3: The Tomb of Terror by American McGeeE3M4: Satan's Dark Delight by American McGeeE3M5: The Wind Tunnels by Tim WillitsE3M6: Chambers of Torment by American McGee &amp; Tim WillitsE3M7: The Haunted Halls* by American McGeeEpisode 4: The Elder WorldYour worst nightmares come true...E4M1: The Sewage System by Tim WillitsE4M2: The Tower of Despair by Sandy PetersenE4M3: The Elder God Shrine by Sandy PetersenE4M4: The Palace of Hate by Sandy PetersenE4M5: Hell's Atrium by Sandy PetersenE4M6: The Pain Maze by Sandy PetersenE4M7: Azure Agony by Sandy PetersenE4M8: The Nameless City* by Sandy PetersenEnd: Shub-Niggurath's Pit by John Romero[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Quake was one of the first games to include a client-server model for multiplayer, rather than a peer-to-peer model. Deathmatch, team deathmatch, and full cooperative modes were included at release. Quake actually included two multiplayer clients, and was one of the first games to include TCP/IP-based multiplayer that worked over the Internet. Unfortunately, the client that shipped with the game wasn't optimized for the high-latency and low-bandwidth of the dial-up connections common to the time. About six months after Quake was released, id software released an update, dubbed QuakeWorld, which utilized the UDP protocol and moved many tasks that had previously run on the server side to the client. This allowed online games consisting of 32 or more players to take place between players on dialup with relatively low latency. Tournaments all over the world still include Quake in their playlists, but most first-person shooters have since moved away from the unyielding speed and lethality of the original Quake.Quake has more realistic physics than Doom, but they are more vulnerable to abuse. Tactics such as bunny hopping and rocket jumping originated in Quake multiplayer. Skilled players can abuse Quake's physics to move faster than normal, and obstacles can often be bypassed effortlessly. These physics have been implemented as a feature in some modern mods, including Fortress Forever and Garry's Mod.Deathmatch Maps &amp; AuthorsDM1: Place of Two Deaths by Tim WillitsDM2: Claustrophobopolis by American McGeeDM3: The Abandoned Base by John RomeroDM4: The Bad Place by American McGeeDM5: The Cistern by Tim WillitsDM6: The Dark Zone by Tim Willits[CR]Mods[CR]Like Id Software's previous title, Doom, Quake had a very active modding scene, which was supported by Id with the release of SDK's, level editors and exhaustive information about the game's file system and the built-in scripting language QuakeC. These ranged from sound, model or texture replacements, additional levels, to total conversions, changing the core gameplay. Some of the earliest mods were Quake Rally, which turned Quake into a racing game with rather detailed vehicle physics for the era, and AirQuake, turning it into a third person multiplayer dogfighting game, with a large selection of real world jets.Other mods include:Painkeep (featuring new maps &amp; weapons, including exploding shells &amp; the chain lightening gun)Runequake (a serverside mod for multiplayer which gives players new abilities based on the runes they pick up)Slide (a hoverboard racing game)Kickflip Quake (a skateboarding game)Giana Sisters (a 2D platformer based on a Mario ripoff)Reaper Bot (Possibly the first bot ever made for a multiplayer FPS) Team FortressOne of Quake's most popular mods was Team Fortress, which was released in 1997 and turned it into a class, team and objective based multiplayer game. This spawned similar mods for other games and resulted in Valve acquiring the developers, having them create Team Fortress Classic for Half-life and later Team Fortress 2. The map 2forts has been one of the popular ever since the original mods release, and remains one of the most popular maps in Team Fortress 2.[CR]Speedrunning[CR]Speed Demos Archive, the largest provider of Quake speedrunningThe website Speed Demos Archive is the headquarters of Quake speedruns and speedrunners alike. The website has an extremely large library of quake speedruns of all kinds, and it was formally exclusive to Quake speedruns before later expanding to other games. However, Quake speedrunning is still a big part of Speed Demoes Archive and has its own massive section on the website. The section contains Quake speedrunning news as well as information on rules, contests, runners, contests, projects, and more.The website also features a section called "demos" which contains all the quake speedruns. The main runs are split up into three main categories: any%, 100%, and cooperative. The runs themselves are split up into several sub-sections including id Levels, Hipnotic Levels, Rogue Levels, Custom Episodes, and Custom Levels. The first 3 sections are for official levels created by the developer and the last two are for user created levels. Within each section is a list of all the levels featured in that section. The Cooperative section has different sub-sections: Easy Runs, Easy 100%, Nightmare Runs, Nightmare 100%, and Mad Coops (3 player runs).What is shown next to each level depends on the category. For example, in the "Run" (any%) category next to the levels name is the current easy any% record followed by the record holders name and next to that is the nightmare any% record followed by that record holders name. If the 100% section was chosen the any% best times would be replaced by the 100% best times. The Cooperative section works differently, if the "Easy Run" sub-section was chosen it shows record time for an easy 2 player coop run followed by the name of the runner. If Easy 100% was chosen it would be the same except the any% record time would be changed for the 100% coop record time and so on and so forth.Clicking on the link for a level provides further information that includes record time progression for easy any% run, easy 100% time, nightmare any% run, and nightmare 100% run in that order. Single player runs are shown first followed by multiplayer runs. The multiplayer runs can range from anywhere from 2 to 7 players, some levels have multiple multiplayer runs while others have none.There is a special fourth category titled "Marathon Demos". This section features single segment runs of whole episodes or the entire game/expansion pack. These runs are also have seperate categories for easy any%, easy 100%, Nightmare any%, and Nightmare 100%. In addition to this, the section also has cooperative runs and record time progression.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The weapons of Quake are a pretty straightforward affair, consisting almost entirely of point-and-shoot armaments with no alternate firing modes. In fact, the Grenade Launcher is the only ranged weapon in Quake that does not travel in a straight path toward its target. Despite this simplicity, or perhaps because of it, the Quake arsenal has become quite iconic, and the Rocket Launcher in particular is an object of affection for many Quake fans.AxeAxe One of Quake's two starting weapons, the Axe is the only melee weapon available, and is generally cannot be recommended unless there are no alternatives. Since almost all enemies possess ranged weaponry, getting close enough without taking damage is tricky. Even if one can close the distance safely, very few enemies are without a melee attack of their own, so there is no immediate advantage in most situations to bringing out the Axe.ShotgunShotgun The Shotgun, Quake's second starting weapon, presents a much more attractive alternative to the Axe, though it is only marginally more powerful. Firing six pellets at a time at a fairly steady rate, weaker enemies like the Grunt go down very quickly to the Shotgun, though it won't be long before heavier weapons are required. It has a much tighter spread than the Super Shotgun, making it the preferred weapon of the two when enemies are at medium to long range.Super ShotgunSuper Shotgun (aka Double Barreled Shotgun) Firing fourteen pellets to the Shotgun's six, the Super Shotgun not only deals a greater amount of damage per shot, but is also more efficient in terms of damage per shell. The trade-off comes in its range, as outside of close combat it is very unlikely that all pellets will hit. Still, closing the distance in order to maximize damage is often worthwhile. Many creature will perish under only a few volleys from the Super Shotgun, and shells are generally plentiful, making the SSG consistently useful.NailgunNailgun Capable of firing a steady stream of nails from its double barrels, the Nailgun is an accurate medium-damage weapon held back somewhat by the relative paucity of nail ammunition in the game. It is also less useful against extremely powerful enemies, as there are generally better options that don't require constant line-of-sight. The Nailgun can expend a full load in just twenty seconds.Super NailgunSuper Nailgun (aka Perforator) While it fires at the same rate as the Nailgun, each round from the Super Nailgun is twice as powerful. It also consumes ammo twice as fast, meaning sustained fire will drain a full clip of two-hundred nails in just ten seconds! Nevertheless, when dangerous enemies are afoot, the expedient damage provided by the Super Nailgun is quite handy, as long as each round hits.Grenade LauncherGrenade Launcher Fires a grenade in an arc that will either explode on contact with an enemy or detonate automatically after a few seconds. The simplicity of Quake's AI makes it a fairly simple matter to lay traps for enemies, and aside from having to account for the trajectory, it is just as useful as the Rocket Launcher. Though not as easy as rocket jumping, it is possible to perform grenade-assisted jumps in order to jump higher or increase one's speed.Rocket LauncherRocket Launcher The go-to weapon for both single-player and multiplayer, the Quake Rocket Launcher deals massive damage with its easy-to-aim explosive projectile and generous splash damage. In addition to its utility as a weapon, the Rocket Launcher became a popular means of assisted mobility in multiplayer and during speed runs, as "rocket jumping" allows players to launch themselves in almost any direction at incredible speeds.Lightning GunLightning Gun (aka Thunderbolt) Causing more damage per second than any other weapon, the Lightning Gun is a weapon that, like the Nailguns, suffers only from its limited ammo availability. It can take down any single-player foe in no more than two seconds, and even fully armored multiplayer opponents cannot survive it for long. It does requires a larger degree of precision than the Rocket Launcher, however, and overall it is the less sought-after of the two. Discharging the Lightning Gun underwater will expend all the player's cells, killing anything in sight, including the player.[CR]Items[CR]Quake items can be divided into two types: Health and Armor Pickups, which provide beneficial effects that are generally permanent, and Power-ups, which grant abilities in 30-second durations that are often extremely powerful. It is also worth mentioning that Quake marks the first appearance of Quad Damage, a power-up which would become synonymous with the Quake franchise.Health &amp; Armor PickupsHealth PacksHealth Packs The most readily available method of vitality recovery in Quake, Health Packs come in two varieties, which heal either 15 or 25 hit points. The two types can be easily differentiated from one another on sight due to the fact that the more powerful of them is much more brightly colored. Neither will heal the player past 100 hit points.MegahealthMegahealth Megahealth is the ultimate Quake health pickup, bestowing a full 100 hit points upon use which is capable of healing a player beyond the normal 100-point cap. While this is a powerful boon, it is also ultimately a temporary one, as any hit points in excess of 100 will gradually deteriorate over time. For this reason, it can be a good idea in single-player to pick it up when one's health is fairly low in order to avoid losing extra points.Green ArmorGreen Armor The most basic form of protection in the game, Green Armor provides 100 points of damage mitigation. Armor types in Quake not only come with different armor point totals, but also have varying degrees of damage absorption, which determines how quickly the armor is consumed. Green Armor absorbs 30% of all damage done to the player, meaning it has the slowest rate of consumption among Quake armor types.Yellow ArmorYellow Armor Yellow Armor provides 50 additional armor points over standard Green Armor (bringing the total to 150), but more importantly doubles the damage absorption rate to 60%. It is the most balanced of the three armor types, offering greater damage protection than Green Armor with slower consumption than Red Armor.Red ArmorRed Armor The pinnacle of Quake damage protection, Red Armor provides 200 armor points and an 80% absorption rate, which is enough to survive several direct hits from the Rocket Launcher. This superior mitigation comes with a cost, however, as Red Armor points are consumed at a much higher rate than other armor types.Power-upsBiosuitBiosuit Certainly the least exciting of Quake's power-ups, the Biosuit functions as a temporary means of underwater breathing and protection against hazardous liquids (though this does not include lava). It can be prudent to scan the environment for possible underwater passages before grabbing one, as Biosuits are usually included in levels for good reason.Pentagram of ProtectionPentagram of Protection Setting the player's armor value to 666 for the duration of its effect, the Pentagram offers the finest in demonic protection. Anyone under its power is completely immune to damage for thirty seconds, though curiously enough the Pentagram does not prevent the loss of armor points. While in effect, the player's screen is tinted a golden hue.Quad DamageQuad Damage True to its name, Quad Damage amplifies the strength of all attacks four times over, making even the lowly shotgun a weapon to be feared. Splash damage is particularly important to be aware of while using Quad Damage, as it is relatively easy to die suicidally by standing too close to the blast radius of a rocket or grenade.Ring of ShadowsRing of Shadows A rather overt reference to Tolkien's One Ring, the Ring of Shadows bestows its wearer with near-complete invisibility. The only visible portion of a player under its influence is the eyes, though in practice it is only possible to make monsters aware of your presence by firing on them. The Ring is useful for setting ambushes in multiplayer, or bypassing enemies altogether in single-player.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The enemies of Quake are a diverse bunch, ranging from rather mundane undead soldiers, to hideous yeti monsters and bouncing blue blobs. The only unifying trait is that they are all thirsty for blood, and the fairly simplistic Quake AI will compel them to pursue the player's death with little or no regard to their own safety. As in Doom, most Quake monsters can be coaxed into infights with one another, and maximizing the chances of this is one of the best ways to soften the game's difficulty.RottweilerRottweiler Seemingly an undead guard dog, the Rottweiler is quick on its feet, but none too strong. With only its bite for offense, it presents very little threat on its own, but if the player is distracted by other enemies, it can cause serious harm. When multiple enemy types are encountered, it is generally advisable to take out any Rottweilers first. Rottweilers are base-exclusive enemies, meaning they are never seen beyond the first level in each episode.GruntGrunt Low on both hit points and damage, the once human Grunt is the most basic bipedal threat in the realm of Quake. Two Shotgun blasts or a single round from the Super Shotgun is enough to take down a Grunt. To compensate for their general lack of punch, Grunts usually appear in groups where they can cause damage more quickly. The Grunt shotgun is also a hitscan weapon, meaning that it can only be dodged by breaking line-of-sight. Similar to the Rottweiler, the Grunt is considered a "base" enemy, and is not frequently found outside of the first level of each episode. Grunts drop a backpack with five shells when killed.EnforcerEnforcer The toughest of Quake's "base" enemies, the Enforcer is a burlier version of the Grunt in possession of a heavy blaster. While technically superior to the Grunt, its blaster fire is easier to avoid than the Grunt's shotgun since it is not a hitscan weapon, and is always fired in predictable two-shot bursts. They possess more than twice the hit points of a Grunt however, meaning the Enforcer will have more opportunity to cause damage before it is killed. Enforcers drop cells for the Lightning Gun upon death, which is odd considering they usually appear long before the player has access to the gun.KnightKnight Attacking quickly with a blood-soaked sword, the Knight does not possess a terribly large amount of hit points, but is often placed just out of sight in order to ambush a player upon entering a room. Like most melee foes, encountering them in the presence of ranged enemies can complicate matters. A good general strategy in this scenario is to fire at the ranged attacker while trying as much as possible to get the Knight caught in the crossfire. Knights will almost always lose in infight situations due to their meager hit points.Death KnightDeath Knight A much meatier version of the Knight that improves on the original with several times the number of hit points and a ranged attack as well. While it is generally a very tough foe, their ranged fireball attack is also one of the most consistent sources of monster infighting in the game, as it fires several projectiles in a wide spread that can provoke several monsters at a time. Exploiting this property can make many fights much easier.RotfishRotfish Quake's solitary aquatic enemy, the Rotfish contains no truly notable propensities. It simply swims toward the player in order to nibble away at their health. Most weapons, even the Axe, can handily deal with the Rotfish, though the Lightning Gun should be avoided for obvious reasons. Strangely enough, the Rotfish cannot be gibbed; this is also true of the Spawn, though in the case of that monster it can be explained by the fact that their death leaves no corpse.ZombieZombie One of the more unique enemies in Quake, the Zombie can only be permanently killed if it is "gibbed," meaning enough damage must be done to literally tear it apart. This is easiest to accomplish with the Grenade or Rocket Launcher, though other weapons can achieve the same effect if Quad Damage is involved. If a Zombie is killed without being gibbed, it will fall to the ground where it is invulnerable for a few seconds, picking itself up to resume its attack shortly thereafter with with renewed hit points.ScragScrag The Scrag is Quake's solitary aerial monster, and can be quite annoying, particularly on higher difficulties where it fires projectiles at a near-constant rate. If other enemies are present, a Scrag can be a major source of frustration. Nailguns are usually the weapon of choice when dealing with a Scrag, as it is often not possible to get close enough for a shotgun to be efficient, and explosive weapons are usually overkill with its low hit points.OgreOgre Possessing a fair number of hit points and a dangerous grenade launcher and chainsaw combo, the Ogre is a staple enemy throughout most of the game. While its grenades can be troublesome, particularly when engaging other enemies, they have one fatal flaw: they cannot adjust for height. An Ogre will fire at the same trajectory regardless of the player's elevation, which renders it totally incapable of retaliating when attacked from above. Perhaps in a show of loyalty to its master, the Ogre has the Quake logo emblazoned across its chest.SpawnSpawn One of the rarest enemies in Quake, the Spawn is a peculiar amorphous blue blob that bounces around the environment, attacking by colliding with the player. It is most dangerous when killed, however, as a Spawn explodes violently upon death. For this reason, it is more important with a Spawn than with other creatures to time one's killing blow in order to be outside its blast radius. WIth enough skill, it is possible to use the Spawn's splash damage to injure other creatures.FiendFiend A truly frightening creature that can leap great distances in order to eviscerate its opponents, the Fiend is the strongest melee-only monster in the game. It can be a great threat when combined with ranged creatures or other Fiends, and its is particularly good at staying in the player's face until it is killed. For this reason, it is generally preferable to kill Fiends first unless a greater threat is present, which is unlikely in most scenarios.VoreVore The Vore is a horrific spideresque creature capable of hurling purple firepods that are quite adept at tracking their targets. Because of the difficulty associated with dodging these firepods, a Vore is usually priority one in any encounter that does not include Shamblers. Their biggest weakness is their speed. With a very deliberate movement speed, simply running away is an effective way of mitigating their threat, as Vores cannot match the player's movement speed.ShamblerShambler With powerful claws and a deadly lightning attack, the Shambler is the most frightening opponent in Quake. In addition to having the highest hit points of any normal creature, the Shambler takes only half damage from explosives, meaning the Super Nailgun or the Lightning Gun are the best ways to deal with it. Its lightning attack is essentially a hitscan weapon, which means the only way to avoid it once it starts is to break line-of-sight with the beast. Monster infighting isn't very helpful in dealing with the Shambler either, as it can make short work of most enemies before they can do much harm.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]The bosses of Quake represent the game's most overtly Lovecraftian influences, as the names of both appear to be allusions to the Cthulhu mythos. While their behavior is no more complicated than that of Quake's normal monsters, neither can be defeated by normal means, requiring a special task be performed in order to kill them.ChthonChthon Situated at the end of Quake's first episode, Dimension of the Doomed, Chthon appears to be some manner of eldritch lava creature. Upon rising from the center of his chamber, Chthon begins to hurl explosive chunks of magma in a constant barrage, even when the player is out of sight. To stop him, players must utilize a contraption on the upper level of his chamber in order to electrocute him three times, at which point he will fall back into the lava.Shub-NiggurathShub-Niggurath The true name of the entity known as Quake, Shub-Niggurath is the horrific faceless monstrosity behind the slipgate incidents plaguing Earth. Like Chthon, she is immune to normal weapon damage. Though she does not actually attack, she is surrounded by several Shamblers and Vores that will defend her to the death. In order to kill the elder beast, the player must make a timed teleport jump inside the creature, which telefrags her. Perhaps not without coincidence, when viewed from the front Shub-Niggurath's tentacles seem to mimic the Quake logo.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Quake CD CoverQuake's original score was written and performed by Trent Reznor (credited as "Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails"); Reznor was also credited with creating the sound effects for the game. Trent was apparently a big fan of the original Doom games, which led to his collaboration with id Software on the soundtrack for Quake. As an in-game nod to him, the Nine Inch Nails logo appears on all of the game's nailgun ammunition boxes.The following tracklist shows the song titles as provided by official id Software sources.* The first "track" on the disc actually contains the game's data files.Track No.TitleRunning Time01[data track] *---02Quake Theme05.1203Intermission02.2804Start / Whispers08.2205Grisly Grotto06.0706Slipgate Complex07.2607Underearth08.4008Castle of the Damned05.3809Necropolis06.3110Ziggurat Vertigo03.3411Gloom Keep05.11[CR]Minimum System Requirements[CR]PCOperating System: MS-DOS 5.0 or higher (or Windows 95)CPU: 75 MHz Processor or better (math coprocessor required)Memory: 8 MB RAM (16 MB for Windows 95)Display: VGA compatible display or betterHard Drive Space: 80 MB disk space (40 MB for shareware)CD-ROM Drive: Double-speed (300k/sec. sustained transfer rate)AmigaCPU: 68020 + FPU (68060 recommended)Memory: 8 MB RAMGraphics Chipset: AGA, CGFX or Picasso 96 GFX boardHard Drive Space: 60MB[CR]Secrets[CR]Nightmare DifficultyIn the episode selection level, head up the stairs to the right to episode 4.While submerged in the water, move back towards the direction of the stairs until your back hits the wall and allow yourself to fall through.You should have landed on a wooden platform and you should see a doorway to your left.The path leads to the nightmare difficulty portal.DopefishDopefish can be found in E2M3: the Crypt of Decay [CR]Playing Quake on modern systems[CR]Many clients have been developed to provide an elegant solution for playing Quake on modern solutions.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rayman is a 2D platforming game developed by Ubisoft and has appeared on a range of different systems. It was first released on the Atari Jaguar and MSDOS in 1995, then released on the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn two months later. The game marked the debut of the Rayman series of video games.Rayman can also be found on the GameBoy Advance, under the title of Rayman Advance. It is also available on the US and UK Playstation Store and can be purchased for $5.99 and &#163;3.99 respectively. On the week of 7th December 2009 Rayman was released for DSiWare[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Rayman's world during the intro sequenceRayman lives in a peaceful world where the magical creatures and nature coexist with one another. It's not until Mister Dark, a cloaked villain claims the Great Protoon for himself and destroys the balance and harmony in Rayman's world. The electoons that orbited the Great Protoon were scattered across the land and locked in cages. It's up to Rayman to free the electoons and reclaim the Great Protoon stolen by Mister Dark so the world can live in harmony once more.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Rayman is a traditional 2D platformer that involves the player having to reach the end of each side-scrolling stage. Rayman has a health bar that can be increased from three hearts to six by collecting a special power up. If all of his health bar is depleted, Rayman will lose a life.At the beginning of the game, Rayman can't do anything besides walk and jump, but at certain points in the game he is given new abilities by Betilla the fairy. He will eventually be able to use his fists to punch at enemies, hang onto ledges and grab onto various objects, including swinging from floating loops in the air. He can also learn to fly for a short amount of time and also run when a button is held down.As Rayman explores each stage, he is able to collect small blue objects called Tings. He can offer them to the Magician, who can give Rayman access to special bonus stages. Collecting one hundred Tings will also award Rayman with an extra life.The main aim of the game is to collect every single electoon in the stages throughout the game. Every stage has six electoon cages hidden, which need to be found in order to access the final stages and the final boss battle.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]There are many different versions and releases of Rayman. The game's development goes as far back as the Super Nintendo. Due to a shift in technological advancement, the 16-bit platforms were becoming financially unfeasable and bieng overshadowed by newer platforms, giving way for more advanced hardware. After skipping platforms such as the Sega 32X, Rayman would finally make it's debut on a cartridge based system.Rayman (Jaguar)Story sequences were told through stills in the Jaguar version.The very first version of Rayman was released on the Atari Jaguar has several differences and features not seen in any other version of the game ranging from level design, presentation and more. For example the Moskito flying stages were shoot-em-up stages where the Moskito shot a laser from it's beak to defeat enemies. While it was altered for future versions of the game, this gameplay design would later be seen in Rayman Origins years later. Story elements were told through still images and artwork but still carried the same basic plot featuring Mr. Dark and the protoons. This is also one of two versions of Rayman that features a breakout clone. During development, the game also featured artwork and sprites representinglimbs for Rayman but were cut from the final version due to technical limitations and cartridge space which became an important factor in Rayman's character design.Rayman (Playstation 1, Sega Saturn and MS-DOS)The advancement in hardware provided several benefits for Rayman, none of which involved limbs.Due to the failure of the Jaguar platform, Ubisoft was quick to release the game for the launch of disc based systems. Because of the additional space and longer development time, the developers were able to add in higher quality sound and CD based redbook audio for the music giving way for speech, orchestrated music and even full motion video. Levels were refined and in some cases made even harder than the original version. This version would become the base for future releases of Rayman on modern consoles and handhelds. The MS-DOS version also saw various re-releases usually bundled with a level designer. The Playstation 1 version is currently available for purchase for Playstation 3, Portable and Vita systems through the Playstation Store.Rayman Gold (MS-DOS)The game was released on the PC on 28 September 1997. Along with the original game, this package contained the Windows-based Rayman Designer, allowing players to design and create their own levels and then share them with others via the internet. The game also contained 24 new, original levels; these had the same gameplay, but featured some new concepts and gameplay elements including collecting differently colored Tings that allow Rayman to progress in a level by opening paths. Other features were added such as event-triggering Tings, additional objects and a level timer to see how fast the player can finish the level.Rayman Forever (MS-DOS)Around a year later a second PC version was released. Featuring the same content as Rayman Gold along with with 50+ new levels over the original and a fridge magnet. Various sections of the soundtrack were erased to save space on the disc. This version is also available through GOG.com.Rayman Collector (MS-DOS)A final variation of the DOS version with 60 additional levels.Rayman Advance (Game Boy Advance)Limited cartridge space caused the developers to compress the graphics to pixelated detail.Digital Eclipse and Junglevision Software developed Rayman Advance which was released on the Game Boy Advance at the system's launch to capitalize on the system's 32-bit processor. The game was made easier to accommodate for the smaller screen by giving Rayman an extra hit-point and making certain sections easier to progress through. The game also did not reset the Ting score once a life was lost giving players better chances at obtaining extra lives. Because of the limited cartridge space, the game's graphics were compressed, music was adapted into a midi-like format and sound effects became tinny or non-existant in the port.Rayman (Nintendo DSi)The DSi version has the second screen show a map of the entire level that can scroll independently from Rayman by dragging the stylus on the touch screen.Making Fun and Junglevision Software developed the Nintendo DSi version for Nintendo's DSiWare digital download platform and also available in the eShop for Nintendo 3DS systems. The game was made even easier by using the same alterations as the GBA port received excluding graphical and audio compression, and Rayman is given between six to ten hit points depending on conditions and thirty continues. Some of the audio tracks taken from CD versions of the game, sound effects are low in pitch, and the game makes use of several features of the system. The inner Nintendo DSi camera will take a picture each time a checkpoint is used. The touch screen displays the entire map that can be seen by dragging the stylus in any direction and highlights key objects through the level such as Rayman's position, checkpoints and end level signposts. It also includes an achievement system that determines when a world is completed, when all the Electoons are freed and if the player has not used a continue.[CR]Game Boy Color Version[CR]The Game Boy Color version features all-new levels separate from the 32-Bit Rayman.Rayman for Game Boy Color, while similar in plot and environments, is actually a different game, however it also borrows elements from Rayman 2 as the game was released well after the original Rayman. The game follows a similar, linear progression where Rayman must free Protoons, some of which that cannot be found until Rayman has located power-ups. The only way to go back to free cages in previous levels is to complete the game which unlocks a world map. The game is also one of the few to feature the Ubi-Key which makes use of the Infrared sensor that is cross compatible with other Ubi-Soft published Game Boy Color titles. Keys found for Rayman would unlock hidden levels that cannot be obtained otherwise.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]486/33 (minimum);Pentium (recommended);Windows 95;DOS version 5.0 (minimum);2x CD-ROM drive (minimum);4MB RAM (minimum);8MB RAM (recommended);VLB Graphics card 256 colors (minimum);Sound Blaster compatible sound card;700MB free hard drive space;Mouse &amp; Keyboard.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Real Bout Fatal Fury (known in Japan as Real Bout Legend of the Hungry Wolf) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on January 26, 1996.The fifth installment of the Fatal Fury series, Real Bout Fatal Fury revamps on the game engine used in Fatal Fury 3 by changing its control scheme (including standard Punch and Kick buttons, a "Strong Attack" button, and a dedicated "line change" button) and introducing a new Power Gauge (allowing players to perform special counter-attacks and super moves). The bosses from the previous game are now part of the main roster, along with three fighters from previous games (Duck King, Billy Kane, and Kim Kaphwan). Real Bout Fatal Fury is also the only game in the series to feature ring-outs.Set after the events of Fatal Fury 3, crime boss Geese Howard organizes another "King of Fighters" tournament (after coming back "from the dead"), hoping for a fateful rematch against his adversary, martial artist Terry Bogard.The game was ported to the  Neo Geo CD, (on February 23, 1996), Saturn (on September 20, 1996 in Japan only), and  PlayStation (in 1997 for Japan and PAL regions only). The original Neo Geo version was also released in the  Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2 compilation for the  PlayStation 2 and was digitally released on the Wii (via  Wii Virtual Console) on December 13, 2012. The PlayStation version was digitally released on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on May 30, 2007 in Japan only. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Although much of the control mechanics in this game return from Fatal Fury 3, there are big differences. Each player now has three attack buttons (punch, kick, and strong attack) and one button to control the "oversway" system. Real Bout Fatal Fury also revamps the desperation move system and introduces a power gauge, which allows the player to use one of three special techniques: guard cancels (when the gauge is half full), desperation moves (when the gauge is filled), and hidden desperation moves. Players who have a full power gauge and less than half of his life gauge will trigger "P. Power" mode, where the power gauge will gradually drain and allow the player to execute as much guard cancels and desperation moves as he likes, as well as execute the hidden desperation move. Guard cancels do not use up any portion of the power gauge.Real Bout Fatal Fury is the only game in the Fatal Fury series to feature the concept of ring-outs. When the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while the opponent is next to certain boundaries, those barriers would eventually break, causing an instant lose for the player that falls off the boundary.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Contents of the game, including a cloud box overlay and braille card.Real Sound: Kaze no Regret ("The Wind's Regret") is an audio game released for the Sega Saturn by Japanese studio WARP, Inc. and directed and produced by the company's founder Kenji Eno. The game was released on June 15, 1997. The game was re-released for the Dreamcast in 1999 with a visual mode that included pictures and photos to accompany the story, but this version of the game also relies entirely upon sound and audio cues for gameplay.The game came as a result of contact that Eno had with blind and visually impaired fans of WARP games. Eno was fascinated that the visually impaired would be fans of his games. He thought his games were very visually rich. He even went so far as to contact some of these fans to find out how they played his games if they could not see the games. As a result Eno decided to make a game that would be audio only, with no graphics at all.Real Sound: Kaze no Regret was a very large influence on further games from Kenji Eno and WARP, Inc. Games that came afterward from the company would take gameplay elements from Real Sound. Enemy Zero featured invisible enemies that could only be through sound. D2, also from WARP, included parts of the game where the player's character was rendered blind and the player must rely on sound, following a voice to get through the game. D2 also featured a sequence where the character was rendered deaf.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret's story and plot revolve around a love story; the love story between Mizu Sakura and Hiroshi Nonoiti. The two characters meet while still very young in school and fall in love. Mizu and Hiroshi decide to meet one evening to elope. Mizu does not show up at the clock tower where they planned to meet and shortly afterward is transferred to a new school, separated from Hiroshi. The two characters meet coincidentally again. The game continues to follow the characters as Hiroshi is a college student and as Mizu is looking for a job and is starting her career.The game features the voices of Ai Maeda, an anime voice actress, and Miho Kanno, a Japanese actress and idol singer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret is a completely spoken and audio game, as a result the game's game play elements were unique and different than most games that came before it. The player would listen to the game's story, similar in manner to a radio play, and would be prompted at particular times to make decisions in the branching storyline. These decisions would be prompted by an audible chime. Some have described the game play as almost like an audio "choose your own adventure" game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Real Sound ~The Wind's Regret~ The MusicThe soundtrack to Kaze no Regret was composed by Keiichi Suzuki, who is most known for his work on the MOTHER series. It was distributed by Pony Canyon and released August 20, 1997. The song 'Takeyama's Wanderings' was written by Kenji Eno.Real Sound ~The Wind's Regret~ The MusicTotal length: 70:55The Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Piano VersionA New NostalgiaThe Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Quartet VersionLet's Go by TransportHer Name is IzumiAn Empty PlaceMorning SaxophoneWas It the Same DreamHer Name is AsamiWeather Forecast 1Weather Forecast 2Weather Forecast 3Weather Forecast 4Izumi's Question MarkWhat a Fool I Am (Ambient Version)A Sad and Beautiful TimeThe Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Piano Version by NanaIzumi's SuspicionNana RunsTakeyama's WanderingsFragments of NostalgiaNostalgic AmbienceCardboard songDriving HighWhat a Fool I AmThe Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Orchestra VersionRegret[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret was to be the first game in a three part trilogy of audio only adventure games to be created by WARP. The second game in the series was to be titled Real Sound: Kiri no Orgel ("Mists of the Music Box"). Advertisements even appeared for the game in some Japanese video game magazines. The game was under development by the company but was never completed supposedly due to problems with voice and sound compression. The game was to be a horror game.The third game in the Real Sound trilogy was to be a comedy game, Spy Lunch. The game never made it past the planning stages and development never fully began.Real Sound: Kaze no Regret to this day is still very popular with the visually impaired and the blind as it is one of the few such video(?) games ever released.One branch of the possible storyline for Kaze no Regret was broadcast in its entirety on the radio in Japan.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Resident Evil is a survival horror game developed by Capcom and first released in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A critical and commercial success when released, it paved the way for several sequels spawned across multiple platforms, novelizations and even movies. It also popularized the term "Survival Horror" when Sweet Home invented it.In 2002, Capcom decided to revamp the original game for the Nintendo GameCube. The GameCube being more powerful than the original PlayStation, the developers at Capcom were able to upgrade the game in such a way that over ''75%'' of the final product was different than the original game.Resident Evil is credited for coining the term "survival horror" and popularizing the genre. GamePro listed Resident Evil among the 20 most important games ever made. Game Informer also referred to the original Resident Evil as one of the most important games of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] &amp; ControlsResident Evil features many 'gotcha' momentsResident Evil is a classic survival horror game of the era, similar to the Alone in The Dark series, mixing in third-person combat, exploration, and puzzles. Like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible.While the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the player is allowed to explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of the puzzles and necessary key items required to move on can be solved/collected in any order.Utilising the notorious ''tank controls'', players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming.The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.Playable CharactersRebecca Chambers and Chris RedfieldResident Evil features two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from. Each offers up a different take on the same narrative, though what separates them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine's version of the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris'.Jill has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional weapon exclusive only to her story, being the bazooka; she has with her a lockpick that can open locked drawers and doors that would ordinarily require the Sword Key; and many more such examples. Chris' one primary benefit is that he is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage before succumbing to death.Each character also has their own unique supporting character that they will often encounter and interact with during the game. Jill Valentine has with her fellow STARS Alpha team member Barry Burton, whereas Chris has the rookie medic of STARS Bravo team, Rebecca Chambers. Both Barry and Rebecca will sometimes have to help the player character from a perilous situation, though Barry will always be an NPC. During Chris' story, however, players may take control of Rebecca Chambers on two separate occasions to help save Chris from dying of poison, and to kill the mutated plant monster Plant 42.InventoryJill Valentine's inventory screenDepending on which character the player chooses, they will either have six (Chris) or eight (Jill) inventory slots in total. Each type of item requires only one slot, however. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid SpraysA character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine - The character is in good-to-moderate health.Caution - The character is roughly at half health.Danger - The character is approaching death.Poison - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Characters can use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.Red Herb - On its own does nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.SavingResident Evil requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersChris RedfieldOne of the two main playable characters, Chris is the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team point-man, and is an exceptionally skilled marksman having won trophies for his skills with handguns. Having also served in the US Air Force before his time with S.T.A.R.S., Chris has some experience with combat. However, none of any such prior encounters could have prepared him for the nightmare he is about to endure.Jill ValentineThe second of two main playable characters, Jill is the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team's machinery expert. Couple her expertise handling such tools with her experience as apart of the US Army's Delta Force training program (specialising in bomb disposal) despite only being 23 years old, Jill has managed to gather an already impressive array of skills.Barry BurtonOne of the oldest and most experienced S.T.A.R.S. members, Barry is apart of Alpha team and is also the unit's weapons specialist. A close friend to Chris Redfield serving in the same Air Force unit, Barry is the man who managed to persuade him to join S.T.A.R.S. once he left the air force. As a family man with a wife and two daughters, despite Barry's expertise, he is actually a very friendly and trusting individual.Rebecca ChambersThe youngest member of S.T.A.R.S. at only 18, Rebecca is the team's medic assigned to Bravo team. Downtrodden after the majority of her comrades have died, she is now more than ever determined to aid the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members and use her medical abilities to help as much as she can. Outside of such horrific situations, Rebecca is a chirpy and highly motivated individual who is both more mature and capable than her age and rather petite size may suggest.Albert WeskerAlpha team Captain and the founder of the entire S.T.A.R.S. unit, Wesker is a well respected officer of the law and is looked upon with admiration by his fellow S.T.A.R.S. members, such as Chris Redfield in particular.PlotJuly 24th, 1998. Raccoon City. There have been several reports of murder within a small town in the midwest. Each victim is attacked by a group, leaving signs of cannibalism. The local law enforcement dispatches S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team to investigate the circumstances. Bravo Team, however, swiftly disappears and it's up to the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team to investigate both the grisly murders and find their missing counterparts.While flying over a small patch of forest along the outskirts of Raccoon City, Alpha Team spots Bravo Team's helicopter, smoldering on the forest floor. After landing, members of the Alpha Team head out to check the damage while the pilot, Brad Vickers, stays behind. It is quickly discovered that there are no signs of survivors at the crash. Shortly after the investigation starts, a severed hand is found, clutching a handgun. Soon, Alpha Team is ambushed by strange, powerful canine assailants. While fighting them off, Joseph Frost, one of the Alpha Team's members, is taken down and eaten alive. Vickers quickly fires up the helicopter and takes flight, leaving his team members to the horrors below. Chris Redfield spots a large mansion and orders the team to make for the doors.Jill and Barry working together.Alpha Team has been narrowed down to only four members within a large, strange mansion and surrounded by undead dogs outside the large double doors. While taking a status report, the team hears a gun shot from another room. Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, depending which character the player chooses at that point, moves on to check the source. Kenneth Sullivan is discovered overtaken by a zombie as it tears his head off with a vicious, hungered bite. After dispatching the shambling, living carcass, the player character is thrust into a mansion filled with several mind-bending puzzles, a few deadly traps, and dozens upon dozens of zombies with all hope of finding a living being lost.The mansion, while not completely abandoned, still hosts several files and diaries that catalog the events leading up to the manifestation the Alpha Team has discovered that evening. It is soon realized that the Umbrella Corporation, a powerful bioengineering pharmaceutical company, has taken control of several illegal experiments somewhere within the mansion. The results of which are the walking dead, animals, insects and all other living forms infected by the highly contagious mutagenic biological agent, the T-Virus.After traversing and solving the secrets of the mansion, Chris and Jill find themselves within an underground laboratory, the source of Umbrella's scientific research. One of the surviving members of Alpha Team, Albert Wesker, reveals himself as a traitor, working for the Umbrella Corporation all along. He then releases Tyrant T-002, one of Umbrella's more clandestine experiments, created with intense exposure to the T-Virus mutigen. The Tyrant soon turns on Wesker and knocks him out cold. Then it's up to Chris and Jill to destroy the monster and evacuate. A self destruct is issued, sounding an alarm through the entire laboratory.The tyrant.Chris and Jill make their way to the heliport to call for Vickers' chopper. As the helicopter flies into view, the Tyrant tears through the heliport, returning with a vengeance. After a brief battle, the pilot drops a rocket launcher to Chris and Jill, who quickly use it to blow the Tyrant to shreds. The surviving members of Alpha Team (and Rebecca Chambers, the sole survivor of Bravo Team) climb aboard the helicopter before the mansion and laboratory are completely destroyed.Alternate EndingsNot only depending on which main character the player chooses, the endings of the game can also be determined by specific choices made throughout the game based on which characters manage to survive.During Chris' story, he can meet Rebecca chambers under a couple of different circumstances. The most common introduction is in the first floor medicinal save room. Once introductions are established, Rebecca asks Chris whether she can explore the mansion with him. If players choose yes, Rebecca won't actually tag along with Chris but this will affect certain scenarios later on. If players choose no, she will reside within the save room and players can visit to have their health fully healed up to three times.If players allowed her to travel freely in the mansion, whence returning after exploring the Residential building, Rebecca is forced into an encounter with a Hunter and screams for help; if the player can't reach her quick enough, she will die. If she was told to wait in the save room, Rebecca is assured to survive. If she survives, then Rebecca will be able to set the bomb to destroy the mansion, triggering the resurgence of Tyrant on the Helipad.Jill Valentine can also be left behind (and potentially killed for certain if Rebecca is still alive by that point) if the player isn't able to find the 3 MO discs required to unlock the door to her cell, and vice versa when playing as Jill herself.Barry's betrayalDuring Jill's story, in order for Barry to survive players must establish a sense of 'trust' with him. This is firstly done by waiting for him to 'get another rope', during when Jill rappels down in the hole after killing Yawn. Afterwards, players will encounter Barry again in the underground caverns and he will ask to tag along with Jill. If Jill allows him to accompany her, this will then result in Barry returning to thwart Albert Wesker and safely escaping the mansion. If these requirements are not met, he will be found beaten and bloodied near the Umbrella Laboratory emergency escape and will die of his wounds. If Barry survives the encounter, which sets in motion the outcome of Wesker escaping and setting the Mansion to self-destruct, this triggers the ambush by Tyrant on the Helipad.Overall there are technically eight endings in total dependant on which combination of characters managed to survive the Mansion Incident.Chris' Story:Chris, Rebecca, and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.Chris and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.Chris and Rebecca survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.Chris survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.Jill's story:Jill, Barry, and Chris survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.Jill and Chris survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.Jill and Barry survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.Jill survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.The canon ending of Resident Evil is again made up of varying factors across both stories, including the survival of Chris, Jill, Barry, and Rebecca, the destruction of the Mansion, and the hatred Wesker grows for Chris.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Survival KnifeConsidered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little damage and has dangerously small reach. Because of its low effectiveness, it is usually best for the player to just run or attempt to avoid the enemy rather than combat it. Chris and Jill each wield their knife differently, though there are otherwise no differences speaking for their effectiveness.HandgunJill Valentine's starting handgun, which Chris Redfield also eventually procures as his pistol as he lost his in the forest. The beretta is the weapon of choice to handle lesser enemies such as zombies and Cerberus dogs.ShotgunA reliable pump-action shotgun. While it'll ordinarily take three shots to kill a zombie, players can alternatively aim up and shoot when the zombie is close enough to destroy the head killing it completely. Acquiring the shotgun can differ slightly between Chris and Jill. Because collecting the shotgun will instigate the ceiling trap, Chris therefore requires the Broken Shotgun item to trade in its place. However Jill may potentially be able to collect it without the need for the Broken Shotgun.Should Jill collect the shotgun, Barry will then arrive to save her from the trap. Though only if the player didn't meet Barry prior when finding the corpse of Forest Speyer, otherwise Jill will then require the Broken Shotgun item.Colt PythonAn incredibly powerful magnum-revolver, most recognizable as Barry Burton's weapon of choice. Simply massive in size, the Python is the second most powerful weapon in the game behind the Rocket Launcher. It can kill all lesser enemies with just one shot and is a reliable contender against boss battles. Though as one may expect, ammunition is terribly scarce.BazookaA weapon exclusive to Jill Valentine, the Bazooka is a powerful and diverse weapon that has access to a small variety of grenade types. There are the regular explosive grenade rounds, which do a sizeable amount of damage against just about anything; flame rounds, which while powerful, are especially effective against such creatures as Plant 42; and acid, which is the most powerful variant and is especially useful against Hunters.FlamethrowerOnly find in Chris's campaign, the flamethrower functions as both a weapon and a puzzle item, as the player requires it to trigger the unlocking of certain doors in the underground caverns. When used as a weapon, it's decent at staving off Hunters as the continuous spray will cause the Hunter to rapidly flinch. Fuel quickly depletes, however, and no more can be found. A second flamethrower is also conveniently left outside the area where the player faces against the giant spider queen, Black Tiger. Once the player moves on from the underground sections, they cannot take the flamethrower with them as it is required to unlock the way out.Rocket LauncherInitially only available during the final encounter against the T-002 Tyrant, it can also be unlocked with infinite ammo if players complete the game under 3 hours. As one may expect, the Rocket Launcher is able to kill every enemy and boss (minus the Tyrant during the helipad fight) with a single shot.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]ZombiesThe staple of the older Resident Evil games, zombies are of course as prominent as ever in the original Resident Evil and make for the primary combatant . Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick. The sure way to note that a zombie, or any other enemy, is definitely dead is the pool of blood that forms from underneath the corpse.Should a zombie fall to the ground and then proceeds to get back up, they will be completely invulnerable to all attacks during the animation period of such an action.Cerberus DogsAlongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Chris and Jill are just ever so slightly faster than the canines.CrowsAs always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They are always found to be in a large number, however, and can be very hard to avoid. They only have one attack by way of pecking at the player, which while does little damage will keep the player stuck in a short animation of trying to wave them off.Web SpinnersGiant, hairy spiders, the Web Spinners are a tenacious foe across Resident Evil, though they primarily appear only briefly within the Residential building. They can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though the base damage it inflicts isn't quite as alarming.Web Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Bazooka - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they've been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them all gone.HuntersFirst appearing once players return to the Mansion after investigating the Residential building, Hunters will then replace the common zombies of the game and will be encountered throughout in most areas where the zombies originally populated. Hunters are extremely dangerous and one of the most antagonising enemies throughout the franchise, let alone Resident Evil. They attack using their sharp claws and their most common source of attack is to leap through the air and slash the player; they are also invincible during the animation of leaping through the air. Their other attack is to simply slash at the player, though while the damage it does isn't quite as dramatic as the leap, it can be difficult to avoid. The speed of the attack could also result in players consecutively falling prey to the attack.Should the character's health be in the Lime Green Fine state or lower, however, the Hunter's leap will be replaced with a swift cleave which will decapitate the character killing them instantly. Hunters take one, sometimes two, shots from the Colt Python, which makes for the most suitable weapon. Otherwise the Bazooka, and even the shotgun, can do the job if there's enough distance between the Hunter and the player. However Hunters are almost always encountered in groups of at least two.ChimeraEncountered only within the secret underground laboratory, Chimera are wretched creatures made up of both human and fly DNA. Like Hunters, these too were artificially created by Umbrella themselves, though they apparently proved to be unreliable and not as effective as the Hunter B.O.W. They primarily function like a cross between Web Spinners and Hunters; Chimera's can scuttle across flat surfaces, and will usually try to slash the player from above, but will also land into the floor and give chase. From this stage, Chimera's may possibly leap onto the character's back and slice them from there.They can be relatively easy to avoid, however--especially if they've following whilst on the ceiling--and are rather weak as well, taking only around 2-3 shotgun rounds. Though much like the Hunters, Chimera are rarely encountered alone and they will sometimes attempt to swarm the player by attacking from two different directions.AddersHighly aggressive poisonous snakes, Adders can be found throughout the Mansion garden and will drop from the trees landing in front of the player. The damage they do is minimal, though there's a chance they can poison the player and there's often a large number of them at that. Running past them is the best option, though if combat should come into it, they will die by but a single handgun shot.WaspsFound in the Residential building, a sizeable wasp cocoon has formed within. The wasps themselves do very little damage and die with at most 2 shots from a handgun, however they will spawn within the room indefinitely.[CR]Boss Battles[CR]Yawn Part IA monstrously huge snake that resides within an attic, Yawn will surface once the player enters in search of a crest. This battle is completely voluntary, however, as the player can attempt to just collect the crest and escape. Because of the snake's size, this can sometimes prove difficult to maneuver throughout the environment. If the player is bitten there's a high chance that they'll be poisoned. If the player is poisoned, the character will pass out once they escape the room.As Jill, she will pass out and fall to the ground, with Barry arriving soon after who will take her to the first floor save room. This is all done instantaneously amidst a black screen, however, and Jill will wake up to find Barry gone. As Chris, he too will pass out just as he leaves the area and will be greeted by Rebecca Chambers. However in this occurrence, the player may have to take control of Rebecca to then go and collect the serum from the first floor medicinal save room for Chris. This must be done within around 7 minutes, otherwise he will die and the game will be over. Rebecca may alternatively arrive and the game will fade to black, with Chris waking up in the first floor medicinal save room, though this is only if players tell Rebecca to stay in the save room as opposed to exploring the mansion. Fighting Yawn can be tricky because of its size, though it only takes four shots from the shotgun to force it to flee.Yawn was named as such because of how it was said to resemble a yawn with the way its mouth opens as wide as it does.Yawn Part IIYawn will be faced a second and final time in the second floor room locked behind a Helmet Key lock. Inside is a blue piano, and upon investigating Yawn will slither out of the empty fireplace and attack, creating a hole in the floor in the process.The battle functions much like the first bout, only this time Yawn must be killed and requires a considerable amount more punishment to beat. If the player is poisoned this time they are left to carry on without any assist. Though by this point blue herbs to cure the poison are now accessible and can be found throughout the mansion. Any of the damage inflicted on Yawn previously will have no effect for the second battle.NeptuneA vicious, great-white infected shark. Neptune is the most uneventful 'boss' as fighting it is completely optional and the overall encounter is extremely short-lived. Upon entering the aqua tank, Neptune and two lesser sharks will begin to swim towards the player and attack. Though while the player character's movement is subdued due to the knee high water, players could easily reach the room that'll drain the tank while barely coming into contact with Neptune.Once the tank has been drained Neptune and the other sharks will be left to flail about on the floor and are now completely harmless. Players can choose to mercy kill them--a single attack from any weapon will kill them--however it is not necessary. When encountered in the water the sharks are invincible.For some reason when playing as Jill, there is a cutscene depicting Neptune's point-of-view as it swims towards her. This does not occur when playing as Chris and Neptune is encountered as is without any formal introduction.Plant 42A huge and incredibly hostile plant that has been infused with the T-Virus. Dubbed Plant 42 for being located within ''Point 42'', the carnivorous plant has entrenched itself within the Residential Building and uses its vines to attack its prey throughout the building via small holes in the floors, walls and ceiling. If the player nears any of these holes, the plant's vine will attack and attempt to strangle the player until they waggle it off by mashing on the buttons. Once the body of the Plant has been located, this initiates the boss battle. Large in size, reaching the ceiling at around 12ft in height, it primarily attacks by using its vines to squirt small droplets of acid, though it will also attempt to attack the player by swiping them with its vines as well should they get close enough.The best strategy is for the player to continually stay on the move to avoid the droplets of acid, while also taking some time to shoot the Plant in between. After enough damage, it will recede only to quickly sprout back out. As Jill, once this occurs Barry will arrive conveniently equipped with a flamethrower and will lay waste to the creature killing it. If players choose to first make the V-Jolt poison and administer it to Plant 42's roots before hand, this will then automatically start the fight off in phase 2 during when Barry would ordinarily arrive.As Chris, players may have to fight against Plant 42 on their own until it's killed, as Chris doesn't know how to handle chemicals. However, if the player told Rebecca to stay in the medicinal save room, then as soon as Chris enters the room he will quickly be grabbed by the creature, just as Rebecca arrives on the scene. Chris will then throw her a file to help in creating the V-Jolt. Now controlling Rebecca, the player is to head to the nearby chemistry room and make the concoction. With the V-Jolt made, the player must then find the roots within the building located in the aqua tank and administer the V-Jolt, which will weaken Plant 42 as before, releasing Chris. Though this won't have killed it completely and will still require the player to finish it off as Chris.Black TigerA gigantic tarantula, even by the giant spider standards of the game, the appropriately coined Black Tiger is colored in shades of black and grey. It functions like its smaller kin of spiders, though its poison spit is more ferocious and will actually shoot three splashes at once with a greater range. The environment is relatively small, which allows the player to run around the creature to keep out of its poison distance. The shotgun, Bazooka and magnum work as expected, though Black Tiger is especially weak to flame rounds. As Chris, the player will have a flamethrower available which can be effective, however its short range may prove to be a liability.Once killed, a multitude of small spiders will begin to seep out of its corpse, though leaving the area and returning will remove them from the area.Tyrant T-002 Part IAfter Wesker's betrayal is revealed, he (or Barry, accidentally) will release Tyrant, where it will then proceed to slowly walk towards the player. The battle itself is relatively simple as it will only walk towards the player, though it won't flinch against any gunfire. Keeping Tyrant at a safe distance, while circling the large lab equipment, the player should be able to down the monster without taking any damage so long as they have enough ammo. During this first fight Tyrant only requires four magnum shots to down.For the Sega Saturn version, players must fight against two T-002 tyrants simultaneously.Tyrant T-002 Part IIThe final battle of the game, this second encounter with Tyrant is only triggered should the player have Barry or Rebecca alive, otherwise this battle will be skipped altogether and Brad Vickers will arrive to pick up the remaining characters.Should the player's supporting character be alive to set the self-destruct sequence, Tyrant will erupt from the ground on the heliport and its gameplay design has now been drastically altered. No longer content in steadily walking towards the player, Tyrant will now routinely break into a quick sprint and swipe with its massive claw at the player dealing a fair bit of damage, while also knocking them away a fair distance. After Tyrant has received enough damage, or the timer that is ticking down has reached around 20 seconds, Brad Vickers will drop down a rocket launcher the player must use to kill Tyrant. One shot is all it will take to kill it.[CR]Unlockables[CR]CostumesUpon completing the game with the 'Happy' Ending, which involves all three main characters surviving the story, players are gifted a special key for any following playthroughs with their completed save file. The key can be used to unlock a closet, located behind the locked Armour Key door in the main hall, which houses an additional costume for Chris and Jill.WeaponsIf players complete the game under 3 hours, they will find a rocket launcher with infinite ammo in their inventory for any following playthroughs with their completed save file.For the Director's Cut version, completing the game's advanced mode regardless of the time will gift the player a Colt Python with infinite ammo in their inventory for any following playthroughs[CR]Development[CR]The father of Resident EvilResident Evil came about at the request of Capcom for Shinji Mikami to develop a game set in a haunted house like their earlier Famicom title, Sweet Home. Due to the popularity of shooters at the time, the original version of the game was in first person. Later, Capcom requested the game have a fixed camera style with a third person perspective like the earlier survival horror game, Alone in the Dark.Mikami originally wanted Resident Evil to be a game about fighting ghosts but he decided to make it into a zombie game instead, thinking it would be much more exhilarating than fighting with evil spirits. For the first six months of development, he worked on the game on his own without anyone's assistance. Mikami managed to increase the workforce by fifteen personnel and from that time on, the team gradually increased in number until, towards the end of development, he had more than fifty people working on the game. Among those people were Hideki Kamiya, Hiroki Kato, Jun Takeuchi, Motoi Fujita, Ippei Masuda, Yasuhiro Anpo, Katsutoshi Karatsuma, Kiyohiko Sakata and Ippo Yamada.The development was a shaky process and Capcom showed little faith in Mikami's game. Thinking it would not sell well, Capcom decided to cancel the project but Mikami defended it hard until they decided not to. In the end, Resident Evil sold really well and became a household name throughout the western world, much to Mikami's surprise.During the concept stage of development, Resident Evil was originally intended to be a co-op game, but due to technological constraints it was not possible at the time. Some of the elements that were originally intended for co-op eventually became the zapping system in Resident Evil 2, and to a more advanced extent Resident Evil 0.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack, titled Biohazard Original Soundtrack Remix, was composed by Makoto Tomozawa, Akari Kaida, and Masami Ueda, except The Moonlight Sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven.

The graphics were much sharper and new outfits for Chris and Jill were added as well. Since it was made for Windows 95, playing it on current operating systems may be difficult due to compatibility issues.The original Japanese PC version published by NEC in December 1996 supported their PowerVR graphics accelerator card and 800x600 resolution, but this was downgraded to Direct3D and 640x480 resolution in the 1997 Western releases published by Virgin Interactive due to legal issues with NEC.Sega SaturnThe Sega Saturn version, released in July 1997, featured an unlockable Battle Game minigame, which later became standard in sequels, as well as special costumes for Chris and Jill.Director's CutAn updated version of Resident Evil was released on September 1997. It featured Advance mode where it changed camera angles for each area, shuffled enemy and item positions and added new costumes for Chris and Jill.Dual Shock ver.The Dual Shock version was an exact same game but featured dual shock support as well as new symphonic soundtrack. The Japanese Dual Shock version featured a bonus disc that contained downloadable save data and footage of the Japanese dubbed version of the opening cutscene and other footage, along with gameplay footage of the cancelled Resident Evil 1.5.Game Boy ColorA Game Boy Color version was planned but it was cancelled, cited by Capcom to be of poor quality.GameCubeA remake of Resident Evil was made in 2002, featuring new graphics, gameplay elements, environments and story details. Shinji Mikami stated that the Gamecube version is 70% different from the original. In 2015, a HD remastering of the GameCube remake was released on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC.Nintendo DSTo commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series, Capcom made a Nintendo DS port titled "Resident Evil: Deadly Silence." It featured Classic Mode, the original game with little enhancements, and a Rebirth Mode, containing more enemies and new puzzle elements that utilized the touch screen capabilities. Multiplayer was also included where up to four players can participate the coorperative mode and the competitive mode.PlayStation NetworkResident Evil Director's Cut Dual Shock Ver. was ported to the PlayStation Network in Japan on November 22, 2006 and in the US in 2009. The Director's Cut version was released on EU on March 23, 2011.   [CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Return to Zork</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Infocom's Return to Zork is a first-person point-and-click adventure. Gameplay revolves around exploration of different areas, collecting items, talking to characters, and solving puzzles. Combat is fairly minimal in the game. Often the player will have to combine a variety of odd items from their inventory to make a single item that will allow them to progress further into the game. The game was originally released at a time when CD-ROM gaming on the PC was new. As a result, it uses FMV sequences liberally. The game features numerous references to the original text adventures. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The opening cut scene features the famous White House from the first text adventure, Zork I. The first few lines from the game also appear on-screen, starting with: "You are standing by a white house." After movement commands are typed in, (as part of the cut scene, not by the player), the mailbox outside of the house is opened. Inside is a message delivered through a Tele-orb. The player hears that they are a sweepstakes winner and that the man is "looking forward to..." but he is cut off before he finishes the message. The assumption is that the man is attacked by an unseen enemy. The next part of the cut scene is a fly-through of a range of mountains, eventually leading to the Valley of the Vultures. The player receives another message via a Tele-orb from Wizard Trembyle about needing "a new battery", which is the first puzzle of the game, although the solution does not come until much later. This Tele-orb is carried by the player in their inventory and Trembyle contacts them at several points during the game to deliver hints, often in the guise of cryptic messages.The next area is a lighthouse owned by a deranged keeper, who warns of the "Road to the South." This is where a puzzle involving different objects begins; the player cannot journey down the road but must find a way into the town of Shanbar. After the player leaves the lighthouse, Wizard Trembyle appears again, saying "What a bore! Oh! That reminds me, did you hear the one about the appe...[laughter] about the appetite of the wild boar in the forest of the sp..." but the transmission cuts out. This is a reference to the Forest of the Spirits, a maze-like forest that the player visits in the latter half of the game.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Revolution X is an on-rails light-gun arcade shooter, developed and published by Midway. Its final prototype was released on May 23rd, 1994, followed by the official release the following month on June 16th. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In a dystopian future, the corporations have taken over. The New Order Nation (NON), lead by the villainous Mistress Helga, have waged war on the youth and have banned music, television, and video games. But the greatest injustice is that they have kidnapped Aerosmith! The player must defeat the NON with the power of music. Which means firing CDs at guys in yellow suits and motorcycle helmets, and giant glowing green skulls! [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is a standard rail shooter in which the player is led along a set path and must defeat enemies by aiming and shooting at them with the yellow button. The home versions were not light gun-compatible.Each stage has hidden rooms containing a member of Aerosmith. Rescuing all members of Aerosmith and collecting Aerosmith's winged logo after each rescue will unlock the game's best ending, consisting of a party with the band and a bonus room filled with loot and smoking hot babes. [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The members of the band are hidden within the levels and if they are all found the player gets the proper canon ending.The songs Eat the Rich, Toys in the Attic, Sweet Emotion, and Walk this Way are looped throughout the game. Not the entire song, but rather a few seconds of each, over and over and over again.There were plans to make a Public Enemy version, but that game never came to fruition.The CD-ROM releases of Revolution X featured full-motion video sequences with members of the band informing the game's plot.Following a particularly large explosion, Steven Tyler will occasionally yell "Toasty!", an homage to Dan Forden's uppercut reward in Mortal Kombat II, which had an advertisement for Revolution X in its attract mode.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Road &amp; Track Presents - The Need for Speed</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Road &amp; Track presents: The Need for Speed is an arcade driving game developed by Electronic Arts Canada, and was released in 1994 for 3DO, DOS, Sega Saturn, and the PlayStation. The game was presented by Road &amp; Track, an automotive magazine. A special edition of this game was released in 1996 for Windows 95 support. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Road &amp; Track featured three different game modes: Race, Time Trial, and Tournament. Players who won tournament mode by finishing top of the standings after racing all of the tracks in succession were awarded with a bonus track and car. Subsequent victories gave the player a mirror mode, and finally a rally mode (all the tracks were dirt).Road &amp; Track also featured police chases. On the three point-to-point tracks, which also featured traffic, players could be ticketed and eventually arrested if they were overtaken by a police car.Vehicle handling was markedly different to that of the real Need for Speed games. Despite the outlandish jumps featured in the tracks, the cars had slower steering responsiveness and more accurately reflected each car's unique handling characteristics in the real world. This can be attributed to the game's relationship with Road &amp; Track, who provided the development team with car handling notes, as well as engine and gear change audio.In keeping with the game's attempt at realism, players could run acceleration and braking tests on the Rusty Springs track. The game also had a replay feature, in which players could choose to view the entire race, or just the highlights, which were usually just the crashes. [CR]Cars[CR]Road &amp; Track had nine cars in total, each with a set color. They were:Lamborghini Diablo VT (Black)Ferrari 512TR (Red)Dodge Viper RT/10 (Blue)Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 (Green)Porsche 911 Carrera (Blue)Toyota Supra (Red)Acura NSX (Silver)Mazda RX-7 FD (Yellow)Warrior (Bonus Car) (Purple) [CR]Tracks[CR]There were seven tracks in the game, each with bonus mirror and rally modes. They were: City (point-to-point)Coastal (point-to-point)Alpine (point-to-point)Rusty Springs (closed circuit)Autumn Valley (closed circuit)Vertigo (closed circuit)Lost Vegas (closed circuit) (bonus track) [CR]Showcase[CR]Road &amp; Track's association with the magazine of the same name led to a very detailed car showcase in which players could view pictures, stats and videos of all the cars, with accompanying audio commentary. This feature was an early staple of the Need for Speed franchise, although subsequent iterations were not as detailed.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Road Rash</title_clean>
		<plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. [CR]There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.[CR]There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.[CR]If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.[CR]The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</plot>

		<title_clean>Robo Pit</title_clean>
		<plot>Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.[CR]Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness![CR]The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.</plot>

		<title_clean>Rockman X4</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man X4 (known in Japan as Rockman X4) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation on September 1997 in the US.The fourth game in the Mega Man X series (and the sequel to Mega Man X3), the game is the first to be built for 32-bit consoles (allowing them to use a new higher-quality art style, higher-quality audio, and a game saving system). Mega Man X4 also features animated full-motion video cutscenes and separate campaigns for both Mega Man X and Zero (who now has a different close-ranged combat style with his Z-Sword).Set in 21XX, shortly after the events of Mega Man X3, a new Reploid anti-Maverick military force has risen (the "Repliforce") led by the powerful Reploid, General (and his second-in-command, Colonel). When massive floating city Sky Lagoon crashes down to Earth (killing millions of civilians) and Repliforce is believed to be behind it (soon regarded as a force of Mavericks), X (teamed up with rookie Maverick Hunter Double) and Zero (teamed up with Colonel's kind-hearted sister, Iris) must investigate the Repliforce's plan to build a utopian space station (believing it to be used for a more sinister purpose).The game was later released for the PC in Japan (on December 3, 1998) and North America (sometime in 1999) and is included in the Mega Man X Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube (released on January 10, 2006).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]"Get Ready!"The gameplay for X is similar to the previous games in the series; X has his X-buster that can be charged up to shoot out a powerful projectile, he can climb on walls, and has a dash move. When bosses are defeated, X can inherit their powers in the form of a weapon with limited ammunition. X also has armor upgrades - Helmet, legs, body armor, and X-Buster - that are found in four of the eight levels; they can upgrade X's power for the X-buster, and others can give him special abilities that he never had.Zero is similar to X in terms of basic mechanics (Dash and climb), but differs greatly in terms of combat. Zero is more up close melee style, he also has no projectile attacks (With the exception one that is earned by Storm Owl). Zero has no armor upgrades - it's partly due to the fact the armor upgrades are not compatible to Zero (It was explained in Mega Man X5). When a boss is defeated, Zero learns a new technique instead of a new weapon - he also has no limit to how many times he could use his newly learned techniques.Other upgrades can be found in each of the stages. Such as heart containers, that can increase the health bar; and energy capsules that's use to store extra health. In the previous games, the player can hold up to four energy capsules, but in Mega Man X4, only two are found for the health bar and a third one is use to refill a weapon's ammo.UpgradesThe Fourth Armor.Helmet: The helmet upgrade allows infinite energy for all of X's weapons.Legs: The leg upgrade allows X to hover in the air for a short amount of time.Body Armor: The armor upgrade gives X a new ability known as Nova Strike - it's a powerful air-dash move. The way the Nova Strike is done is by filling up a meter by taking enough damage - it's similar to the G-Crush armor from Mega Man X2.X-Buster: For the first time in the X series, Mega Man X4 allows the player to give a choice of two X-Buster upgrades. One of them lets X charge up his X-Buster up to four times. The other version gives the X-Buster a fourth level when charged up.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]JungleThe most well drawn level in the game, the jungle level has X or Zero going through streaming water while battling javelin wielding mavericks that can shoot spears from their backs in eight different directions. Other areas contains large gaps with a waterfall raining down in between with falling logs that are used as platforms for X or Zero to get through. Mechanical bee hives are also present - they can generate robotic killer bees. Robotic snakes are also found - they can sneak up on X or Zero while crossing through trees.Snow BaseA snowy level that's filled with mechanical polar bears that have the ability throw out sharp ice blocks. Other sections have X or Zero going through spiked floors with sliding platforms that will disintegrate in a short period of time; on the platforms, are mavericks with skiing gear on. The other section of the stage is filled with frozen blocks that have bombs or the little helmet mavericks frozen inside. And the last sections of the stage has a bird that can change the scenery by freezing everything.Marine BaseAll of this level is done via "land chaser" - a hover bike that can shoot out projectiles. It's a fast moving stage that has pipe bombs planted on the ground and other mavericks on land chasers as well; Jet Stingray will appear in the middle of the stage to shoot out some ground hunters to try to stop X or Zero. The land chaser has the ability to dash on the ground or in mid-air.Military TrainNot much platforming in this stage, but there's lots of shooting involved. X or Zero are on top of a train going through waves and waves of mavericks - some of them are equipped with hand guns and can throw grenades. At one point one in the stage, X or Zero will be in control of a mech suit that's equip with a laser sword that can do some heavy damage.Cyber SpaceProbably the most creative stage, Cyber Space contains yellow spheres moving along slowly across the stage; if unable to avoid it, the sphere will suck X or Zero to the center of it and do some damage. Portals will also appear with mavericks coming out of them. While X or Zero is going through the stage, they will be timed, if they make it through a section of the stage quick enough, they will be ranked. If they get the highest ranking (S rank), they will go through a short area that contains a heart container, energy capsule, or an armor upgrade.Bio LaboratoryAt the beginning of the stage, X or Zero will go through a flight of stairs that will actually rotate 360 degrees while moving along (kind of giving the player the sense that it looks like 3D). Other areas have X or Zero going through short tunnels with mavericks with powerful drills on top of the tunnels ready to destroy the place as soon X or Zero crosses through. Another part has X or Zero moving upwards through a small corridor filled with hovering mavericks that shoot out projectiles.Air ForceIn this stage X or Zero will be on top of an aircraft going through laser shooting canons, giant mavericks that shoot out missiles, and even more gigantic canons that can shoot out devastating lasers. Another mech suit will be present for X or Zero to take control, but this one is different than the one that was found in the Slash Beast stage. This mech suit can hover in mid air and can shoot out charged up projectiles.VolcanoA lava filled stage that contains sections that has X or Zero going through falling rocks, giant fireballs coming out of the ground, and platforming sections that has fireballs falling through in between the gaps. But some of the platforms are not safe to be on, some of the fireballs will shoot out from the ground and will go right through one of the platforms that X or Zero is on.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]Name: Frost WalrusDescription: He protects the weapon which lies deep within the snow base.Level: Snow BaseWeapon: Frost Tower (X).

		<title_clean>Sakura Taisen</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Developed in 1996 between Red Company and Sega, Sakura Taisen is the first entry in the now-iconic dating sim/strategy RPG franchise. The game's development was lead by Ouji Hiroi, who had previously directed the immensely popular Tengai Makyou series, and featured character designs by Kousuke Fujishima, famous for his work on several Tales games and the Oh My Goddess! manga.Sakura Taisen was originally released on the Sega Saturn in Japan on September 27, 1996 and was a huge success; selling out the day it hit the market. With the game's amazing sales several spin-off titles were released and the story was adopted into an anime as well as a series of stage plays. A sequel soon followed with the release of Kimi, Shinitamou koto Nakare in 1998 and the original game was later ported to other systems by M2.A remake of Sakura Taisen was eventually developed for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 titled Sakura Taisen: Atsuki Chishio Ni, which featured a new 3D battle system, redone artwork, and a reworked story.[CR]Setting and Story[CR]Sakura Taisen is set in alternative-historical rendition of the Japan's Taishou era (about 1923). Most technology is powered by steam, from automobiles to personal computers.In 1918 an invasion by Kouma demons devastated the Imperial Capital, Teito Tokyo. The monsters were stopped, but at great human cost. As reconstruction was finished in 1925, plans were put into place to defend the capital against further assault. An elite anti-demon unit, the Imperial Assault Troupe, would operate in secret and combat the demons, this time aided by the powerful Koubu "Spirit Armor" suits.Under the command of Lieutenant General Ikki Yoneda, a hero of the Kouma war and one of the surviving members of the original, unarmed anti-demon squad, the Imperial Assault Troupe would operate in secret, based under the Grand Imperial Theater in Tokyo's Ginza district. By day, the unit would be called the Imperial Acting Troupe (a wordplay on the Japanese characters for "Assault" and "Act"), and its pilots would be Japan's greatest actresses.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The story unfolds in episodic fashion, each episode beginning and ending with a "previously..," and "next on..." eyecatch, giving the feeling of playing an anime TV series.The game operates in two modes: Adventure and Battle.In Adventure Mode, the player controls Squad Captain Ichirou Ohgami as he goes about daily activity in the theater, interacting with the characters and building social relationships with them via the LIPS system.LIPSBelieve it or not, this is a successful LIPS choice.LIPS, in essence, is a specialized style of dialog tree, one that inserts minigame-like elements into the typical "choose an option" interaction. At its most basic form, it is a timed dialog response. Players must choose an option before time runs out. However, letting time run out is also considered a "valid" option, one considered as "no response." Different responses appeal to different characters, adding or subtracting invisible "trust points," which eventually determine the ending of the game. BattleDefend Ueno Park!Sakura Taisen's battle mode is conducted via a turn-based, isometric-view, grid-movement system superficially similar to that found in Final Fantasy Tactics. Trust points gained or lost during the Adventure portion of the game also confer stat bonuses during that episode's battle. This system would be replaced by ARMS in the PS2 remake.During their turn, units can move and attack, defend, heal or charge spiritual energy (to use for special attacks). Unit abilities vary with each character, with some preferring ranged, area, or close-combat techniques. Ohgami, as the squad captain, has the special ability to "cover" a selected unit, protecting it from damage when attacked, and subsequently gaining trust points with the pilot.[CR]Main Characters (Spoiler Warning)[CR]Selected personally by General Yoneda, the girls of the Flower Division ( "Hanagumi"), possess vast amounts of Spirit Power and the strength of will to use it against those who would harm the peace of Tokyo. Acting by day as the country's greatest opera actresses, they would defend the citizenry by night. Squad Captain and Ticket Clipper!Ichiro OgamiBirthdate: January 3, 1903Age: 20Height: 176 cm (5'9")Weight: 65 kgBlood Type: AAs an Ensign in the Imperial Navy, Ichirou Ogami was surprised to find his first assignment was to be under an Imperial Army General. He was surprised again, when he found that that assignment was to be "Ticket-taker for the Grand Imperial Theater." He was even more surprised to discover the Imperial Acting Troupe's true nature, and his own status as the Flower Division's captain. Ogami possesses a high level of Spirit Power, a trait extremely rare in men, and required to operate a Koubu. More importantly, General Yoneda felt it was important that a male presence was needed in the Flower Division, the best to mediate between the girls' strong, sometimes conflicting personalities. Ogami would be needed to help them work in harmony, making them as strong in spirit as in battle. His white command-model Koubu uses enhanced communications equipment to coordinate squad members. In combat Ogami wields two swords in the Rou-Kou Mekkyaku ("Wolf-Tiger Destruction") style to eviscerate threats to the capital.The New GirlSakura ShingujiBirthdate: July 28, 1905Age: 17Height: 155 cm (5.1")Weight: 44 kgBlood Type: ASakura is the daughter of Kazuma Shinguji, a hero of the Kouma War who sacrificed himself to save the capital. Coming to the city from her home in Sendai province, she joined the Assault Troupe to carry on her clan's - and her father's - legacy. As the "new girl" in the Flower Division, Sakura was at first regarded by the others (especially Sumire) as a clumsy country bumpkin unsuited to city life. Through hard work, practice, and natural talent, she's proved her worth, both as an actress and a fighter. She dislikes mice, and due to a childhood accident, is deathly afraid of thunder and lightning. Riding her pink katana-wielding Koubu, she wields the Reiken "Arataka" ("Spirit Sword 'Wild Falcon') in the Hokushin Ittou-ryu discipline ("North Star Sword Style"). Her namesake is the Cherry Blossom ("Sakura").Sumire is actually younger then SakuraSumire KanzakiBirthdate: January 8, 1907Age: 16Height: 161 cm (5'3")Weight: 50 kgBlood Type: BHeiress to the massive Kanzaki Heavy Industries conglomerate, Sumire was one of the first test pilots for the prototype Spirit Armor (then called the Oubu). She is the self-proclaimed "Top Star" of the Imperial Acting Troupe. Conceited and imperious, Sumire is the classic diva. Addressing him only as "Ensign," she orders Ogami around like a slave. She is, in truth, affectionate and insightful, and passionate about life, both as an actress and as a soldier. She can't stand spiders. Her violet Koubu gracefully swings a Naginata, exhibiting the elegance of the Kanzaki Fujin-ryu style ("Kanzaki Wind-God Style"). Her floral namesake is the Violet ("Sumire").I don't speak Russian!Maria TachibanaBirthdate: June 19, 1903Age: 19Height: 186 cm (6'1")Weight: 65 kgBlood Type: OBorn to a Japanese diplomat, Maria was orphaned during the Russian Revolution, eventually joining the revolutionary forces. Traumatized by the loss of her squad captain, she shut out her emotions, becoming a merciless sniper and earning the nickname "Kazuar" ("Fire-eating Bird"). She later moved to America, finding work as a Mafia enforcer before being scouted out and recruited by the Troupe's vice-commander, Ayame Fujieda. Prior to Ensign Ogami's arrival, Maria served as the Squad Captain. Though she initially refused to accept him as her commanding officer, she came to trust him as he proved himself in battle. Maria is a peerless sharpshooter, and rarely leaves home without her customized Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver pistol. Her black Koubu unit is equipped with gatling guns and sniper cannons, making it deadly at long range. Maria's height, commanding presence and deep voice often lead to her playing male characters onstage, though she occasionally fantasizes about taking more feminine roles and cooking. Maria is named after the Orange Blossom (" Tachibana").Koi Koi!Kohran LiBirthdate: March 3, 1906Age: 17Height: 156 cm (5'1")Weight: 42 kgBlood Type: BLosing her home and family in the chaos of the Chinese Revolution, Kohran was raised by a family in southern Japan. Her cheerful nature and happy-go-lucky attitude is emphasized by her folksy Kansai accent. Kohran is an avid inventor and believes that machines and technology should be used to spread happiness and help people. She often gives her creations the "Mr." appellation, such as "Mr. Freezy" for an air conditioner. Unfortunately, they have the tendency to backfire or explode, leaving Ogami to clean up the wreckage. In combat, Kohran's green Koubu provides powerful supporting fire from mounted rocket artillery launchers, as well as using all sorts of unusual weapons, such as remote mini-robots and Mahjong-tile guided missiles. Kohran is named for the Crimson Orchid ("Kohran") and Japanese Plum Blossom (Chinese "Ri", Japanese "Sumomo").Waai Waai!Iris ChateaubriandBirthdate: July 5, 1913Age: 9Height: 106 cm (3'6")Weight: 18 kgBlood Type: ABThe youngest member of the Flower Divison, Iris is a powerful psychic. Born into an aristocratic family of Champagne, France, she had great difficulty controlling her powers, and for her own (and others') safety was forced to live in isolation, her only company being a teddy bear named Jean-Paul. She joined the Troupe in Japan at Vice-commander Fujieda's request. She acts onstage alongside the rest of the Flower Division, playing childrens' or young girls' roles. Cute and expressive, she addresses Ogami as "Big Brother". Piloting her yellow-gold Koubu, Iris is capable of teleportation, telepathy and telekinesis, as well as repairing the team's battle damage. Outside of battle, she occasionally works with the Troupe's other divisions to enact powerful psychic rituals. Her floral namesake is the Iris."Snakes, why did it have to be snakes"Kanna KirishimaBirthdate: September 7, 1903Age: 19Height: 197 cm (6'6")Weight: 78 kgBlood Type: BKanna hails from Okinawa, a chain of southern Japanese islands long famous for its inhabitants' idiosyncratic ways. Her macho, tomboyish personality often clashes with Sumire's, leading them to bicker constantly despite their close friendship. Kanna calls Sumire a " Cactus-Woman," while Sumire likens her to a monkey. Like Maria, she often plays male roles, and played as Son Goku in the Troupe's rendition of "Journey to the West." She hates snakes. Kanna is a master of Ryu-Ku karate, a powerful discipline which enables her to take on bears and bulls barehanded. Her highly mobile red Koubu, equipped with specially hardened knuckle weapons, engages foes in close quarters, pummeling them with powerful kicks and punches. Her floral namesakes are drawn from the Canna Lily ("Kanna") and the Paulownia tree ("Kiri").[CR]Supporting Characters (Spoiler Warning)[CR]Liquid Breakfast? Yes please!Lieutenant General Ikki YonedaGeneral Yoneda is a true war hero, once leading the original, unarmored Anti-Demon unit during the 1918 Kouma war. Wielding his sword Shintou "Mekkyaku" ("Divine Sword 'Destruction'") he fought against the Kouma demons alongside Sakura Shinguji's father Kazuma. Yoneda commands the Imperial Assault Troupe, acting as the Grand Imperial Theater's manager during tranquil times. While on the surface he appears at first to be a laid-back drunkard, he views all the girls of the Troupe as his daughters. At the same time, he punishes himself, for no father would choose to send his children out to fight.A bombshell, in and out of uniform.Vice-Commander Ayame FujiedaLike General Yoneda, Ayame Fujieda once fought in the original Anti-Demon unit. Her sword was the Shinken "Shirahadori" ("Holy Sword 'Strike Halter'"). She held feelings for another member of the unit, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, but was left alone after he disappeared following the war. As the Troupe's XO, she coordinates between the various branches of the Troupe, including the Flower Division. In battle she commands the combat airship Shogei-Maru, and is the direct liaison between the Flower Division and the upper echelons of command. Outside of combat, she serves as a producer for the Flower Division's various plays. Though somewhat distant and reserved, she has many male fans.Yuri, Kasumi, Tsubaki (left to right)The Wind DivisionThe members of the Wind Division act as the Flower Division's support staff, piloting the group's various combat transports and relaying orders and information between the squad and the Troupe at large. They deploy the high-speed "Rolling Thunder" ( "Gourai-Go") transport train, as well as the Shogei-Maru itself.There are three members of the Wind Division, who all staff the theater when off-duty:Kasumi Fujii - She leads the Wind Division, and runs the theater's administration office.Yuri Sakakibara - Yuri is the senior usher, and sees to the audience's needs during plays.Tsubaki Nonomura - Tsubaki is the cashier at the theater's gift shop and concession counter.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Sakura Tsuushin is a romantic visual novel adventure which follows the story of Touma Inaba (&#22240;&#24161; &#20908;&#39340;), the protagonist, who is trying to get into Keio University. On the day the exam scores are posted, he meets Mieko Yotsuba (&#22235;&#33865; &#32654;&#21682;&#23376;), a readhead he falls in love to at first sight. After he finds out she got in, but didn't, he decides to lie and say he passed the exam and got into in order to impress her. He lives with Urara Kasuga (&#26149;&#26085; &#40599;) who has an unrequited love for him which is the only reason why she doesn't tell anyone that he is not really a college student and helps him in his love pursuit.The game features anime style video clips as well as dialogues with slightly animated characters on static backdrops which forwards the story, branching it based on players actions and answers during conversation with other characters. Save game options is only available at key points in the story and cannot be done anywhere during gameplay as is case with most of visual novels. Bottom screen is used for text and does not have opacity, with graphical content appearing only in the upper area, whether static images or video clips. Certain key animations are done in full screen.</plot>

Still operating in secret under the Grand Imperial Theater, the group still performs in sold-out operas and revues.[CR]New Characters[CR]Two new principal characters were introduced to the game, new arrivals from a disbanded proto-squad, the Hoshigumi ("Star Division") Ohgami could also interact with these characters and gain trust points with them, in the fashion of the original.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sega Rally Championship was notable at the time for its simulation of different track surfaces. It is fondly remembered by many for its musical jingles and voiceovers.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]Sega Rally Championship was originally released in arcades. The game was later ported to the Sega Saturn and PC. A later version was released for Saturn with NetLink support, for online multiplayer via modem. A port of the game was included with the Playstation 2 game Sega Rally 2006. A Gameboy Advance game was also released with the same name although it is rather different.[CR]Interesting Facts[CR]The developers at Codemasters have previously cited the game as an influence in the development of Colin McRae Rally. The game was ranked 44th in the top 50 console games in the Guinness World Records 2009: Gamer's Edition[CR]</plot>

		<plot>After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega. [CR]Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an "Arcade" and a "PC"/"Saturn" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.[CR]As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.[CR]Another feature was the "Global Ranking" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only "Global Net Events".</plot>

		<plot>Well, it's a soccer game made by Sega but with an arcade-like style of gameplay. So the handling is kept pretty straight-forward: one button for a shot towards the enemy goal (from any position on the field), one for passing to teammates and one for lobbing. But  simple doesn't mean limited since a couple of things are not explained in the manual and you'll have to figure them out yourself, which can take some time.[CR]You can choose between dozens of national teams from all over the world. Player names are made up since there's no Fifa license or anything but they're editable if you feel like correcting that. Game modes include Exhibition, Tournament, League or World Cup. You can play either versus the CPU, vs. up to 2 human players or even coop (2 humans vs. the CPU or other 2 humans).</plot>

		<plot>The protagonist of the game is a Japanese high school student, who was frequently transferred from school to school in various cities of Japan. During the summer holidays, he receives an anonymous letter, containing only one sentence: "I want to meet you". He decides to travel to all the cities where he attended high school, and resume the contact with the girls who could have sent him this letter. But which one did send it, and which one is going to be his true love?..[CR]Sentimental Graffiti is what is usually referred to as dating simulation. Instead of following a story, like in adventure games, the player makes choices that influence his relationships with the game's female characters, thus shaping his own story. [CR]There are twelve cities to travel to, and twelve girls to have a relationship with. Compared to some other dating simulations (such as  Tokimeki Memorial  games), the gameplay system in Sentimental Graffiti is rather simple, focusing on freedom of movement and choice rather than statistics. [CR]The player can choose between various means of transportation (different kinds of train, plane, boat, etc.), and different locations within each city. The backgrounds are digitized photos of real locations in Japan, while the characters are hand-drawn anime style pictures.</plot>

		<title_clean>Shin Megami Tensei - Devil Summoner</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Devil Summoner was the first major spin-off game of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, released by Atlus in December 1995 for the Saturn in Japan. In 1996, a Special Box edition of the game was released. In 2005, ten years after the original release, the game was ported to the PSP; this version was considered for American localization by Atlus USA, but was denied by Sony due to the port not having any significant new content compared to the original.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]StructureThe game is comprised of Wizardry-like dungeon crawling, with travel between dungeons taking place on an over-world (like the one found in Nocturne). Because of the player's role as a detective - in addition to being a Devil Summoner - they will be asked to investigate various paranormal occurrences throughout the city; some of these will advance the story, while other are simply means to gain money and experience. Money - separate from Macca which is used to barter with demons - is important because the player will be using it to buy gear such as armour and weapons throughout the game.Nakama (Demon Friends)A core mechanic of many of the Shin Megami Tensei games, the ability to converse with demons during combat and recruit them to your purpose. There are multiple facets to the recruitment system, simply asking a demon to join your side will not always end in success; every demon species has it's own personality, and it can be an exercise in trial and error to get a positive reaction. What follows are the different mechanics that factor into the conversation system.The Stance is seen in the upper left. The red, green, and blue bars represent the extremity of the alignment (this demon, Hariti, is high in Light and Chaos.)Stance -The first Shin Megami Tensei game to feature this system (found in newer titles such as Strange Journey), stances are an alignment system similar to that found in the Dungeons and Dragons series. There are the primary alignments of Dark, Light, Neutral; within those are Chaos, Law, and again Neutral. Having an opposing stance to the demon you are trying to recruit can have severely negative consequences; unlike in the original Shin Megami Tensei however it does not completely lock you out of being able to recruit them. The Stance extends to any demons you have in your party as well - as in, if you have a demon of the Dark Chaos type in your party, it will make recruiting a Light Law demon very difficult.Full Moon - During a full moon, demons lose themselves in their emotions. Certain demons will simply refuse to speak with you, while others will be impossible to converse with and recruit unless it is a full moon.[CR]Yarai Ginza[CR]Comprised of many useful shops, dealing in abnormal goods and services, this area acts as the primary hub for the game. In addition to the various shops, it is also the location of the Kuzunoha Detective Agency, which contains the sole save spot in the entire game (this was changed in the PSP version, allowing the player to save wherever they want).NameInteriorUseKuzunoha Detective AgencyKyouji's home. The only save save point in the game. There is also a computer from which the player can contact "Red Man", a contact on DDS.net who will give hints on how to progress.Mansion of ProphecyMary appears to be a normal fortune teller, but her uncanny accuracy reveals her true nature as one connected to the demonic realm. Supplies Kyouji, and the player, with Demon Summoner contracts, keeping a large cut of the fee for herself.Maruse Real EstateThe real estate business is just a front for Mr. Maruse's real trade, guns and swords. The player can buy vital weaponry and ammunition here, and will gain access to new stock as the story progresses.Self DefenceFabulous Daffy deals in the most fashionable of attire. His stock ranges from magically imbued robes to good old fashioned kevlar vests.Kon-no-YaAn antique dealer who also happens to sell items helpful in fighting demons. He sells items that can used in combat, such as one use reflective shields, as well as convenience items such as a map revealer and a back-upper; the back-upper is the only means for saving the game outside of the detective agency, but only one can be carried at a time.Haguruma PharmacyA drug store dealing in more than just over the counter meds. The selection includes medicine that cure the player of harmful effects, or simply healing them.Clover GymBehind a locked door in the Clover Gym is an operating room; when you're dealing with fire breathing demons you don't have time to worry about ethics and sanitation. The Player can revive fallen allies and be cured of all ailments here.Body Energy ChapelHome to a mysterious cult which deals in spiritual energies. Macca can be exchanged for cash, and vice versa.Gouma-Dono HotelBeneath the Gouma-Dono Hotel is a massive research chamber, used by the hotel owner Victor for his experiments in demonology. Eager for research data, Victor allows the player to fuse demons free of charge.[CR]Full Plot Summary[CR]*Spoilers Ahead*The player takes on the role of a nameless (named by the player) young man, living in Hirasaki City with his mother and father. He is asked out for coffee one day, by his friend Kumiko, who, upon meeting up with the protagonist, tells him that she has been studying the works of a Professor Azuma, a professor at the local university who specializes in the supposedly mystical past of Japan.Kumiko has decided to visit the library to look for a book written by Prof. Azuma, his most thorough examination of the dark arts practised in Japan's past; upon finding the book however, she discovers she has left her library card at home, but luckily the protagonist has his and allows her to check the book out with it. Satisfied with the find, she then asks the protagonist to tag along with her to the University, where she hopes to speak with Prof. Azuma.But, after arriving at the University she remembers she had reserved some concert tickets for tonight; protagonist to the rescue again, he agrees to pick up the tickets on the other side of town, then meet back up with Kumiko at the coffee shop.Come with me if you want to live.Arriving at the building where the tickets are held, the protagonist finds himself trapped inside upon entering, and suddenly there's a shitload of demons abound; luckily Kuzunoha Kyouji jumps out of nowhere and blows them all away, then tells the protagonist to stick with him if he wants to stay alive. At the top of the building Kyouji has a showdown with Takashi, an amateur demon summoner and vampire, and mops the floor with him. Kyouji is hesitant to leave the protagonist alive, thinking he may squeal, but before he makes up his mind Rei Reiho appears - telling Kyouji to chill out and shooing the protagonist off.Sure, you can try to run. I kinda removed all the exits, though.Ticket-less, but life intact, the protagonist heads back to the coffee shop, where he's told by the owner that Kumiko decided to head to the park; before leaving the shop and heading to the park though, the protagonist happens to catch a glimpse of Kuzunoha Kyouji - or at least a picture of him, accompanied by the news that his corpse was found not far from the building you just came from. On his way to the park, the protagonist gets pulled aside by Sid Davis, a creepy looking dude with a star tattooed on his head. Sid's got some questions for the protagonist, and wants to discuss them in an abandoned building nearby; naturally the protagonist agrees. What Sid wants to discuss is the book Kumiko checked out of the library, and Sid thinks the protagonist has it since it was checked out under his name. He's not too happy to learn the protagonist doesn't have it, and decides to murder him. But being the gentlemen that he is, he gives the protagonist the chance to make it out of the building with a head start - except he forgets to mention that he magically got rid of every exit. So, trapped in some corner of a dusty building, the protagonist gets his ticket punched.Charon - The Ferryman of StyxSo the protagonist ends up in limbo, with a ticket across the river Styx in his hand. Even death isn't is so simple as it turns out, because the boat master Charon says there's a bit of a problem, namely that the protagonist isn't meant to be dead, at least not at this moment; a lucky break, the protagonist gets to return to the world of the living, except Charon can't find his original body, so he decides to send his soul into the body of someone who died near him, at around the same time.That body happens to belong to Kyouji - who scares the shit out of a doctor when he rises up off an operating table. Rei happened to be waiting outside, and she and the new Kyouji get out of the hospital and head to the Kuzunoho Detective Agency to get their bearings. Rei doesn't seem to notice that Kyouji is not who he appears to be, though she senses something is off. Considering the news report that stated Kyouji is dead, Rei thinks it would be a good idea for Kyouji head out and show his face to his friends in the neighbourhood; some are surprised, others aren't, but it's obvious that this isn't the first time Kyouji's stirred up trouble.When Kyouji shows up at Mary the fortune teller's, she insists on giving him a reading - which draws out the spirit of Kyouji, the real one. Kyouji is surprisingly calm given the situation, and basically tells the protagonist not to get his body beaten up too badly, and to stay alive until he can find a way to get back into it. For the time being however, the protagonist is Kyouji, and Mary decides to give you work in the same way she did Kyouji.Fuguruma - A demon inhabiting a box-cart.The first assignment involves investigating a demon incursion at the library you visited earlier; someone is desperate to find that book Kumiko checked out. Opposition is relatively weak, made up some of the familiarly low tier demons such as Poltergeists and Obariyons. The boss of the area is Fuguruma, who states that humans are fooling around with a book that deals with knowledge far beyond their understanding.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Rei ReihoDetective/ Female/ Blood Type: O/ Height: 5' 5"/ Weight: 101lbs/ Birthday: September 20th 1971/ Favourite Food: NikumanReiKyouji's partner in the demon hunting and crime solving business. She's adept with magic and can utilize most any weapon - though she prefers long range rifles and whips. Considering their often on-edge relationship, it's a mystery as to how they came to be working together.Kuzunoha KyoujiDevil Summoner Detective/ Male/ Blood Type: B/ Height: 6' 0''/ 159lbs/ Birthday: August 28th 1968/ Favourite Food: Yarai Confectionist's ManjuKyoujiA Devil Summoner of the Kuzunoha bloodline, Kyouji operates as a private detective in Tokyo; hunting and befriending demons on the side. He spends most of the game trapped in soul form, outside of his own body, and needless to say he is not happy about it.Hatano KumikoStudent/ Female/ Blood Type: B/ Height: 5&#8217; 4&#8221;/ Weight: 108lbs/ Birthday: December 5th 1975/ Favourite Food: RamenKumikoA student at Kitayama University, Kumiko lives in a prestigious district of Tokyo.

Like Kyouji, he uses a COMP to assist in his Devil Summoning &#8211; his is disguised as a bible rather than a gun.Victor (Frankenstein?)Hotel Manager/ Male/ Height: 6&#8217; 4&#8221;/ Weight: 183lbs/ Blood Type: B/ Birthday: December 25 1826/ Favorite Food/ Dutch WineManager of the Gouma-dono Hotel &#8211; though in truth he merely uses it as a front for his research in demonology. He assists the main character by allowing use of his demon fusing apparatus, and is happy to do so since it gives him valuable data. It is unclear whether or not he is related to the legendary Victor Frankenstein.[CR]Vice System[CR]The ability to converse with demons during battle, and possibly recruit them to your party, makes a return in Devil Summoner, but with some changes. Namely the Vice System, which measures the loyalty of any demons you recruit. The Loyalty grades go from 1 - 10, and at 1 it is likely that the demon will not listen to a word you say, choosing to "Boycott" during your turn (which means they just Guard), or casting spells you didn't tell them to.For different types of demons there are different ways to raise their loyalty - these cant separated into three categories: Level Difference, Item Hungry, Partnership.Ashinaga - Enjoys large level differences, and splitting skulls with her heels.Level Difference - Common amongst the Dark type Demons, demons with this nature will change their loyalty depending on the level of Kyouji. Unlike in the later SMT games, in Devil Summoner your demons do not level with you, so the greater the level difference between Kyouji and a demon with the Level Difference affinity, the greater their loyalty would be. The equation for determining loyalty through level difference is: (Kyouji's Level - Demon's Level) / 4 + 1. So with a difference of 36 levels your Demon's loyalty would be at 10. For combat purposes this nature is not very helpful, because, obviously, having a very low level demons in your party is not helpful regardless of their loyalty.JackFrost - Will gladly watch you die if you don't pay him his dues.Item Hungry - Common amongst the Neutral type Demons, demons with this nature are eager for valuable items, and loyal to anyone who gives them out. The type of item heavily affects how much loyalty will be gained, with the paltry Maseki giving not even enough for 1 level (Using only Maseki it would take 100 of them to get the demon to loyalty 10) whereas the beautiful Diamond will rocket the Demons loyalty up (taking only three to reach loyalty 10). Not every item in the game can be given to a Demon, they are only interested in items from their realm (Maseki, Chakra Drops) and not in any store bought human junk. The most effective items however are Gems, which can be gained by speaking with Demons during battle.Odin - He'll respect you, so long as you respect him.Partnership - Common amongst the Light type Demons, demons with this nature strengthen their bond with Kyouji by travelling and fighting with him. Their loyalty is raised during by combat, if Kyouji is successful in getting them to perform the moves he wants them to (Ask them to cast Dia, and they cast Dia, that's a success). The range of required successful orders ranges from 10 - 30, in order to raise their loyalty 1 level.[CR]Proto-Demon[CR]The Proto-Demon is a bio-engineered approximation of a supernatural demon, programmed to be loyal to its creator. The creature is able to absorb the power of true demons through fusion, becoming increasingly powerful the more demons it consumes. Unlike ordinary demons it does not have any &#8220;Vices&#8221;, and thus has a loyalty level of 10 from the moment the player obtains it.Proto-Demons can be obtained by defeating a Gargantua &#8211; a type of Proto-Demon controlled by the scientist Dr. Thrill; the player will fight Dr. Thrill multiple times throughout the game, but all the encounters are optional and can be skipped entirely (though if you do that you never get a Proto-Demon). Only one Proto-Demon may be controlled at a time, so encountering Dr. Thrill while you have a Proto-Demon in your party will mean you do not end up with another Proto-Demon. In addition to that, the Proto-Demon you acquire depends on which incarnation of Gargantua you destroy &#8211; if you destroy the first available incarnation, you end up with the first and weakest form of the Proto-Demon, and if you destroy the final Gargantua you will be given the most powerful Proto-Demon.Heroic DemonsHeroic Demons are the demonic embodiments (or possibly literal reincarnations) of great historical warriors:%2ors%h as the lady-knight Jeanne d'Arc or the legendary Japanese general Yoshitsune of Minamoto. They are created by fusing a Proto-Demon of a certain strength with a specific Demon.[CR]PSP Version[CR]The PSP port had some slight modifications and additions made in order to make the game more user-friendly, and to adhere to new censorship rules. Hint giving NPCs were added to certain areas to help with the more obtuse puzzles: for example in the demon infested police station, an NPC was added explaining that entering a teleporter from opposite directions will alter the exit location.The sprites for the Angel and Waxwork were altered to give them less revealing clothing; the sprite for Rahu was given a more severe change.Rahu -Saturn SpritePSP SpriteQuick List of Minor ChangesThe auto-map functions on the 5th level of all underground water-way dungeons.Improved translations of demon names.Addition of [Normal] and [Hard] difficulty settings. The original featured neither.Balance changes to combat (most notably the accuracy of all magic is far improved).In the Saturn version the player was able to have get every Hero (see list below) by turning their Proto-Demon into a Hero before encountering a Gargantua. This is not possible in the PSP verison, as the player will not receive a new Proto-Demon if they have a Hero in their party.[CR]Demon Compendium[CR]Races are ordered by demons' levels, from highest to lowest.DeityVishnuAmun-RaOdinHachimanPrometheusIntiMegamiAnatLakshmiPallas AthenaBrigidErzulieScathachNakisawameHeraldMetatronSraoshaSandalphonAzraelLailahVictorAvianGarudaYatagarasuVidofnirPhoenixHamsaTreeHaomaKukunochiDaphneOshiraEnigmaKamaYariloNeko ShogunKanbariGenmaHeimdallHanumanKresnikCu ChulainnMauiJambavanIctinikeKhonsuAvatarBarongUkano MitamaChimeraAnubisKamapua'aHolySleipnirPabilsagAiravataYatsufusaApisXiezhiShiisaaPrimeSalamanderUndineSylphGnomeMitamaSaki MitamaKusi MitamaAra MitamaNigi MitamaHeroRamaGuan YuFereydunYoshitsuneJeanne d'ArcFuryShivaSusanooKartikeyaWu KongTriglavOgunLadyKaliCybeleBlack MariaSednaHaritiSekhmetKikuri-HimeKishinMariciBishamontenThorTake-MikazuchiZhong KuiTyrNagasunehikoOtogo-doujiDragonZhu YinAnantaIlluyankaPatrimpasQuetzalcoatlDivineCherubThroneDominionVirtuePowerPrincipalityArchangelAngelFlightRukhDa PengHolawakaCaladriusToufeiYamachichiBaYomaGaneshaPeriXiuhtecuhtliTenguMarutShaytanAgathionFairyOberonTitaniaSprigganLoreleiDomovoiPyro JackJack FrostKijimunaaPixieSnakeOuroborosOrochiYurlungurCuelebreNagaVouivreYato no kamiBeastCerberusAmmutGdonHsing-HsingNekomataKatakirauwaHairy JackKabusoUMAHare of InabaAerophanteMamedanukiOliverJiraeGogmagogTitanOumitsunuKwanchaDwarfRibhuKoropokkurKnockerNightHypnosSuccubusIncubusHinoenmaSandmanKikimoraNacht KoboldFallenAbraxasBotisBarbatosPursonBifronsNisrocMelchomStolasBruteYaksaBerserkerPurskiYomotsu-IkusaDokkaebiYamawaroBogleFemmeRangdaDakiniAmazonYuki JyorouTodomekiLeanan SidheYomotsu-ShikomeVilePalesTao TieKanaloaChemoshPachacamacRaptorHuoniaoAnzuZhenStymphalidesItsumadeMoh ShuvuuBifangWoodEsZaccoumAlrauneMandrakeJubokkoReaperMotGuedheChernobogThanatosIxtabWilderTaowuCatoblepasPorewitNueSuikoAfancWairaJakiGrendelGirimehkalaGashadokuroNahui-OcelotlAshinagaTenagaOgreDeadPatriotZombie CopAgonyRastamanWaxworkScarecrowVerminMothmanMyrmecolionOkikumushiYowieUbuTyrantChi YouNergalRahuLokiBalorDrakeVasukiMushussuPythonBasiliskOwabamiAspToubyouHauntVetalaKudlak&#12484;&#12457;&#12525;&#12512;EnkuGhoulObariyonPretaSpiritMacabreLegionInfernoTorsoQuicksilverPoltergeistFoulDoppelgangerTattoomanKiller ChopperHooliganSlime[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Shining Force III</title_clean>
		<plot>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.[CR]The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. [CR]The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.[CR]It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.</plot>

		<title_clean>Shining Force III - Scenario 1 - Outo no Kyoshin</title_clean>
		<plot>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.[CR]The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. [CR]The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield.

		<title_clean>Shining the Holy Ark</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shining the Holy Ark is an RPG within the 'Shining' series of games. Developed by Sonic Software Planning, Shining the Holy Ark is a traditional turn based RPG with a third person perspective, very similar to Shining in the Darkness that was released on the MegaDrive/Genesis. The similarity between the two games is unmistakable, as the battle system, art and even music are similar. The game also shares similar elements to other Shining games, such as a similar menu design, and the class level upgrade system once a character reaches level twenty.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Melody in Battle.Shining the Holy Ark is a traditional turn based RPG where attacks are taken in turns, and special attacks and magic spells can be used. The first person perspective of the game is constant, and is used to explore towns, although the world map does not involve any exploration when moving between areas. The first person elements are sometimes used to solve some puzzles, such as charging a wall, and other traditional RPG puzzle elements are involved, such as finding items to further your progress or to defeat a boss.One unique element to Shining the Holy Ark is the pixie system. Players can find a different variety of little pixies within the game by exploring towns and dungeons, which can then be called upon at the very start of a battle to unleash extra damage. Depending on which direction the enemy attacks from, the player selects the pixie that will be used for a preemptive strike. Finding all of the pixies within the game adds an extra level of depth.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The evil Vandals, a supernatural race of demons, wish to revive the thousand year kingdom by using the power of the Ark. Three legendary warriors are chosen to fulfill a prophecy as the mercenaries, Arthur, Melody and Forte are hired to capture the rogue ninja, Rodi, within the Enrich mines. As the prophecy begins to unfold, an unknown ship crashes into the mines and Arthur, Melody and Rodi are possessed by the spirits of the ship as their friend Forte is possessed by an evil spirit. Arthur and Melody team up with Rodi to help save their friend, a task that takes them on a journey across Enrich to fulfill the prophecy and stop the revival of the thousand year kingdom!The World MapThe story of Shining the Holy Ark is continued ten years later in Shining Force 3, where the Vandals also make an appearance.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are seven playable characters in Shining the Holy Ark, including one hidden playable character, each with their own abilities. Although only four characters can be used at a time, all characters except for the main character, Arthur, can be switched in and out of the party line up whilst in battle. The playable characters are:ArthurThe main character, who's name can be changed. He is a mercenary and expert swordsmen that can use offensive and supportive magic. He is one of the characters possessed by the spirit.MelodyAnother mercenary, but a powerful shaman. Her healing skills make her the team healer, but she also has a powerful 'summoning' type spell called Elemental. She is also one of the characters possessed by the spirit.RodiA rogue ninja that loses his memory, he is one of the fastest characters of the team and has a great variety of offensive and illusion based magic. He is also one of the characters possessed by the spirit.ForteA powerful wizard, and a mercenary that partners with Melody. Early on in the game, he is possessed by an evil spirit, but when playable, has some of the strongest offensive magic in the game, including an upgraded version of the Lightning spell.LisaA female paladin and mercenary, she is a skilled warrior with supportive magic, similar to Arthur, but much slower in combat.BassoA dragon-knight and mercenary partnered to Lisa, he is one of the slowest warriors in the team, but also the strongest. He does not use magic.AkaneA female ninja and sister to Rodi, she is an expert healer with great support magic, and also one of the fastest characters in the team.DoyleA halfling ninja who appears to help Rodi several times throughout the game, he is a hidden playable character. Like Basso, he is strong, but does not use magic.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SimCity 2000 is the second game in the SimCity franchise, first released in 1993 for Mac and DOS. A Windows playable version, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995. SimCity 2000 was also ported to many consoles, ranging from the SNES to the GBA, and is also available on PSN.What a city!SimCity 2000 adds many features that were missing from the original. With new tools in transportation, zoning, and infrastructure, as well as a isometric view and a smoother UI, SimCity 2000 gives players more freedom than the original SimCity to create cities. With no real goal, the game instead directs players by consequence, being given a set of tools and set loose on a dynamic play area. Given enough money, the player can use the tools in any way they want, but if their cities are not generating income, the money will soon run dry. Players will find that to function, cities need utilities, civic services, transport infrastructure, and a fragile balance between homes and jobs. Playing within (and sometimes outside) the limits of the rules and seeing what works is part of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In SimCity 2000, the player starts off with a randomly generated piece of land, which could be terraformed to their liking. The player then builds a city, providing it with necessary utilities and civic structures. They also need to balance their budget, their income coming from rent and taxes, and their expenditure from building and maintaining the city. If they run below a certain budget deficit, they will be kicked out of the mayor's office, losing the game.Undeveloped ZonesThere are 3 main types of buildings in SimCity 2000: Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI). They are not built by the player directly. Instead, the player "zones" certain plots of land for specific development. Zones are the main type development in any city in the SimCity franchise, and what grows in those zones are determined by the amounts of utilities and services that plot can receive, and the land value of the area. Players can also zone landfills, air and seaports, and military bases. These zones are not as affected by land value as RCI zones but they will drastically affect their surrounding areas negatively.Land value is an important factor in SimCity 2000, and can be raised or lowered by the presence or absence of water features, trees, and pollution. It can also be affected presence or absence of civic structures, power and water supply, and good transport infrastructure. Rewards, special buildings given to the player for reaching certain population milestones, also help to boost land value of the area.ArcologiesArcologies are special futuristic buildings, rewarded to players once they reach a city population of 120,000 and they are after the year that they are invented. There are 4 arcologies in SimCity 2000: Plymouth Arco, Forest Arco, Darco, and the Launch Arco. Arcologies provide the city with a huge boost in population, the smallest one (Forest Arco) providing 30,000 residents, and the mighty Launch Arco giving a massive 60,000 residents.Launch Arcos also have a special effect. After building 300 Launch Arcos, a special message "The exodus has begun." will appear, and the they will "launch" (in reality, just explode). The player will then be compensated for the construction costs after all the Launch Arcos have been launched. This only occurs in the PC and Mac versions of the game.DisastersDisasters will hamper a player's construction of their cities (unless they turned it off). These disasters are random, and range from mundane (a fire), to the extreme (monster invasions). Players can also activate these disasters purposely to destroy their cities for fun. There are 8 disasters in the game:Fire: An inferno blazes through the city. Fire stations help put it out.Flood: Waters flood into the city. Dispatch emergency services to limit floods.Air Crash: A plane crashes into the city and starts fires.Tornado: A rampaging tornado rips up trees and buildings.Earthquake: An earthquake destroys both buildings and underground infrastructure.Monster: A giant sphere with an huge eye descends on the city, and sets things on fire with its laser beams.Hurricane: A hurricane destroys buildings and cause flooding.Rioters: Unhappy Sims protest on the streets and start fires. Police presence helps to limit rioting.ScenariosSimCity 2000 comes with 6 scenarios, where the player can take over an existing city (either fictional or based on a real city) and try to solve its problems. They are: Charleston, Dullsville, Flint, Hollywood, Oakland Hills, and Davenport. An additional scenario pack was also released for the game, Scenarios Vol 1: Great Disasters. As the name suggests, players have to battle disasters in 12 new cities: Atlanta, Barcelona, Chicago, Davenport, Homestead, Malibu, Manhattan, Oakland, Portland, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Washington D.C.[CR]Expansions[CR]SimCity's expansions and different editions mixed and matched their content. While added content like the SCURK were initially offered only in expansions eventually they were included in separate retail packages. Scenarios Vol. 1: Great Disasters added on unique scenarios to the original game. These included scenarios based on some real life events like major hurricanes or nuclear meltdowns. These disasters usually decimated the player city and would require and almost complete rebuild. The SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK) is a toolset that players can use to create and modify buildings for SimCity 2000. It first shipped with the Scenarios Vol 1: Great Disasters expansion but then made its way to the SimCity 2000 Special Edition released in 1995.[CR]System Requirements[CR]PC System Requirements (GOG Version)OS: Windows XP/Windows VistaProcessor: 1.8 GHz Processor or equivalentMemory: 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)Video: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)HDD: 2GB of free hard drive space[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Simulation RPG Tsukuru is, much akin to its brethren in the RPG Maker line of games, a construction kit and editor to make RPGs. In this case, it's "simulation" RPGs or, as they're more commonly known, tactical/strategy RPGs in the vein of Fire Emblem and Shining Force.The construction kit gives the player a menu based interface where it's possible to change almost every detail of the game being made, down to the character sprites, background music and individual statistics for each character.</plot>

		<plot>Another 3rd person perspective arcade flight sim by Sega, similar to their classic  After Burner in gameplay but featuring new gameplay mechanics and an entirely polygonal engine.[CR]As in most games of it's type your objective is to clear a number of stages by shooting anything that moves, but at the end of each stage you can select where to go next thanks to branching paths a-la  Darius, which coupled with 4 different planes to select give the game an increased gameplay value. No multiple lives are given, but you get a life bar (which can be replenished in-flight) to help you outlast your enemies.</plot>

		<title_clean>Sonic 3D - Flickies' Island</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Version differences[CR]The Genesis and Saturn versions of Sonic 3D Blast are identical aside from a few key differences:Saturn version receives enhanced visuals.Each of the two versions have a completely different soundtrack.The special stages are different in the Saturn version, in both level design and visual style (the Saturn version's special stages have polygonal graphics).Graphics ComparisonSpring Stadium on GenesisSpring Stadium on SaturnDiamond Dust Zone on GenesisDiamond Dust Zone on SaturnVolcano Valley on GenesisVolcano Valley on SaturnA Special Stage in the Genesis VersionA Special Stage in the Saturn Version[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A FlickyFlicky Island is a isle that is inhabited by birds called Flickies. These strange birds have magical properties, and one of those powers include traveling to different dimensions through large gold rings. Also on this island are the seven Chaos Emeralds that have incredible powers. Dr. Robotnik discovers this island and he realizes that these 7 gems are here. Then, he finds the Flickies and turns them into robot minions to help him search for the Emeralds.Sonic, who is a friend of the Flikies, shows up at the island. He finds what his nemesis Robotnik has done to them, and now it's up to Sonic to destroy all of Robotink's badniks to free all of the Flickies. Sonic and the Flickies then help each other out to prevent Dr. Robotnik's plans. That is where the birds ability to transport to altered dimensions comes in. This useful power is the way to get to Robotnik and ultimately stop him from getting the Chaos Emeralds and gaining the power to rule the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Playing as Sonic, the player must destroy Robotnik's robots or badniks in order to release the trapped Flickies. Then the player has to collect those Flickies in order to advance to the next zone by going through a large gold ring. The player has to collect five Flickies to advance. The game has seven zones each with three acts. Act 1 and 2 are regular levels which the player explores around the level, destroys enemies, and collects Flickies. The third act is a boss battle.Sonic in "3D"Their is four types of enemies each level and each of those enemies releases a different colored Flicky. Blue Flickies try to find Sonic and when they can't find him they fly around in circle. Pink Flickies are the same as blue ones, but fly around in a larger circle. Red Flickies fly from point A to point B and they don't try to find Sonic, they also jump at times, and they are difficult to catch. Green Filckies make no attempt to find Sonic and move around randomly. Once Sonic reaches and touches him they follow him around. If Sonic is attacked by an badnik he loses a Flicky and he must get him back.Controlling Sonic and other gameplay features are much like other Sonic games. For the Genesis, the D-pad moves sonic around the area, the A button and C button make Sonic jump, and the B button makes Sonic roll into a ball and do a spin dash. And, like many other Sonic games, collecting rings prevents Sonic from dying when he is attacked by enemies.[CR]Zones[CR]The game's levels consist of seven full zones, each comprising two regular acts and one boss act, and one final boss zone that is only accessible to the player if Sonic has collected all Chaos Emeralds. Interestingly, Sonic 3D Blast follows Sonic CD's convention of using alliterations for zone names.Green Grove ZoneGreen Grove ZoneThis tropical zone is typical of the first zone in a Sonic game. Waterfalls, bridges and loop-de-loops adorn Sonic's journey as he speeds across the checkered floor in search of flickies. In the boss fight, Robotnik tries to drop a spiked ball on Sonic from his hovercraft and can be hit when he descends to collect it.Rusty Ruin ZoneRusty Ruin ZoneAn ancient ruins zone in the vein of Marble Zone from the original Sonic and Marble Garden Zone from Sonic 3. Certain tiles put Sonic into a special twirling state that allows him to smash through certain otherwise unbreakable obstacles. The boss fight requires Sonic to jump onto the claws of a large statue in order to reach Robotnik who resides in its head.Spring Stadium ZoneSpring Stadium ZoneSpring Stadium Zone plays yet another Sonic clich&#233; rather straight, fulfilling the role of the mandatory pinball level. Sonic ricochets off bumpers, pops balloons and shoots off flippers as he makes his way to the end of the zone, where Robotnik chases him with a hovercraft equipped with spiked claws.Diamond Dust ZoneDiamond Dust ZoneAn ice level reminiscent of Ice Cap Zone in Sonic 3. Strategically placed turrets threaten to turn Sonic into solid ice, while strong currents of melting snow carries the struggling hedgehog into spiky traps. The boss features Robotnik attempting to freeze Sonic with ice shooters, occasionally lowering his craft to drop a snowman bomb.Volcano Valley ZoneVolcano Valley ZoneIn sharp contrast to the preceding level, Volcano Valley Zone has Sonic navigating a lava level reminiscent of Lava Reef Zone in Sonic &amp; Knuckles. Destructible rocks reveal hidden passages in this volcanic maze where Sonic must jump over broad pools of magma and avoid many a fire-spewing trap. The fire shield (red) is particularly useful in this zone. In the boss arena, Sonic must outrun a tongue of flame as he aims hits at a very stationary Robotnik.Gene Gadget ZoneGene Gadget ZoneA largely mechanical level filled with industrial fans and dangerous electric traps. The lightning shield (blue) is particularly useful to avoid getting Sonic electrocuted. The boss involves our hero dodging mines on a large treadmill as Robotnik fires missiles at him from his hovercraft.Panic Puppet ZonePanic Puppet ZoneAnother industrial themed level, Panic Puppet Zone is special in that Sonic frees flickies from special containers rather than from Badniks. The boss for this zone, and the final boss if Sonic does not have all the Chaos Emeralds, requires Sonic to advance through several tiers of battle mechanics.Final Fight ZoneThe last boss of Sonic 3D Blast is a deadly machine, naturally crafted in the likeness of its master, which chases Sonic through a series of puzzles that loops until the hedgehog is able to land enough hits on the contraption. [CR]Wii Virtual Console version[CR]The Genesis/Megadrive version Sonic 3D Blast was eventually made available for purchase and download through Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service. However, the game was criticized in reviews, one reason being that the game can't be played using the control stick, even if you use a Classic Controller to play it. Using the control stick doesn't do anything; only the directional pad would work. (It is unknown whether the fault lies with the Virtual Console platform itself rather than the people who ported Sonic 3D Blast to it.)[CR]Music &amp; Audio[CR]The music in the game was composed by Jun Senoue, Masaru Setsumaru, Seirou Okamoto, and Tatsuyuki Maeda. They all crated the Genesis version's music, while the Saturn/PC version was composed by Richard Jacques. The Mega Drive/Genesis version's soundtrack was somewhat latter used in other Jun Senoue projects; the music in Sonic Adventure had some elements of the soundtrack. The game over and continue themes were reused from Sonic 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles.[CR]Debug Tap[CR]Soon after the release of the Genesis Sonic 3D Blast, a technique was discovered to get to a debug mode, the technique was to tap the side of the Sega Genesis with some slight power with your finger, has in flicking it, soon after the screen would make a screech and then turn blue, after 2 seconds a menu would pop up allowing the player to select any level in the game with has many lives has the player wanted - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp1uTXPNlzE[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic Jam is a compilation of the first four main entries in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It contains Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and Sonic &amp; Knuckles all on one disc, plus bonus material. Included is a special "Sonic World", which was the first time players got to see and control Sonic the Hedgehog in full 3D. In Sonic World, players can navigate Sonic to various locations around the 3D map to view concept art, character profiles, access a soundtest (containing all the music for every game contained in the collection), or visit a movie theater to watch various Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog game commercials and promotional animations. Additionally, Sonic World contains a number of special "bonus mission" time trials that require you to complete certain tasks in the environment as quickly as possible.[CR]Game.com Port[CR]Tiger's ill-fated Game.Com handheld received a port of the game shortly after the console launched. It featured watered-down versions of Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and Sonic &amp; Knuckles, none of which were actually ported by Sega. The game also does not feature the "Sonic World" section.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Sonic R</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic R is a 3D racing game for the Sega Saturn that was developed by Sonic Team and Traveller's Tales, and is the third Sonic racing game to be created in the franchise, the first two being Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2 for the Sega Game Gear. Other racing games based on the Sonic franchise include Sonic Rivals, Sonic Rivals 2, Sonic Riders, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders and more recently Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing.Sonic R was also released on the PC and within the game compilation Sonic Gems Collection for the Gamecube and PS2 (Japan only).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Unlike Sonic Drift, the main characters of Sonic R, with the exception of Amy Rose and Dr. Robotnik, do not drive a car, but instead run through the stages. The stages themselves are more epansive than traditional racing courses and offer many different routes through each level, leading to hidden short cuts and areas which can be explored. These hidden areas also contain collectable items, such as finding special emblems and Chaos Emeralds which unlock extra characters and stages.As in most Sonic games, rings are an important element of Sonic R. As well as offering protection, rings are used to open up gates that lead to hidden areas and Chaos Emeralds, and are also used on speed boosts to increase the player's speed. Power ups are also a key feature of Sonic R, such as the lightning shield and water shield from Sonic the Hedgehog 3.There are multiple game modes within Sonic R. Most notably is the Grand Prix, where all four stages can be played in order. There is also a Time Attack mode and a host of multiplayer options including a standard versus race, a tag style race where player's must chase after each other and capture them, and a balloon game, where the player must find and pop five balloons before their opponent.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are four playable characters available at the start of Sonic R, with five more that can be unlocked. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, such as increased speed or the ability to run or glide over water. The playable characters are:Sonic the HedgehogSonic is the fastest of the characters available at the beginning, with quick acceleration at the expense of handling. He has the ability to perform a double jump.Miles "Tails" ProwerTails has fairly good speed and acceleration and also retains his trademark ability of flight, enabling him to reach areas other characters may not.Knuckles the EchidnaKnuckles is an all round character with decent speed and acceleration. He also retains his trademark ability of gliding, allowing him to create his own short cuts.Amy RoseAmy is one of the characters that uses a car to race, which can float over water. Her car is quite slow but has the ability to boost.Dr RobotnikDr Robotnik is the other character that uses a car to race, which is slow with poor acceleration but can float over water. He has the ability of shooting missiles. He is one of the unlockable characters.Metal SonicThe Metal Sonic is a robotic version of Sonic that can jump higher than other characters. He is one of the unlockable characters.Tails DollThe Tails Doll is a robotic version of Tails that can float over water without slowing down. He is one of the unlockable characters.EggRoboThe EggRobo is a robotic version of Dr Robotnik with similar abilities and speed. He is one of the unlockable characters.Mecha KnucklesThe Mecha Knuckles is a robotic version of Knuckles which is slightly faster than Knuckles. He is one of the unlockable characters.Super SonicSuper Sonic is arguably the best character of the game and also the hardest to obtain, as he requires all of the Chaos Emeralds. Super Sonic is the fastest of all the characters and can run across water. He is one of the unlockable characters.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are four initial stages within Sonic R to choose from, whilst the final stage is unlocked when all four stages are completed in first place. Those stages are:Resort IslandA traditional tropical stage based around the beach and mountains with a waterfall at the beginning of the stage.Radical CityA city at night based around old Sonic leves such as Casino Night. Within the middle of the stage is a pinball-style area.Regal RuinA ruined Egyptian themed stage at sunset, which contains imagery similar to Angel Island from Sonic the Hedgehog 3.Reactive FactoryA futuristic factory, similar to the fortresses of Dr Robotnik's lairs of previous Sonic games.Radiant EmeraldA beautiful stage set in space with a transparent ground, this is the longest of the stages and must be unlocked.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The music in Sonic R was composed by Richard Jacques and features pop-heavy songs performed by the British singer, TJ Davis. Those songs include:Can You Feel the Sunshine?- For Resort Island.Living in the City- For Radical CityBack in Time- For Regal RuinWork it Out -For Reactive FactoryDiamond in the Sky- For Radiant EmeraldSuper Sonic Racing- The Sonic R main theme and course track for Radiant Emerald if playing as Super SonicNumer One- The Sonic R Ending Theme and CreditsPlus two extra bonus tracks:Super Sonic Racing - X-Tra Club MixWork it Out - Red Raw MixEach stage also has an instrumental version which can be switched on and off within the game options menu.[CR]The Tails Doll Legacy[CR]Buy the Gamecube version to induce 60 pains per second.Tails Doll, one of the unlockable characters in Sonic R, evolved into an internet meme shortly after the release of Sonic Gem Collection, as the collection was the first to introduce many players to Sonic R. If players select Tails Doll in Sonic R the track "Can You Feel The Sunshine" plays regardless of the track selected. At all times Tails Doll floats lifelessly, eyes wide with a face void of any expression. These factors contribute to Tails Doll becoming an internet icon of evil and the perpetual myth that Tails Doll has the ability to curse players.[CR]Easter Egg[CR]Putting the game disk into a standard CD player would play the in game soundtrack. This is possible because the in game music was stored as standard CD audio tracks on the game disk.[CR]Game Credits[CR]Executive Producer - Shoichiro IrimajiriProduct Manager - Youji IshiiProducer - Yuji NakaGame Design Directer - Takashi IizukaHead Artist - James CunliffeLead Artist - Dave BurtonGraphic Advisor - Naoto OhshimaLead Programmer - Jon BurtonCharacter Designer - Yuji UekawaMusic &amp; Sound Producer - Richard JacquesMusic Vocals - T.J.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released in Japanese arcades in January of 1997, Soukyugurentai, alternatively Soukyuu Gurentai and known as "Terra Diver" in the west, is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up.After its arcade release the game was published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Saturn on February 7th, 1997. The PlayStation release came by way of publisher Data East on December 25, 2007.The game was originally built on the STV Arcade Board and the Saturn version is considered effectively "arcade perfect", while the PlayStation version introduced some input lag and other, slight drawbacks. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Humanity has dessicated the Earth, and moved on to zpace colonization in their search of ressources, namely fossil fuels. For years mining facilities are operated on the Moon and Mars and Earth's trading companies work together to revive the planet's economy. One company rises above all others over time - the Jin-Sei or Exhausting Star Corporation - and soon finds itself the defacto leader and ressource controller in many sectors.As years pass, the age of Earth's rehabilitation is replaced by increased competition on the part of the trading companies and suddenly violence and battle are introduced into the equations. In fighting for different sectors and resources becomes common. The Eight Luck Interstellar Development Inc., the second largest company behind Jin-Sei, begins creating alliances with other smaller companies the world-over - their plan? To take over Mars and monopolize the outsourcing of those goods and take control of terraforming initiatives. Using the popular thread of eco-terrorism to hide facts from the public, a war begins between Eight Luck and the Jin-Sei.So, needing a response to this concentrated aggressive effort, the Jin-Sei combines with JSDF to form JDF, and within it a specialized response team of highly trained combat pilots - the Scarlet Lotus Team, or SOQ for short.The player will choose from of four SOQ pilots in the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are four ships to choose from in the PlayStation version of the game (three otherwise). While the general shoot 'em up (shmup) action of the game is identical with all ships and could be described as traditional across the board, each ship also has its own firing pattern and two unique abilities which are part of the more novel mechanics in the game; by holding down a button the player activates a targeting web. Enemies in that web can be locked on to and eliminated effectively without aiming.[CR]Ships[CR]SOQ 004 - Toryu (Dragon Slayer)Pilot: Kaoru YashidaColor: RedSOQ 010 - Shiden (Purple Lightning)Pilot: Ryota MikazukiColor: BlueSOQ 025 - Houga (Phoenix Fang)Pilot: Rika KunimuraColor: GreenSOQ 026 - Oubu (Yellow Warrior)Pilot: Tetsuo ShimoniidaColor: Yellow[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In 1991, the U.S.S.R. (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) boasting the largest military force in history, suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions. Enemy vehicles, tactics, and responses change, based upon your activities, making this the first of STRIKE's new "Living Battlefields".</plot>

		<title_clean>Space Jam</title_clean>
		<plot>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.[CR]The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.[CR]Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.[CR]The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.[CR]The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pep Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.[CR]There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.[CR]The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.[CR]There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</plot>

		<title_clean>Spot Goes to Hollywood</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spot Goes to Hollywood is a 2D isometric platformer developed by Eurocom and published by Virgin for the Sega Genesis in November 1995. The sequel to Cool Spot and the third game to feature Spot, the anthropomorphic red dot and then-mascot of the 7 Up brand of soft drinks. In similar vein to Sonic 3D Blast, Spot Goes to Hollywood takes the sidescrolling action of its predecessor and translate that to a sprite-based platformer in an isometric viewpoint.As one of the many Spots, players must run around various stages based on film genres, such as a pirate ship (pirate adventure genre), a haunted mansion (horror genre), an ancient ruins (adventure genre), and a space station (science-fiction genre).The game was later ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Burst, both released on November 30, 1996. Along with new graphics, new sounds, and new levels (based on the levels in the original version), the port features cutscenes that further develop the story (showing Spot being trapped inside a movie projector).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.In each level, the player must activate the "exit star" at the end of the level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map; the levels sometimes involve doors and winding walkways. In order to do so, the player is required to collect 60% of the plain "red spots" on each level. "Spots" are placed across the level in large quantities. A player's health is monitored by a Cool Spot face. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles.The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Stakes Winner - GI Kanzen Seiha e no Michi</title_clean>
		<plot>Stakes Winner is a horse racing game. Races can be entered by one or two players and involve eight horses struggling for victory; each of the eight horses (in the order which the game presents them in: White Heat, Hot Sand, Euro Union, Asian Hope, Brave Lady &#8212;the sole female one&#8212;, Be Silent, US Fighter, Sky Dancer) given for selection is characterized by three parameters (named &#171;abilities&#187; in-game): speed, stamina, strength, all measured in stars from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. Rival horses are not available for selection to the player: their names are, for instance, the ominous- or hilarious-sounding &#171;Mr Devious&#187;, &#171;Red Vision&#187;, &#171;Sunk Star&#187;, &#171;HelpMe&#187;, &#171;OhMygod&#187;, &#171;Nutseater&#187;. The names are also differentiated by being written all in capital letters the latter ones, normally the former.Before the beginning of the race, while horses approach the starting point, the name of the circuit, course plan, prize money and circuit time record are displayed. During the race, the indicators on the screen are: the course plan (with a moving coloured circular indicator representing the position of each contender), the chronometric indication of time, the horse's energy bar with a line composed of three segments beside it: a red one (that means the horse is in its full strength), a yellow and a blue one (denoting lack of strength); a representation of the horse's face, which portrays its, more or less fatigued or strong status and how intensely it is running.The game controls require the use of two buttons and the control stick or directional pad: one button controls the reins, for slight acceleration, which consumes a little of the horse's energies. The other one controls the whip, for sharp acceleration: this consumes the horse's force significantly. Should the energy be consumed entirely, racing will have to be given up for a while. Two rapid touches on the joystick or directional pad in the direction of travel allow to force away a horse blocking the player's road to victory; two rapid touches in the direction opposite to that of travel vigorously reduce speed. Power-up items represented by icons placed on the course may be taken during the race, raising one of the parameters of the horse by one for some time, giving a temporary boost in speed, or partially restoring the horse. Weather conditions change from time to time: the drizzle may be an obstacle, worsening the status of the terrain. A real second corresponds to two seconds in game (therefore, for instance, a one-minute race will last half a minute).After every stage, the track length, as well as the prize money awarded to the first three finishers are augmented. The series of levels are separated by training stages. If done successfully, training on the dirt or on the turf respectively increases the horse's stamina and speed, whereas training on or &#171;against&#187;,the hill strengthens it. Success in training session is to be attained by pushing a button as rapidly as possible, while avoiding assorted obstacles and hindrances. The player can choose what type of training to opt for.Race courses proceed in the ensuing sequence: MaidensSapporo JuvenileJuvenile Stakestraining2000 GuineasDerby Stakes (the $1.300.000 prize money is mistakenly displayed as &#171;$ 130.000&#187;)St. Leger (BC Classic in the original arcade game)trainingJapan GrandprixEmperor Spring CupChampion StakesSt. Leger  (difficulty is now higher than the previous time)trainingJapan CupJapan Grandprix (difficulty is this time higher than previously)The Arc The TriompheThe game is identical to the original one in all of its fundamental aspects, save for a number of modifications to minor details: continues are still named &#171;credits&#187; (four of them are given: it is possible to select a different horse when continuing the game using a credit after game over) and their quantity is indicated, likewise in arcade games, at the bottom of the screen (although the flashing &#171;Insert coin&#187; on the opening screen followed by &#171;Push P1 start !&#187; has been replaced with &#171;Push P1 or P2 start !&#187;).While the original game was entirely in Japanese (except for race names, given an English translation), the console version, despite not having been released outside of Japan, can be said to be in English (conversely, now race course names have a Japanese translation next to the English name); money prizes are now in dollars rather than in yen, and remarkably changed in value: whereas YPN 5300 were the reward in the arcade version, $540000 are awarded to the winner of a race. Initially, nothing but crossing the finish line in the first place allowed progression in the game; in the console conversion finishing in the first three places guarantees advancement to the next race.Horse energy is named &#171;power&#187; in the Neo Geo version, adhering to the original game, while in the Wii version it was renamed to &#171;life&#187;; furthermore, in the Neo Geo version the blue and red segments are shown inverted beside the energy bar. The console version presents fours levels of difficult: easy, normal, hard, MVS.</plot>

		<plot>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.[CR]A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.[CR]One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.[CR]The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</plot>

		<title_clean>Street Fighter - The Movie</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The arcade version of Street Fighter: The Movie added a bunch of new moves and concepts that hadn't been seen in any previous (or future) Street Fighter games. The arcade version of the game came under heavy criticism from the Street Fighter fan base for trying to imitate the Mortal Kombat games of the time with the live action characters, palette swapped cyborgs and emphasis on juggling. The home versions weren't direct ports of this game, instead the home versions were more directly based on Capcom 's Street Fighter II games with a few simple changes. The home versions were heavily criticized for being pointless, since the original games already existed and were far superior.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Street Fighter: The Movie features much the same roster of Super Street Fighter II: Turbo except for Fei Long, T. Hawk and Dhalsim . This is the only game in the series where the three boss characters keep their western names in the east, though the Japanese names were in parentheses on instruction cards to stop confusion with Japanese gamers. There was some differences in the roster between the arcade and home console versions of the game, with the palette swapped cyborgs created for the arcade version removed and two more well known Street Fighter characters added in the home console version.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter Alpha 2 (known in some countries as Street Fighter Zero 2) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on March 6, 1996.The second installment of the spin-off Street Fighter Alpha series and the sequel to (and remake of) Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, Street Fighter Alpha 2 features five new playable characters (Dhalsim and Zangief from Street Fighter II, Gen from Street Fighter, Rolento from Final Fight, and newcomer schoolgirl Sakura), new backgrounds for all returning characters, and updated gameplay mechanics (including the introduction of the "Custom Combo" system, which allows players to use their Super Meter to make lengthy timed chain combos).Sometime in August of 1996, Capcom released an update to the game (in Japan only), titled Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, that includes hidden character variations of some characters (resembling their Super Street Fighter II Turbo appearances), an updated Custom Combo system (requiring a different combination and less super meter to perform), new moves for some characters, and hidden game modes (including Survival Mode). This version was further revised in the Street Fighter Collection compilation (for the Saturn on November 30, 1997 and PlayStation on December 16, 1997) as Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold (Street Fighter Zero 2' in Japan and Street Fighter Alpha 2' in Europe), adding Cammy (in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance) as a hidden playable character.The original game was ported to the Saturn and PlayStation on September 30, 1996, featuring an arranged soundtrack and the game's hidden boss (Shin Akuma) as a hidden playable character. It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on November 1996 (as one of the two games to use the S-DD1 microchip enhancement for sprite data, causing some loading times) and the PC on November 1998. The game was later re-released (alongside a revised Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold) for the PlayStation 2 in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation on June 13, 2006. The PlayStation version was later digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on June 4, 2009, while the SNES version was digitally re-released for the Wii Virtual Console (on December 7, 2009) and Wii U Virtual Console (on May 22, 2014).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Street Fighter Alpha 2 retains most of the features in  Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams like the three level super combo gauge, alpha counters and air-blocking. The main new feature in Street Fighter Alpha 2 is the custom combo system which replaces chain combos from the previous game. When the custom combo guage is at level 1 or above the player can activate a custom combo by by pressing two punch buttons following a kick. Custom combos grant the player a limited amount of time to chain almost any attacks together into a combo. The time limit is dependent on how much power was in the super meter when the combo was initiated. [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game's roster includes 18 playable fighters, five of which are new additions. Only one of these new additions (Sakura) is a brand new character. Three of the returning fighters were originally hidden in the original Street Fighter Alpha, no longer requiring a cheat code to use.In most versions of the game (the only exception being the original "Zero 2" Japanese version), fighters returning from the Street Fighter II series (except for Akuma) have hidden variations resembling their movesets from Super Street Fighter II Turbo. These versions of Dhalsim and Zangief were included in all versions starting with "Alpha 2", while these versions of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Sagat, and M. Bison were only included in "Zero 2 Alpha" and "Alpha 2 Gold". Ryu, Chun-Li, and Akuma also have hidden variations of some sort.New CharactersSakuraGen (from Street Fighter)Rolento (from Final Fight)Dhalsim (from Street Fighter II, has a hidden SSF2T variation)Zangief (from Street Fighter II, has a hidden SSF2T variation)Cammy (from Super Street Fighter II, based on her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance, added in "Alpha 2 Gold" and only playable with cheat code)Returning Characters Ryu (along with a hidden SSF2T variation, he has a hidden "Evil" variation in "Alpha 2", "Zero 2 Alpha", and "Alpha 2 Gold", in which he has some of Akuma's moveset) Ken (has a hidden SSF2T variation)CharlieRoseDan Birdie Adon Sagat (has a hidden SSF2T variation)GuySodomChun-Li (along with a hidden SSF2T variation, she has a hidden "classic outfit" variation in all versions, in which she wears her Street Fighter II outfit) M.

		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic premise of SPF2T has the player stacking down gems two at a time Tetris style and is always played with two players either Human or Computer. The goal is to explode the different colored gems with the matching Exploding gems by fitting them next to each other. If any of the same colored gems are adjacent to that gem vertically or horizontally, they will explode in a chain reaction. If at anytime four of the same colored gem is matched in a 2X2 fashion, they will conglomerate into one giant gem. The bigger then gem the more points one can score when the matching color of exploding gem is attached. This is a very High Risk, High Reward puzzle game, in that the bigger sets of gems, the less work space you get. The reward is when exploded, the gems will move onto the opponents playing field. When gems hit the opponents side, the gems start off as gem counters with a number on them and a color. Every time the opponent drops a set of blocks on his side the counter will drop by one. This See-Saw style battle goes back and forth until one of the players has no more room to drop gems.Occasionally the game will drop down a Multicolored Diamond gem. Any color that the bottom point of this diamond touches will explode without having the need to be adjacent to it. As a result, the Diamond gem is best used when in a tight situation or a lead up to a chain combo as when exploded gems disappear, they fall prey to the laws of physics. Any Counter gems that get sent to the playing field via the Diamond gem only start the counter at half the amount rather than the full amount, thus reiterating the High Risk, High Reward strategy.The Playstation/Sega Saturn/Game Boy Advance versions of the game included "Street Puzzle" mode, where players would take on specific match fights pitting the selected character against a certain enemy of varying difficulty in order to unlock secret characters, alternate costumes, intermission cutscenes, music BGMs ( Including the vocal song "I Want You to Know" by Sakura Kasugano), etc. The HD Remix version of the game has some of these unlocks available from the beginning, yet this mode and a large portion of the goodies are entirely discluded.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are 8 main characters you can play as. 4 are taken from the Street Fighter series ( Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Sakura) and 4 are from the Darkstalkers series ( Morrigan, Donovan, Felicia and Hsien-ko) Character selection is more important then just aesthetics in this puzzle game as it determines the pattern of the gems you drop on your opponents side. Your fighter was represented by a super deformed tiny version of your character who stood next to your puzzle board and would do their signature special attacks when you did a fair amount of damage. They were just for show and had no effect on the game.There were also 3 secret characters: Akuma, Devilot and Dan[CR]</plot>

The game also has a level editor/maker using a  tUME like editor.Puzzle ModeThe biggest addition to Tetris Plus, the goal is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks  and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and  crushes him.  The ceiling is spiked and slowly lowers every 18 seconds giving you less room to work with. The roof also destroys blocks.

		<title_clean>Tetris S</title_clean>
		<plot>Tetris S is the second of two Tetris games released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. Unlike the arcade port Tetris Plus which was released a few months earlier, it was specifically made for the console. This version includes a single player mode as well as multiplayer against an AI or between two human players. The single player mode works like traditional Tetris and uses the same rotation rules as Sega's earlier arcade game conversions. Like always the player guides blocks down a well with the aim of creating lines at the bottom. These lines are then removed and the player earns points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the well, but in this version there is a continue option allowing the player to keep playing at the current level. The multiplayer works the same way but with one difference: if more than one line is removed the opponent's next few blocks will fall at a greater pace. The number of lines removed affects how many blocks will be sped up. A multiplayer game is played over a set number of matches and the aim is simply to stay alive longer than the opponent. </plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Theme Park is a simulation management game in which the player attempts to build a famous and financially successful theme park. In order to do so, they have to purchase new rides, restaurants and other amenities as well as hiring park staff and keeping abreast of concerns like litter, bored people waiting in lines and squeezing the maximum amount of profit from their parks.Theme Park made its debut on the PC (via MS-DOS) and Amiga home computers. It would eventually be ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Atari Jaguar and CD-based systems like the Amiga CD32, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and 3DO. The MS-DOS CD version featured Full Motion Videos of some of the rides.The game was also remade for the Nintendo DS in 2009 by EA Japan and on iOS around the same time. The PlayStation version was later rereleased on the PlayStation Network. Theme Park was followed by two sequels: Sim Theme Park/Theme Park World and Theme Park Inc/SimCoaster.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World map screen showing different plots of land available for purchase.Like most management games, Theme Park starts the player off with a plot of land that they have to develop. The player can build many things found commonly at an amusement park, such as roller coasters and Ferris wheels, all of which can attract more customers. Players are able to set prices, hire new staff and generally maintain the plot. The aim of the game is to make the theme park as valuable as possible so that it can be sold and a new plot can be bought somewhere else in the world. The player then starts to make a new theme park and the process is repeated.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lara collecting a treasureTomb Raider, originally released in 1996, is an action-adventure game starring Lara Croft: a beautiful and fiercely independent archaeologist. True to the game's name, the game involved Lara exploring tombs and ruins in search of ancient artifacts. The game was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. It was released first for the Sega Saturn but became available soon after for the PlayStation, PC, and Mac. The game proved extremely successful and spawned the now legendary Tomb Raider franchise. The game was re-released with two extra chapters in 1998 as Tomb Raider Gold, and was later remade by Crystal Dynamics with updated graphics and gameplay in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens with a short cutscene in Los Alamos, New Mexico. A nuclear test in the desert causes an earthquake which reveals an ancient artifact. The game then jumps forward to present day, where Lara is given a cryptic mission by Ms. Jacqueline Natla through a laptop delivered to her by Natla's assistant Larson. Lara's interest is piqued when she is informed that there is an ancient artifact -- the Scion -- in the unexplored tomb of Qualopec in Peru. Lara takes the job, and the game begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bridge crossingThe gameplay takes place in ruins across four locations: Peru, Greece, Egypt, and Atlantis. The player must navigate Lara through these ruins in search of three Scion artifacts. The game is presented from a third-person perspective with the camera following directly behind Lara. She has an array of moves and abilities which she can use to navigate tricky platforming obstacles, combat indigenous wild life, and solve puzzles. Some of these basic skills include running, jumping, dive rolls, scaling ledges, swimming, and firing weapons.Lara has two stances which she can flip between; holding weapons and not holding weapons. In her weapon stance she can fight her enemies but must put them away to pull switches and climb ledges. Her default weapons are the dual pistols, which have infinite ammo, but she can also use dual magnums, dual Uzis, and a shotgun.If injured, Lara can pick up small and large medipacks to heal herself, and the game provides a save system that allows players to return to a previous points in the game if they die. The Saturn and PlayStation versions use blue orbs that are scattered sparsely throughout a level for save points. The PC and Mac versions, however, allow for players to save at any time, which relieves the frustration of retracing large portions of the game after dying.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Tomb Raider was widely lauded by the public and press. The cutting edge graphics, atmospheric, intuitive gameplay, and almost unheard of use of a female protagonist caught the public's attention. The game was a huge financial success that turned Eidos Interactive's financial woes around over-night. Lara Croft herself became an icon even outside of video games, appearing on magazine covers and eventually branching into Hollywood. Two Tomb Raider films were made featuring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The masked ninjas return.Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway on November 1995 for arcades.It is a direct update to Mortal Kombat 3, adding new characters (all of which are the return of masked ninjas), arenas, special moves, and game modes (including an 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), while tweaking gameplay mechanics and character balancing. It is regarded as the most competitive game in the Mortal Kombat franchise (prior to its 2011 reboot). A special version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for consoles (known as Mortal Kombat Trilogy).In order to free up space on the game's memory, the screens detailing the game's story, as well as all of the biographies and picture endings for the original characters, have been removed. Regardless, the game's story is no different from Mortal Kombat 3 (involving Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is built off of Mortal Kombat 3 and retains most of its gameplay mechanics. There are four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and dedicated Block and Run buttons. Players have a "Run Meter", which limits their ability to run forward, and "chain combos", in which players can perform pre-programmed combos (by linking normal attacks together) that ends with an attack that sends the opponent flying. The combos are known for not necessarily requiring the user to be 100% accurate on the timing of the button presses, allowing the player to basically press all the buttons in the combo quickly and the combo would essentially play itself out. Each character has new special moves, chain combos, and gameplay balances.BRUTALITY!Fatalities, Friendships, Babalities, Mercy, and Animalities return from Mortal Kombat 3. However, the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis versions sacrificed Mercy and Animalities for a new type of finishing move: Brutalities. Brutalities are long, complex combo strings that, when performed successfully, end with the victim exploding into a shower of blood and body parts. Brutalities require the player to enter the first ten button presses in the combo, and the game takes over from there, depicting the character beating the other character faster and faster until they explode.The game also marks the return of the Endurance Match (originally in Mortal Kombat), in which the player must defeat two opponents consecutively instead of one to win a round. The "Choose Your Destiny" screen reflects this, adding one Endurance Matches to each "tower". Additionally, there is a "Master II" difficulty, adding another Endurance Match to the "tower" while making the game more difficult.More "Kombat Kodes", six-digit codes that are entered cooperatively on the versus screen, have been added, including the ability to change the stage to whatever both players feel like playing. There are now three "Ultimate Kombat Kodes", ten-digit codes that are entered during the Game Over screen, with three new characters to unlock. The Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection removed Kombat Kodes from the online component in the game.Game ModesUltimate Mortal Kombat 3 also includes three gameplay modes, each requiring a different amount of credits to start:Mortal Kombat - Traditional game mode with one-on-one fights.4 Player 2-on-2 Kombat - A multiplayer tag-team fight in similar vein to Endurance Matches.8 Player Tournament - A single-elimination tournament for eight players.Shao Kahn's Lost TreasuresNew to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is the concept of Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures, in which completing the game gives the player a choice between a group of bonuses ranging from battling secret characters to watching a demonstration of each Fatality in the game. These groups are restricted by the difficulty the game was completed on. 8-Player Tournament mode also gives the player access to Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures at the end.Novice Difficulty and higherShows the character's endingPlay a clone of Galaga (only previously accessible through a Kombat Kode or reaching 100 battles)Battle with ErmacBattle with Noob SaibotWarrior Difficulty and higherRandom TreasureFatality Demonstration #1Fatality Demonstration #2Fatality Demonstration #3Endurance Match against Noob Saibot and ErmacMaster Difficulty and higherEndurance Match against masked Sub-Zero and Noob SaibotEndurance Match against Noob Saibot, Ermac, human Smoke, masked Sub-Zero, and MileenaMaster II DifficultySupreme Demonstration (shows most Fatalities, Babalities, Friendships, and Animalities)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The 22 playable characters (including the three unlockable characters)The game includes 19 playable starting characters, two unplayable bosses, four playable secret characters, and one unplayable secret opponent. All of the playable characters (including the previously-hidden Smoke) from Mortal Kombat 3, along with Kitana, Reptile, Jade, and Scorpion from Mortal Kombat II, are the default starting characters in the game. Through new "Ultimate Kombat Kodes", Mileena, a masked Sub-Zero, and a new ninja character (Ermac) are unlockable as playable characters. A pre-indoctrinated version of Smoke, known as Human Smoke, is playable by holding a special button combination when choosing the robotic Smoke.Noob Saibot is still a hidden, unplayable opponent. However, because of the inclusion of masked male ninjas, he is no longer a palette swap of Kano (except in the Sega Saturn version). Featured in the game's opening gameplay montage is Rain, a dark purple palette swap of the male ninjas that serves as nothing more as a fake hidden character for stirring up rumors. Noob Saibot and Rain, as well as the three unlockable characters, are starting characters in the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance versions.CharacterDescription (Additional Notes)ActorKitanaKitana is a warrior princess from the realm of Edenia.

The Bank and Hidden Portal from Mortal Kombat 3 are removed. Noob Saibot's Dorfen and The Church, despite not being in the arena rotation, are now playable via new Kombat Kodes, which allow the players to fight in any stage they choose. This brings the total number of stages to 16. The level rotation works a bit differently, as the first five stages loop once before moving on to the Mortal Kombat 3 stages. The Balcony is always the stage played when facing Motaro. The Pit 3 is always the stage featured when fighting against Shao Kahn. Noob Saibot's Dorfen is always the stage featured when facing Noob Saibot.

It never appeared on the Sony PlayStation due to Sega buying exclusive rights to release it on 32-bit CD-based consoles (as a response to Sony buying exclusive rights to release Mortal Kombat 3 on 32-bit CD-based consoles a year before). To get around this, a rare, special add-on peripheral for the PlayStation was made that upgraded copies of Mortal Kombat 3 to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. The game was later infamously ported to the Game Boy Advance on December 12, 2001 under the name "Mortal Kombat Advance". It is considered one of the worst fighting games of all time. An arcade-perfect port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released on November 11, 2007 for the Nintendo DS under the name "Ultimate Mortal Kombat", which also included online multiplayer via Wi-Fi and a port of Puzzle Kombat from Mortal Kombat: Deception. Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was also bundled in special "Premium Edition" copies of the PlayStation 2 version of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. The game was also loosely ported to the iPhone and iPad by EA Mobile on December 16, 2010. (Restricting the character count to 6 starter characters and 2 hidden characters, while remaking all assets in 3D)An online-enabled version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft Points ($10) on October 20, 2006, days before its intended Wednesday release. This version included 12 achievements worth 200 Gamerscore, ranging from performing certain finishing moves (online or offline) to completing the single-player campaign. The Achievements are notorious for having strange point values, such as 12. This version also includes online leaderboards, adjustable screen sizes (with support for widescreen and standard televisions), and an online mode similar to the "Quarter Match" mode on the Xbox Live Arcade version of Super Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. This version was granted "Arcade Hits" status due to high sales, reducing its price by half. However, in February 2010, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace due to Midway losing the game's publishing rights. The standalone version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 never returned to Xbox 360 under new publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Instead, a new release titled Mortal Kombat: Arcade Kollection was released on August 31, 2011 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and later on February 1, 2012 for Games for Windows Live. This new release featured another online-enabled version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as well as online-enabled versions of Mortal Kombat II and the original Mortal Kombat.iOS VersioniOS IconA version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was released for iOS in December, 2010 by EA. Rather than using digitized sprites of filmed actors, all the characters are rendered in 3D. Although the moves and buttons from the original game are included, a simpler set of buttons and moves were created to make play easier using the touch screen. The new layout has a "special" button, which is usually mapped to a character's signature special move. As an example, instead of back-back-low punch for Scorpion's spear, the player just has to hit the "special" button. Also instead of high and low punch and high and low kick, there are just punch and kick buttons. Fatalities are also included, along with babalities, friendships, brutalities, and animalities. While the arenas are the same as in previous versions of the game, they are also newly designed for the iOS version. Uppercutting opponents into other stages is still possible, as well as stage specific fatalities.Playable characters include:Sub-ZeroScorpionKitanaNightwolfJaxSheevaSonya BladeLiu KangStrykerErmac - an unlockable characterJade - an unlockable characterFour modes are available:Arcade: Standard one player arcade mode.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (known in Japan as Vampire Hunter: Darkstalkers' Revenge) is a 2D horror-themed fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on April 6, 1995.The second installment of the Darkstalkers franchise (and the sequel to Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors), Night Warriors refines the gameplay (including playable boss characters, updated chain combos, new ground-based techniques, an "Auto-Blocking" character mode, and a revamped Special Meter system) while adding two new characters (the dhampir Donovan Baine and the jiangshi Hsien-Ko).The game's plot is a remake of the original, involving an invasion of Earth by the alien Pyron (which happen to take place during a tournament of "Darkstalkers" to see who is worthy to take over the Demon World). At the same time, the two new characters enter the fray as "Dark Hunters" (whose goal is to hunt down the other Darkstalkers, each for different reasons).The game was ported to the Saturn on February 22, 1996, featuring an "Appendix Mode" that allows players to switch between this game's version and the original game's version for certain background stages, character palette, and background music. The original version was also re-released in two compilations: the Japan-exclusive Vampire: Darkstalkers Collection (released for the PlayStation 2 on May 19, 2005) and the online-enabled Darkstalkers Resurrection (released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on March 12, 2013).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Screen Shot Showing the New Energy Bar.While keeping the basic fighting mechanics from the first game including Chain Combos, Crouch walking and air blocking, several refinements and, balance tweaks were made.The energy meter system from the previous game was replaced with a more traditional "stock" system similar to that of Street Fighter Alpha. This system allows you to save up energy to use at a later time.Also introduced in this game were recovery rolls and pursuit attacks. Pursuit attacks allowed a player to attack a downed opponent. While the recovery roll could be used to counter this new mechanic and "roll" out of the way of the attack ether towards or away from the opponent.Chain Combos where heavily modified, and now where called "Hunter Combos". This is a specific kind of chain combo where the player starts by hitting weak attacks and progress up to stronger ones of the same type. This same combo mechanic was later used in the newer Marvel vs franchise.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game features 14 playable characters, two of which are brand new and two of which are boss characters that were not playable in the original.Much like Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting and Super Street Fighter II Turbo, all of the characters' default color palette are changed to an alternate.Returning Playable CharactersCharacterMonsterCountryAnakarisMummyEgyptBishamonSamurai GhostJapanDemitri MaximoffVampireRomainaFeliciaCatwomanUnited StatesJon TalbainWarewolfEnglandLord RaptorZombieAustraliaMorrigan AenslandSuccubusScotlandRikuoMermanBrazilSasquatchSasquatchCanadaVictor Von GerdenheimFrankenstien MonsterGermanyNew Playable CharactersCharacterMonsterPyroAlienPlanet HelstormHuitzilAlien RobotMexicoDonovanDemon HunterUnknownHsien-KoChinese ZombieChina[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Victory Goal is the club-only older brother of Sega International Victory Goal. That makes it not only the first game of the series, but also the first game of the series to include clubs, in this case those of the Japanese J.League. It is also the first one to include real player names, since it is an officially licensed product. [CR]Regarding other aspects, such as gameplay, graphic engine, cameras, etc, everything is exactly like in Sega International Victory Goal, which was in fact supposed to be an worldwide-friendly version of its older brother. As such it was released once the SEGA Saturn had been introduced in all Western markets, unlike this title, which was in fact one of the first titles for the Japanese catalog.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Virtua Cop (known as Virtua Squad for the North American PC version) is a light-gun shooter created by Sega, and headed by Yu Suzuki. Its original incarnation was an Arcade Game in 1994 and it was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995, and then the PC in 1997. It was later bundled with Virtua Cop 2 in Japan and Europe on the Playstation 2 as Virtua Cop: Elite Edition (Virtua Cop Rebirth in Japan) on August 25, 2002 and November 29, 2002 respectively. It included gallery extras and implementation of Namco's Guncon-2 light-gun support, and it is considered the best port of the game. In 2004, a port was developed for the Nokia N-Gage handheld System. This was cancelled by the quality control team before its release.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players assume the role of one of two police officers, namely Michael Hardy and James Cools and use the light-gun to shoot enemies and if a civilian was shot it the player would be penalized. The Name derived from the polygon graphical style which was used in Virtua Fighter as well. This Graphical style was unique because most games of this time period used two-dimensional graphics such as Lethal Enforcers. This was one of the first games to have environmental damage and it may have been the first 3-D shooter to have an exploding barrel.Players assume the role of police officers in a first-person perspective and use a light-gun to shoot criminals and advance through the game, with penalties for shooting civilians. The players could also shoot power-ups that grants him a weapon or a life. The weapon is lost if the player is hit, but not if he shoots a civilian. Virtua Cop was notable for its use of polygonal graphics, which were subsequently used in both House of the Dead and Time Crisis, instead of the two dimensional sprites that were popular for previous games in the same genre. It is also notable for being one of the first games to allow the player to shoot through glass. Its name derived from this graphical style, which was also used in Virtua Fighter, Virtua Striker, and Virtua Racing.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Virtua Cop was a major influence on both light-gun shooters as well as first-person shooters. When it was released in 1994, the game broke new ground by introducing the use of 3D polygons to the light-gun shooter genre, sparking a Renaissance for rail shooters in particular. It was also the first shooter to use filtered, texture-mapped 3D polygons, powered by the Sega Model 2 arcade system. Some of the popular rail shooters heavily influenced by Virtua Cop include the Time Crisis series, The House of the Dead series, Resident Evil series, and Dead Space: Extraction.Virtua Cop was also the primary inspiration for the seminal first-person shooter GoldenEye 007, which was originally envisioned as an on-rails light-gun shooter akin to Virtua Cop before it ended up as an off-rails first-person shooter. According to creator Martin Hollis: "We ended up with innovative gameplay, in part because we had Virtua Cop features in a FPS: A gun that only holds 7 bullets and a reload button, lots of position dependent hit animations, innocents you shouldn&#8217;t kill, and an aiming mode. When you press R in GoldenEye, the game basically switches to a Virtua Cop mode. Perhaps more importantly following the lead from Virtua Cop, the game was filled with action. There was lots to do, with very few pauses."  [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Justice shot.Sometimes they just get too close.Virtua Cop 2 is a rail shooter dealing with the topic of modern police operating in a giant metropolis called Virtua City. The game can be controlled by the use of various peripherals like the light gun or PC mouse. The player does not manually control camera movement, but has to skilfully shoot the scripted enemies and avoid killing civilians. The player gets rewarded with extra points for disarming opponents by performing 'justice shots' or drowning them with a hail of bullets by performing '3 point shots'. Virtua Cop's sequel provides gamers with two modes - 'arcade' and proving ground. The first one allows players to choose from one of three available stages of various difficulty level in any order. The second one serves as a shooting ground with 3 fields to choose from. After each segment of the game the players can see their statistics which involve: score, the number of killed gangsters and civilians, total number of shots, the number of successful shots and overall accuracy. Apart from killing villains the game features numerous destructible surrounding elements (you can even play drums!), which lower the overall accuracy, but are cool enough, that it is often hard to resist not to shoot 'just one more window'. There are also in-game upgrades that are hidden in these destructible elements. By shooting them the players can gain access to extra lives, magnums, rifles, automatics, shotguns, machine guns and more.[CR]Selectable stages[CR]Stage select.The game features only three selectable stages, but each of them has alternate routes to follow. Each major stage ends with a boss battle.File 1: Big Chase! (Beginner)- Downtown- Seaside DriveBoss: Bobbie Louise - a muscular gang leader who throws barrels at the player and...he also grabs a truck.File 2: Save the Mayor! (Medium)- On Deck- BridgeBoss: Aero-Divers - five soldiers with jetpacks. They shoot rockets.File 3: Railline Shooutout! (Expert)- Arcade Line- Saturn WayBoss: Garse Bradley - basically it is a general operating a heavily armored tank.After successfully shooting through all three episodes awaits the final battle with 'the Mastermind' - a supervillain wearing a jetpack.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Virtua Fighter</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first in the Virtua Fighter series, the game plays in a 3D format. Both the arcade original's Sega Model 1 hardware and the Saturn port's NV1 architecture relied on quadratic polygons instead of the triangular polygons that are used in modern 3D graphics. The images were created by using wire frames and flat-shaded quads. The game retains it's staple of multiple characters, who all have their own distinctive moves.It differed from other fighting games from the same era as the game relied on only the control stick and three buttons, punch, kick and guard. The game is highly regarded for the real world fighting techniques and it's in-depth fighting engine, and it was as a result viewed as revolutionary when it first came out.Developed by Sega AM2 team, with Yu Suzuki as director and Seiichi Ishii as main designer, the game was hugely influential in popularizing 3D polygon graphics across the video game industry. It inspired a new generation of 3D fighting games, ranging from Tekken and Toshinden to Soul and Dead or Alive. Some of the Sony staff involved in the creation of the PlayStation credit Virtua Fighter as inspiration for the PlayStation's 3D graphical capabilities (see here). More generally, it set a template for early 3D games in general. For example, it was cited as an influence on Tomb Raider.In 1998, Virtua Fighter was recognized by the Smithsonian Institution for contributions in the field of Art and Entertainment, and became a part of the Smithsonian Institution's Permanent Research Collection on Information Technology Innovation.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Akira YukiSarah BryantWolf HawkfieldDuralJacky BryantKage-MaruJeffry McWildLau ChanPai ChanAn Arabian character named Siba was originally scheduled to be featured in the game. His character model did in fact appear on some Virtua Fighter arcade cabinets. He was eventually dropped, but he makes an appearance in Sega Saturn Fighters MegaMix.[CR]Launch Game:[CR]Virtua Fighter was a North American launch game for the Sega Saturn (SS) on May 11, 1995. The game launched alongside other Saturn launch titles that included:* Panzer Dragoon* Daytona USAThat's right, the Saturn launched with only three games in North America.Rushed to meet the Saturn launch, the Saturn version is considered inferior to the Arcade and 32X versions. The game featured lesser graphics and more sluggish gameplay.Sega later released Virtua Fighter Remix, an improved version of the original that came free by mail with registration of a Saturn.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>One year after after the first tournament Akira, Wolf, Pai, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Sarah and defending champion Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.[CR]Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.[CR]While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps  to bring the arcade experience home.</plot>

		<plot>Virtua Fighter Kids is a spinoff of Sega's Virtua Fighter of 3-D fighting games released in 1996. All the characters in the game are rendered in a "super-deformed" art style that makes them appear like characters in a children's cartoon. The feel of the game is more whimsical than other games in the Virtua Fighter series as well.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Virtual Fighter Kids plays like a faster version of Virtua Fighter 2. The gameplay is set up exactly the same; the only real difference between the two, besides the speed, is the art style.The Saturn version of VFK allowed players to program combos onto buttons and also had extra FMV sequences not featured in the arcade version of the game.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Virtua Fighter Kids is considered an oddity among Saturn collectors and Virtua Fighter fans due to its concept and the Japanese version's constant product placement for a drink called Java Tea. The game is not very widely known outside of Virtua Fighter or Saturn fancircles.The VFK versions of Akira and Sarah are playable in the Saturn title Fighters Megamix.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Virtua Racing is an early 3D polygonal racing game that was released in the arcades in 1992 and later on for the Mega Drive / Genesis, Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. The arcade version served as the debut for the Sega Model 1 board, the first in the popular Sega Model series of arcade system boards, and thus Virtua Racing is often seen as the start of the 1990s 3D gaming revolution.Utilizing a dedicated 3D graphics board (much like Namco's System 21), the Sega Model 1 was the most powerful gaming system up until that time, with polygon rendering capabilities and floating-point performance far beyond what other gaming systems at the time were capable of. It was also the first arcade game to represent human characters, though these early human character models looked dated after Virtua Fighter released in 1993.In early 1992, Sega intended to add texture-mapping to the Model 1 system, but were unable to do at the time; they later succeeded in adding filtered texture-mapping to the Sega Model 2 arcade system by late 1993, beginning with Daytona USA, a spiritual successor to Virtua Racing.[CR]Deluxe arcade cabinets[CR]V.R. DXThere was a Deluxe version, known as the V.R. DX cabinet type, which is a single-player machine and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio monitor (the first use of a widescreen aspect ratio monitor in a video game), and 6 airbags (3 on each side) built into the seat that will inflate and "nudge" the player when cornering, and one more airbag on the player's back that inflates under braking. The seat is also adjustable via "forward" and "back" buttons using air pressure. V.R. DX's force-feedback steering also uses two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the steering wheel, which differ from the electric motor-and-clutch system that the upright and twin versions use (which have no inbuilt air system), so the steering feel is quite different.Virtua FormulaA special deluxe cabinet of Virtua Racing was released, called Virtua Formula. At the time, this deluxe cabinet was very expensive (in the UK, for example, it cost as much as &#163;250,000 for the cabinet and &#163;3 per play).This deluxe cabinet featured 4-8 Formula 1 race car replicas, each one with its own large monitor and with the controls in the car corresponding to actions in the game. Each car was hydraulic-powered, where the controls were hydraulically controlled, with even the back axle slipping out when the player skids.The deluxe cabinet supported multiplayer for up to eight players, in contrast to the standard cabinet which supported up to two players. The deluxe cabinet also featured an on-air CCD camera, which passes through each racer, showing their facial expressions on a monitor above the cabinet. It also featured a commentator screen, with an announcer called Virt McPolygon.The deluxe cabinet was powered by two Sega Model 1 arcade boards, in contrast to the standard cabinet which was powered by a single Sega Model 1 board.[CR]Sega Model 1 arcade hardware[CR]ProcessorsCPU (Central Processing Unit) processors: Main CPU: NEC V60 (32-bit RISC) uPD-70616 @ 16 MHz (3.5 MIPS)Sound CPU: Motorola 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 12 MHz (2.1 MIPS)Performance: 5.6 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Main GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and FPU (Floating-Point Unit) co-processor: Main GPU &amp; FPU: Fujitsu TGP MB86233 (32-bit) @ 16 MHzFloating-point performance: 16 MFLOPS (Million Floating-point Operations Per Second)Sound chipsMusic sound chip: Sega MultiPCM (custom 28-channel PCM) @ 8 MHz, 8 MB ROMSound effect chip: Sega MultiPCM (custom 28-channel PCM) @ 8 MHz, 8 MB ROMSound timing chip: Yamaha YM3834 (FM Synthesis) @ 8 MHzGraphical capabilitiesGPU abilities: Floating decimal point operation function, axis rotation operation function, 3D matrix operation functionVideo: Shading, flat shading, diffuse reflection, specula reflection, two layers of background scrolling, alpha channelPerformance: CPU performance: 5.6 MIPS (2x CPU)Floating-point performance: 16 MFLOPS (FPU)Geometry: 180,000 polygons per second, 540,000 vectors per secondRendering: 1,200,000 pixels per secondResolution: 512 x 384 pixelsColours on screen: 16-bit colour (65,536 colours)Virtua FormulaThe Virtua Formula deluxe cabinet later released in 1993 used an additional second Sega Model 1 arcade board to power the game. This essentially doubled the system's performance.CPU performance: 11.2 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Floating-point performance: 32 MFLOPS (Million Floating-point Operations Per Second)Geometry: 360,000 polygons per second, 1.08 million vectors per secondRendering: 2.4 million pixels per second[CR]Console ports[CR]The technology for the game was considered ahead of its time, which resulted in a larger than average Mega Drive / Genesis cart (although perfectly compatible with all Mega Drive / Genesis models) and a higher than average price tag (around $100 in the US).The 32X version of the game, named Virtua Racing Deluxe, was released in 1994 . It performed much closer to its arcade counterpart and included two extra cars ("Stock" and "Prototype") and two new tracks ("Highland" and "Sand Park"). The game was not as popular as its Mega Drive / Genesis predecessor, due to the poor sales of the 32X.The Sega Saturn version, an arcade-perfect port, was published in 1995 by Time Warner Interactive. The Saturn release has the game soundtrack, which can be listened to in any CD player. The Saturn version also includes ten new courses and four new cars. Unlike other versions, it features Grand Prix mode, where players drive a series of cars and the tracks to earn points. The Grand Prix mode has other vehicles such as go-karts, formula 1 cars, and a prototype concept car.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The hero of this game is a young man who enjoys playing video games (don't we all?..). One fine day, he rents a new game; after firing it up, a princess appears on the screen, calling for help. A moment later, a demonic hand reaches to the hero and pulls him into the TV! The hero is teleported into an alternate world, a kingdom that is a mixture of medieval and modern day-like environment. This world is in danger, and only those who have the magical "voice power" can save it! The hero meets the young female magician named Whip and the princess of the country, Fret; together, they must stop the evil and figure out a way for the hero to go back to his world.[CR]Voice Fantasia might look like an RPG, but in reality its gameplay is much closer to the adventure variety, the RPG elements reducing to a mini game-like status. Most of the gameplay here is dedicated to exploring the world, talking to characters, and acquiring and using items needed to advance the story. The infrequent turn-based battles are dictated by the story. Three girls join the party, and are able to use "voice powers", which are in effect attacks of various properties. There is no experience system of any kind.[CR]There is also a mild "dating simulation" element in the game. The player is able to buy presents for the girls, invite them for dinner, etc. When staying at the hotel, those anime-style fantasy characters are replaced by video footage of real voice actresses. The player is able to talk to them and ask a variety of questions.</plot>

		<title_clean>WWF In Your House</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF in Your House is a wrestling game developed by Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City (formerly Sculptured Software) and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation, and PC platforms.WWF in Your House is the follow up to WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game, which was developed by Sculptured Software, and published by Midway Entertainment the previous year. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Like its predecessor, WWF in Your House was heavily influenced by Midway's Mortal Kombat franchise. Departing from earlier 16-bit era WWF licensed games developed by Sculptured Software, such as WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw, WWF in Your House uses digitized sprites and focuses on fast paced, strike and combo based fighting, common to the fighting games at the time.Unlike earlier titles which grounded the gameplay in "realistic" deliberately paced grappling and momentum based combat, the action in WWF in Your House is quick and over the top, with weapons appearing out of nowhere, characters morphing shape, and characters using lightening and fire attacks. Like other games in the fighting genre, WWF in Your House also features character-specific attacks and stages. For example, the British Bulldog's list of moves includes the Union Jack Attack and his stage appears to be in front of Buckingham Palace. In game commentary is provided by Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect.Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City would abandon the digitized sprite style for polygonal 3D models and over the top action for grapple based combat in its 1998 follow up title WWF War Zone.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>WWF WrestleMania - The Arcade Game</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game is an exaggerated fighting game that uses digitized sprites of the featured professional wrestlers, similar to Mortal Kombat. Players battle through one-on-one, one-on-two, and one-on-three matches to claim either the Intercontinental Championship or WWF Heavyweight Championship. Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler provided commentary and the game was later ported to home consoles by Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City, which would make the successor title, WWF in Your House.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]The UndertakerShawn MichaelsBret HartRazor RamonLex LugerBam Bam Bigelow (Not playable in the SNES version)Yokozuna (Not playable in the SNES version)Doink The Clown[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Developed by Midway, WWF Wrestlemania plays similarly to Mortal Kombat, with a few exceptions. Characters can move in somewhat 3-D space, in that you can walk up and down, as well as left and right. Combat features 5 buttons, Light Punch, Power Punch, Light Kick, Power Kick and Block. It is also possible to Run by pressing Light Punch and Light Kick together.The main game consists of the player choosing to go after the Intercontinental title or the World Wrestling Federation Title. In the Intercontinental Title challenge, you'll face 4 opponents via 1-on-1 matches, followed by two 2-on-1 matches, and finally a 3-on-1 match. In the WWF Title Challenge, you'll start out with four 2-on-1 matches, moving on to two 3-on-1 matches, and finally the "Wrestlemania Challenge", a gauntlet match against every wrestler in the game. In the final match, however, only 4 people (including yourself) will be in the ring at once. Once you eliminate an opponent, someone will replace them until you've beaten all eight opponents.Each character has a unique ending.The only known "finishing move", similar to a Fatality, is done by the Undertaker. Originally the game was scheduled to have finishing moves for each character, but the WWF shot down the plan.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Whizz is a platformer developed by Flair Software Ltd., a UK developer, for a multitude of systems. It was originally released for PC DOS in 1994, before being ported to the SNES, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and the Commodore Amiga as well as the Amiga's CD-based equivalent the Amiga CD32.Whizz stars the titular character Whizz, a rabbit dressed in a magician's outfit, being chased by his arch-nemesis Ratty in his blimp.He has to escape Ratty through 4 worlds:South Seas BeachesFrozen Arctic WasteGreen Grassed CastleIndoor World of GamesvilleAnd ultimately reach his own Hot Air Balloon at the end of each level.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Whizz is viewed from an isometric view, its levels are timed and littered with enemies and obstacles; Whizz has a jump and spin attack to deal with these. Throughout each level there are special "Doors" which are made of a specific material (Ice, Wood, Brick and Iron) these can be broken by a spin attack if the player has the "Door Breaker", which is effectively a "key" that is made up of the same material of the door. Only one key can be carried at a time so in later levels backtracking is necessary.Each time an enemy is killed it has a chance of dropping a Red or Blue Mushroom (Red heals, Blue poisons), certain enemies are indestructible, these are indicated by red and white markings. Hourglasses increase the amount of time left in the level, while Gems and Flags give points (200 and 50 respectively) and collected Flags provide a point bonus at the end of the level.In each level of a world (there are four levels for each world) there is a hidden Rocket, which will award 1000 points for launching it and an extra life when all four are launched in a world.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Wing Arms is action/shooter starring airplanes mainly from the WW2 era. There is very little simulation here as you shoot your way through levels where usually your mission is to shoot everyone, or to bomb certain targets. Night missions add to the variety. Gameplay is similar to the Wing Commander series, and is intended to be easy to play but hard to master.</plot>

		<plot>Winning Post lets the player take control of a stable of horse, breeding and training them for the ultimate goal, to win the French Grand Prix.[CR]The player can hire breeders, trainers and jockeys and race in over 240 different races to earn more money to buy even better personnel and breed faster and stronger horses as well as keeping their horses healthy.  Players can also bet on races as well.[CR]The gameplay consists of choosing options before races, such as choosing which horses to train and what regiment they undertake, view stats, hire personnel and place bets.  However the player has no controls over races and cannot participate and only view as a spectator.</plot>

		<title_clean>Winter Heat</title_clean>
		<plot>Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena). [CR]The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:[CR]1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.[CR]2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).[CR]3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.[CR]4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.[CR]5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.[CR]6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.[CR]7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a "click-along" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses[CR]8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.[CR]9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.[CR]10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.[CR]11. Cross Country:[CR] The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.</plot>

		<title_clean>Worldwide Soccer - Sega International Victory Goal Edition</title_clean>
		<plot>International Victory Goal was Sega's first attempt at a 32-bit soccer game outside the Japanese market, one of the first Saturn sports games released and the predecessor to Worldwide Soccer 97 and 98.[CR]Focused on national teams (12, including Italy, Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, England, Argentina, France, USA, Germany, Romania, Belgium and Brazil), the game offers a 2.5D  environment (polygonal stadium and sprites for players) and three camera angles (back, isometric and side) with four zooming levels. Modes include Exhibition, World League (either single or double, with 44 matches and a grand final to crown the Grand Champion), S-League (just one round, 11 matches), cup knockout and penalty shootout, the game keeping track of statistical information of each competition. Gameplay is regular arcade, with simplicity being privileged over tactical knowledge or complex controls, with the game offering the possibility to choose between three types of controls. Other options include the ability to choose one of four difficulty levels, length of each half (3, 6 or 15 minutes) and weather conditions (fine, rain or random).</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Worms' Main Menu (DOS)Originally created by Andy Davidson for the Amiga, and later ported to a variety of other systems by Team17, Worms is the first iteration of the long-running Worms series of turn-based strategic artillery games. As in subsequent games, the goal of Worms is to use a team of well-armed annelids to kill worms of opposing human or A.I. players; in each round, the last player with living worms is declared the winner. Worms was first published by Ocean Software Ltd. in 1995, and in addition to its original platform, it has appeared on the Amiga CD32, PC, Game Boy, Genesis, Jaguar, Macintosh, PlayStation, Saturn, and SNES; in fact, it has been ported to more systems than any other Worms game. A version of the title was even considered for Nintendo's Virtual Boy at one point, though Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown stated in 2008 that the Virtual Boy port never truly made it into the development stages due to a sentiment that the platform was "doomed to failure".The DOS version of Worms was followed up by Worms: Reinforcements, an expansion to the original game, in late 1995; the following year Worms and Reinforcements would be released as a single package under the name Worms United. Worms would later be released on Steam in 2011 and GOG.com in 2012, though in both cases the version sold is Worms United, not the original game. After completing Worms Davidson would also head up the development of Worms: The Director's Cut, released in 1997, which was an Amiga-exclusive version of Worms that featured a large number of new weapons and game options not previously seen in other iterations of the game, many of which were adopted in Worms 2, released the same year. Both 2006's Worms: Open Warfare and 2007's Worms are considered remakes of the original Worms due in large part to similarities in their weapon loadouts.[CR]Development[CR]Worms was originally conceived not as a commercial product, but as a distraction for creator Andy Davidson, a fan of local multiplayer games like Bomberman and Super Mario Kart, and his high school friends. It was initially built using borrowed assets from Psygnosis' Lemmings, and the earliest version of Worms was known as Lemartillery as a result. The game eventually became so popular among the students of Davidson's school that it was banned entirely, prompting Davidson to consider the possibility of having his game published. In order to make the game more attractive to would-be publishers, however, the game's graphics had to be reworked, and thus Davidson scrapped the original lemmings on favor of worms, giving this new iteration the name Total Wormage. Davidson was so intent on getting his game published that after high school he decided to forgo the pursuit of higher education in order to do so. While he continued to work on the game, Davidson used the customers of an Amiga store where he worked as a form of playtesting for Total Wormage.In one of his efforts to get his game noticed, Davidson submitted Total Wormage into a competition held by Amiga Format, a British Amiga magazine. By Davidson's own admission, though, his entry into the contest did not accomplish what he had hoped, as he neither won nor received any mention in the magazine. Although discouraged by this and a number of failed attempts at garnering attention for Total Wormage by mailing copies to publishers and developers, Davidson had one final idea: to take the game to the European Computer Trade Show in London. This would prove to be the turning point in Davidson's fortunes, as while there he demoed the game to Team17, who showed an immediate interest in it. Team17 offered to help Davidson develop and publish the game; much of their work went into porting Worms to other game systems, as the original Amiga version that Davidson had been working on was by this time fairly well-developed. In total, Davidson estimates that he spent about four years of his life in the development of Worms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Worms consists of actions taken by between two and four teams of human- or A.I.-controlled worms on a two-dimensional playing field. The game is turn-based, with each player being able to move a single worm per turn; turns typically end once a worm has either fired a weapon or sustained damage, although they can also end automatically if the allotted time for a turn runs out. From there, play shifts to the next player in the sequence, which is determined randomly at the beginning of gameplay, and that player proceeds in the same fashion. The objective of worms at all times is to cause as much damage to enemy worms as possible while also preserving one's own worms. Each worms starts the round with a certain amount of hit points (typically one hundred), and if their hit points are reduced to zero, they will die, leaving behind a gravestone and creating a small explosion that can harm nearby worms. Worms can also be killed instantaneously by being knocked outside the boundaries of the level or into liquid substances that reside at the bottom of the stage. If a player loses all four of their worms, they are eliminated, and the winner of a given round is the player that survives the match without being eliminated.A Banana Bomb causing widespread destruction. At top, opposing players' health bars can be seen; within the lower HUD, a wind strength indicator (top right) and power bar (bottom right) are visible.Each player starts the match with an assortment of armaments and utilities in order to aid them in their goal of dominating their opposition. This includes staple weapons such as bazookas and grenades, which can be used frequently, to more powerful weaponry such as homing missiles and dynamite that can only be used a finite number of times. Worms also contains a handful of "super weapons" such as banana bombs and explosive sheep, which can only be obtained through periodic weapon crate drops during a match; these items are extremely potent, though incredibly rare to find. Some weapons require that the player be able to accurately gauge the proper weapon trajectory and launch power necessary to hit a target, which can be further complicated by the inclusion of wind conditions that can affect certain projectiles while in flight. In addition to weapons, Worms also offers a number of movement utilities designed more for defense or traversal than offense; this includes items like ninja ropes and teleporters, which allow different ways of moving around the environment, and items like blow torches and pneumatic drills that can carve through obstructions.Environments in Worms are completely destructible, and almost all weapons cause some amount of deformation to the terrain. Over time, this reduces the size of the overall play area, making defensive positioning increasingly difficult while simultaneously increasing the danger that players will fall or be forced off of the map. In order to help make the game more replayable, levels in Worms are also randomly generated, and prior to a match players can cycle through maps indefinitely until they find one to their liking. Several other aspects of the game are adjustable as well, though not all of these variables have a dramatic affect on gameplay. Team and individual worm names can be changed, starting hit point totals can be set between seventy-five and five hundred points, and the intelligence level of A.I. opponents can be tweaked. The availability of all of the game's default weapons can be tailored to suit personal tastes, and Sudden Death, a late-game stalemate breaker that reduces all worms to one hit point, can be made to occur sooner, later, or not at all. A number of other variables exist as well, such as default worm placement and turn length, and an optional Banzai mode is also included which makes explosions even more destructive.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The Worms arsenal includes more than twenty weapons and utilities that vary in strength and purpose. All but three of these tools are given automatically to the player during a match, while the others are designated as "super weapons," and must be collected from randomized weapon crates (although these crates can also contain other weapons or booby traps). A wide variety of different armaments are represented in Worms, including melee weapons, firearms, and a variety of explosives that may be thrown, dropped, propelled by rockets, or conveyed in less-than-orthodox ways. Some usable items are classified as utilities, and while these objects may cause damage to enemies in some cases, the intent of utility items is generally to offer worms additional mobility or defensive options. Weapons can be selected either by right-clicking in order to bring up a weapon selection panel or by hitting their associated function key.BazookaBazookaDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 One of the go-to weapons of Worms, the Bazooka fires a single explosive shell in a trajectory and at a velocity determined by the player. Provided that it successfully finds its target, it does a solid amount of damage and causes a fair amount of concussive force as well. It also destroys a sizable chunk of the surrounding landscape. Bazooka usage is unlimited by default, and it can be extremely useful to skilled players. Its course is heavily influenced by wind, however, requiring some amount of compensation in gusty conditions.Homing MissileHoming MissileDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 (2x) The Homing Missile is similar to the Bazooka in many respects, though it has one crucial difference. Prior to being fired, the player is able to select a point on the map that the Homing Missile will zero in on after it takes flight. Though it's tracking capability is far from perfect, with foresight it can be used to hit almost any target that is not hidden underground. Due to the increased accuracy over the Bazooka, it is easier to propel worms in a desired direction with it, though just like the Bazooka it is affected by wind.GrenadeGrenadeDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F2 Being equal in strength to the Bazooka, the Grenade is another of Worms' staple weapons, and similarly it is a deadly weapon in the hands of a seasoned player. One of the Grenade's main advantages is the fact that it is not affected by wind at all, and thus two Grenades thrown at the same angle and strength will always have the same trajectory. A Grenade also does not explode on impact, but instead possesses an adjustable fuse that automatically detonates it after a preselected number of seconds (between one and five).Cluster BombCluster BombDamage: Up to 25 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Cluster Bomb takes after the Grenade in terms of its low susceptibility to wind and adjustable fuse length. Once the fuse is detonated, it splits into five distinct explosives that scatter and fall to the ground, causing additional damage to any worms within a short vicinity of the initial blast. While each individual explosion is less damaging than the force of a Grenade, combined they can cause far greater damage. The natural target for a Cluster Bomb is not a single worm but a gathering of enemy worms situated fairly close to each other.Banana BombBanana BombDamage: Up to 75 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Banana Bomb can be thought of as a version of the Cluster Bomb, though a far more destructive one. After a Banana Bomb has been thrown and its timer expires, five deadly bananas are unleashed that fly into the air and explode immediately upon contact with the ground. Each banana is akin to a single stick of Dynamite, and the combined detonation can kill several worms, or even an entire team of worms, relatively easily. Due to its potentially enormous area of effect, the Banana Bomb is a frequent source of self-injury.ShotgunShotgunDamage: Up to 25 HP per shotHotkey: F3 The Shotgun is one of three point-and-shoot firearm weapons in Worms, and its main distinction over its brethren is the ability to shoot twice in a single turn. Even though the damage it causes with each shot is somewhat on the low side, it affords some strategic possibilities that are not possible with other weapons. A player can use it, for example, to attack two different worms in a single turn even if they are not close to one another; alternately, it can be used to attack once before using the remainder of the turn to seek a defensive position.UziUziDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) Using the Uzi unleashes a short stream of bullets in a specified direction. If all hits connect, it causes a significant amount of damage, and there are other benefits to the weapon as well, as it creates a significant amount of pushback that can be used to propel enemy worms into hazards such as mines or water. The downside of this property is that it is at times difficult to get the maximum amount of damage from the weapon. Perhaps the best way to ensure this is to use the Uzi against enemies that have their backs against a wall.MinigunMinigunDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) The Minigun is essentially a more deadly version of the Uzi, and as such its applications are fairly similar. Like the Uzi, it is unlikely that all bullets will hit their target unless said worm is pinned against a solid surface, though the damage boost of the Minigun makes this drawback less of an issue. It is an extremely good tool for pushing worms around the landscape and into peril. Because of its wide bullet spread, the Minigun is best used from close range, though care should be taken, as it is possible to damage oneself with it.Fire PunchFire PunchDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 Upon activating the Fire Punch ability, a worm will unleash a Street Fighter-inspired Dragon Punch that damages an opponent and sends them flying across the map. The trajectory of the Fire Punch's knockback is arguably its most advantageous attribute, as the actual injury caused by the attack is somewhat modest. More often than not, the Fire Punch is either used to knock an opponent off of a precipice, hopefully to their death, or as a stylish way of finishing off a worm that is nearly dead already. It can also strike worms above the player.Dragon BallDragon BallDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 (2x) The Dragon Ball ability creates a short-range fireball that damages the first worm it touches. It is similar to the Fire Punch in many ways, and even does the same amount of damage on hit, though it is more horizontally oriented. This goes not only for the attack itself, which travels horizontally as opposed to the Fire Punch's vertical movement, but also the result of the attack. Enemies hit by a Dragon Ball will be thrown a great distance but will not gain much altitude, which can be used to great effect to push worms into mines or water.DynamiteDynamiteDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 A simple yet undeniably powerful weapon, the Dynamite stick is a dropped explosive device with an extremely large blast radius. Since it must be placed manually, the user is required afterwards to beat a hasty retreat lest they fall victim to their own destructive predilections. It leaves a very large crater in its wake, and any worms within its range when it detonates sustain heavy damage. Dynamite is the most potent weapon in Worms that is not considered to be a "super weapon," and by default it is available in very limited supply.MineMineDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Deployed in the same manner as the Dynamite stick, the Mine may be a step down in terms of power, but it has uses that Dynamite does not. It can of course be placed directly on top of a worm so that it will activate and explode immediately, but it can also be used as a defensive tool, which can be particularly useful in securing underground tunnels. Against A.I opponents, its defensive utility is somewhat diminished, as computer worms tend to move around far less than human ones, reducing the chances of mine activation significantly.SheepSheepDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Seemingly innocuous at a glance, the Sheep is in truth one of the deadliest weapons in Worms. Once released, the Sheep will amble along while trying to bound over any obstacles it might encounter. When the fire button is pressed a second time, the Sheep will detonate, creating a blast equal to Dynamite in terms of its size and lethality. The Sheep negates one of the primary drawbacks of Dynamite, that being that players must place it themselves; Sheep can have some difficulty navigating uneven terrain, though, so flat surfaces work best.Air StrikeAir StrikeDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F6 Calling in an Air Strike orders an aircraft to perform a bombing run over a targeted area. When initiated, the player is asked to select a target zone in a manner similar to the target selection of the Homing Missile; in the case of the Air Strike, the selected point is then used as the bull's eye for an immediate missile bombardment. Explosives fall in a fairly large area around the target, making it an attractive way to cause heavy damage to a large cluster of worms, though it does require a fairly clear path to its target in order to be effective.TeleportTeleportDamage: NoneHotkey: F6 (2x) The Worms equivalent of a Get Out of Jail Free card, the Teleport instantaneously transports a single worm to any point on the map the player so desires. This can be used in situations where a worm is surrounded by hostile worms, and it is also a popular way to collect weapon crates. Using a teleport immediately ends the worm's turn, so it is important to ensure that doing so will not leave the player vulnerable to attack in subsequent turns. As the most powerful movement tool in the game, its use is severely restricted by default.Blow TorchBlow TorchDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 The Blow Torch allows a worm to carve into the environment either horizontally or at an angle. While it does cause a pittance of damage to worms in its path, the primary purpose of the Blow Torch is in tunneling through the map to reach new areas or building underground defensive structures that shield worms against attack. This is a particularly vexing problem for opposing worms, as burrowed worms can't be attacked easily in many scenarios, often forcing players to waste several turns in an attempt to infiltrate or destroy enemy defenses.DrillDrillDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 (2x) Unlike the Blow Torch, the Drill burrows into the environment in only one direction: down. Though this is not intended for offensive purposes, it has more damage potential than the Blow Torch, as a worm can in some cases become stuck in the hole created by the Drill and continue to take damage. Unfortunately, worms who use the Drill to escape enemy fire are more vulnerable to attack than those hidden in horizontal tunnels. This is because it is a fairly simple matter to drop a Grenade, Cluster Bomb, or other ordinance on their heads.Ninja RopeNinja RopeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 Aside from walking and jumping, the Ninja Rope is arguably the most important means of locomotion in Worms. Casting a Ninja Rope will attach a worm to any solid surface via rope, and from there the player is free to extend and retract the rope and also swing back and forth to gain momentum. In this way players are able to rapidly traverse large sections of the map and access areas that might otherwise be inaccessible. Most importantly, using the Ninja Rope does not end the player's turn, leaving worms free to attack their foes afterwards.BungeeBungeeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 (2x) Having the Bungee utility selected allows the player the freedom to walk off of cliffs without fear of sustaining fall damage. Dropping from a precipice activates the item automatically, and from there the player can control their movements on the Bungee cord. It behaves somewhat like a springier version of the Ninja Rope, and like the Ninja Rope the player can detach from it at any time by hitting the fire button. The player's turn does not end once the worm dismounts the cord, so the remainder of their turn can be played out as normal.GirderGirderDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 Offering a number of strategic possibilities, the Girder utility is the only usable item in Worms that creates a terrain feature rather than destroying one. Using a Girder allows the player to place a long solid metal beam that acts like all other solid objects in the game. For allied worms, this can be a useful means of protection or a way to assist mobility, and it can also be used as a way to restrict the movements of enemy worms. Girders can have their orientation rotated at will and their size adjusted prior to being placed on the map.KamikazeKamikazeDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F10 True to its name, the Kamikaze attack is a one-way proposition for any worm that chooses to utilize it. The idea is that the worm in question will fly forth and explode violently, causing damage to enemy worms while sending them flying. Since worms are the player's most valued resource, it is a tool to be avoided if at all possible. The ideal candidate for a Kamikaze attack is a worm that is near death and would likely die before their next turn anyway. Even so, it is usually only worth considering if the blast will affect multiple worms.ProdProdDamage: NoneHotkey: F11 The Prod is the ultimate Worms insult: an attack that does no damage. By standing next to another worm and issuing a Prod command, the player's worm will give a gently nudge to the adjacent worm that will push them forward ever so slightly. Nothing more, nothing less. The only practical application of this ability is in the event that an enemy worm can be pushed off of or into something, and even then there are weapons that can accomplish the same while also causing damage directly. It is used primarily to humiliate an opponent.Skip GoSkip GoDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 (2x) As it implies, Skip Go allows a player to prematurely end their worm's turn without taking any further action. This can be useful if a worm has no viable means of attack or if the player simply wishes to force their opponent's hand. If a worm is burrowed safely underground, for instance, a player might decide to skip their turn rather than risk retaliation by leaving and going on the offensive. Skipping a turn also has the effect of allowing more turns before the onset of Sudden Death, which is activated based on play time rather than turn count.SurrenderSurrenderDamage: NoneHotkey: F10 (2x) By selecting Surrender and pressing the fire button a player can at any point raise the proverbial white flag and remove themselves from play voluntarily. In a two-player match, this ends the round automatically, though if two or more players remain after a Surrender then play will continue until only one team remains. It should be noted that surrendered worms will remain on the playing field even after they are no longer in competition; aside from their lack of any agency in the match, these worms behave as they normally would.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Worms was fairly well-received upon its release in 1995, and many critics commending it for having easy-to-grasp yet strategic gameplay, a humorous, lighthearted presentation, and a great deal of customization options and replayability. The original version received a great deal of positive attention from the Amiga gaming press, with a large number of review scores falling within the ninetieth percentile. Ironically, Amiga Format, the very same British publication that had failed to acknowledge Davidson's game when he submitted it into their yearly Amiga game competition, issued a glowing post-release review of Worms in their 1995 Christmas issue, saying that it "thoroughly deserves to be a real smash."[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]X-Men: Children of the Atom is the first fighting game by Capcom that uses characters from the Marvel universe. Playing much like Street Fighter, it also used the voice actors from the animated series to voice their characters for the game. Released originally in 1994 in arcades, then the game was later ported to the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. This game was also praised for using the costumes and color schemes from the 1990s cartoon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]X-Men: Children of the Atom start screen.The gameplay for X-Men Children of the Atom follows closely to Capcoms Street Fighter II, and Darkstalkers using the same arcade button configuration and style. You can pick from six heroes and four villains for a total of ten playable characters.Each player has an "X-Power" gauge similar to that of Super Street Fighter II Turbo as well as the "Special" gauge in Darkstalkers. The "X-Power" gauge builds up as the player performs moves during a match and has two levels, in which the player can then perform "X-Ability" which uses a smaller amount of the gauge and the "Hyper-X" which uses a lot more of the power gauge. Alos, countering throws will also drain some of your power gauge.Wolverine Fighting IcemanX-Men Children of the Atom also introduces to fighting games, the ability to do super jumps, roll toward or away from an opponent after a throw to perform more attacks, and also being able to determine projectile attacks, such as Cyclops' Eye Beam. As well the player can choose between manual or automatic blocking, but some in game features will not be available if the player chooses automatic.The single player portion of the game has six AI controlled characters ,and two unplayable boss characters. Unlike most fighting games their is no mirror matches. Akuma (from Super Street Fighter II Turbo) makes an appearance in the single player as a secret character if the proper requirements are met.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]X-MenColossusHe is the strongest member from X-Men. His stage is underneath a city being destroyed by Sentinels.CyclopsCyclops uses mainly optic blasts. His stage is located in the Danger Room.IcemanHis stage is ice pieces floating across a tropical beach.PsylockeHer stage is located in an elevator revolving around a skyscraper.StormStorm is the only X-Men character that can fly, and attacks using wind, ice and lighting attacks. Her stage is located on top of the Blackbird.WolverineHe can heal part of his health. Wolverines' stage is in the Savage Land.VillainsOmega RedHis stage is in an undersea laboratory.SentinelHe is the largest regular character to choose from. His stage is located in a Sentinel Factory in Genosha, in which Master Mold, who is seen in the background, will either fly away or get destroyed depending if the Sentinels win the match or not.Silver SamuraiHis stage is located in Kodokan.SpiralHer stage is in the Mojo World. Her stage has a different design, as the floor can be destroyed up to three times in a match.BossesJuggernautHe is the first boss in the game. His stage is located in a space ship launching bayMagnetoHe is the final boss in the game. His stage is located in Avalon, his space station.Secret CharacterAkuma (Gouki in Japan)He is a character from Super Street Fighter II Turbo, and uses the same sprites from that game. His stage is also located in the Danger Room. Akuma can be selected at the character selection screen using a specific cheat code.[CR]Hardware[CR]X-Men Children of the Atom Arcade Hardwarelike many Capcom games of the time X-Men Children of the Atom ran on CPS-2 arcade hardware, and featured the same arcade panel layout as previous Capcom developed fighting games, the only difference being different artwork and button colors.[CR]Ports[CR]The PSX Box Art in North AmericaA Sega Saturn version was was released in Japan on November 22, 1995 by Capcom, and released in North America and Europe by Acclaim a few months later. The Saturn version was developed by Rutubo Games, and allows the player to enter a cheat code in two player versus mode that allows you to play as the boss characters.PlayStation and PC versions were release in 1998 and 1997 and were released in North America and Europe, and were developed by Probe Entertainment and was published by Acclaim.[CR]</plot>
