		<emu_comment>EasyRPG is a free and open source role playing game interpreter compatible with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003.[CR]RPG Maker, known in Japan as RPG Tsukuru, is the name of a series of programs for the development of role-playing games (RPGs) first created by the Japanese group ASCII, then succeeded by Enterbrain. The Japanese name, Tsukuru, is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru, which means "make" or "create", with tsuru, the Japanese transcription of the English word "tool".[CR]The RPG Maker series has been released primarily in Japan, with later versions also released in East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia.[CR]Since its first release, RPG Maker has been used to create numerous titles, both free and commercial.  Hundreds of commercial games created using RPG Maker have been released on Steam, for example.</emu_comment>

		<plot>An intro on 1899 London Gothic, a German game created with RPG Maker. As its name suggests, its history takes place in London in the Gothic period in the late nineteenth century. The protagonist of this game is a police investigator, and as the video shows us, he presents many animated scenes through picture.[CR]Created by Grandy, this game was developed mainly on RPG Maker 2003, where it seems to have been interrupted and then returned to the XP version.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: X-Tech[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR]I would like to introduce my game translated MOSTLY by Pantera from our polish rpgmaker scene. Its inspired by Pacman, The Matrix Movie, Dragon Quest, Chiptune music, and fueled with my ideas.[CR]The game has a funny storyline, a retro atmopshere, but my priority while making it was the gameplay.[CR]The game is based on three segments: normal attack, time attack, and monster attack. Levels feature extra lives to be found and Sword power-ups, similar to Pacmans Power Pellet (the big one, allowing you to eat ghosts).[CR]When you finish a level, points are awarded for the items collected, monsters killed, combos (collecting several items in a row). You lose points for the number of steps you made. You are also awarded gold which you can spend in the shop.[CR]Finishing the time and monster attack segments is not required to finish the game. You are however rewarded for finishing them with a special skill![CR]The shop allows you to buy skills and devices that will aid you during the game. These are:[CR]Super Dash (avoid enemies while running),[CR]Hyper Jump (cruch enemies Mario style),[CR]Controller (deactivate all traps for a moment),[CR]Teleporter (teleports into a safe place),[CR]Freezer (freezes all enemies), and[CR]Extra Life (an extra chance to beat a level).[CR]A hidden feature, not mentioned in the game is the Matrix Mode - activated by pressing "0", it slows down the world, but not the player (simillar to Bullet Time). It lowers the amount of points you get, but can make you life a bit easier.[CR]Hope you enjoy and please comment!</plot>

It has three to four hours of gameplay beyond the end of the previous release, which was entitled THE LINE NARROWS.[CR]What was originally one game has been split into two due to the release of RMXP, so Im marking ABL 2.1 as Complete. Dont laugh! The second half of the game will be released in RMXP as LINES END, and will have a separate entry on RMN.[CR]Okay, now you can laugh. ^_^</plot>

The tables[CR]of balance has been turned, and the fate of the world trusted[CR]into a familiar face. The guardian of zone 0 himself,  The Judge.  Your job is to lead him on a new journey, masterful  [B]puppeteer[/B] . [CR]This world is wrapped in an enigma, a shroud of confusion overlapped the[CR]once peaceful zones. The true guardian of zone 0 himself has the very marrow[CR]of his bones rattled with the feelings of  Deja Vu . The day that he would become the  marionette  of the new world is coming, and upon your very arrival the world will undergo otherworldly changes. [CR]Just what is going on in this world? Why has the switch been reset? Has  The Judge  forgotten everything that happened? Has the world been reversed to a state of pristine ignorance? Only you can find out, fateful  [B]puppeteer[/B].  You will travel the world, and meet the guardians you know so well. However, you will face enemies and foes unlike anything youve imagined. New allies will join your side, and new personalities will be explored. New places will be visited, a zone that defies the logic and reason of the world you know. Puzzles that expand beyond the game and into our world. You will become one with your  puppet , and in your combined state you will bring the land to the closure it deserves. The fate, and the direction of that closure however, is up to the decisions you make. Choose wisely my friend, its up to you to save their  HOME.  [CR] HOME  is a non-canonical fangame created with the permission of Mortis Ghosts, the creator of OFF - the game from which  HOME  was inspired. You take control of  The Judge  in this project, and see the world through his eyes.[CR]New characters and enemies are introduced in this story, with a combat system thats more threatening and challenging than OFFs style.  HOME  makes uses of the elements and status effect system and stretches is as far as possible. Its recommended you play Mortis Ghosts "OFF" before you touch this project, as this game and its entirety is connected and continued after OFF. Playing  HOME  without first playing OFF will not only lead to spoilers but will lead you to a path of confusion and detachment from the entire world.[CR]The game features custom sprites, music, icons, sound effects, and battle animations. It uses as much fresh resources where and whenever possible.</plot>

Hedros certainly seems an upstanding, moral man, but... is the Church really representing the White Lady Erindel, or is there something more to it? Will Trent follow the moral code of the Church, or start a path full of darkness?[CR] Darkness is in everyone, after all... [CR][B]Features[/B]  [CR]- Highly detailed world setting, lore, and plot.[CR]- Fully working Caterpillar System[CR]- Visible enemies, touch to battle.  Enemies will chase you if they are aggressive, run from you if they fear you, or just be dismissive if theyre neutral.[CR]- Well developed characters, each with distinctive personality, interests and motivations.[CR]- A serious attempt at breaking down cliches (Or at least at making a dent on them).[CR]- Mostly original graphics (Heavily edited).[CR]- A default battle system with added flavor (Ranged attacks, chanting on spells, etc.).</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Cernus[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B]A Traitor's Hold is a short prequel to The Difficult Second Quest and tells the story of the "legendary" Tybalt and his party. This was submitted for the Golden Week of RM2k3 event and therefore was made in a week using only RTP.[CR]Tybalt and his party are coming to the end of their journey where they must face off against the Dark Lord. [CR]However, due to recruiting the help of a priest who doesn't seem to have any real powers - and consequently having to sell all their best equipment in order to pay for all the recovery items needed to keep him alive - the party find themselves at the gates of the Dark Lord's tower prepared for the final showdown armed only with a damp rag on a stick and a rusty spoon. [CR]While the Dark Lord ravages the Kingdom of Bieune, the brave heroes decide the best course of action is to walk away from his Tower and instead undertake menial sidequests in order to find themselves better equipment and hopefully learn some new skills. [CR]FEATURES [CR]Class Orb System- Each party member has a defined class, but by equipping Class Orbs they can learn a new command, skill or passive that is appropriate to their class and contains the flavour of the class contained within the orb. For more information regarding Class Orbs, please view the Ability Guide.[CR]Dexterity System- Characters can hit multiple times with the !Attack command based on their Luck stat and the Dexterity of their equipped weapon.[CR]Summoning- There are three hidden bosses in the game. Find and defeat them to learn new summons![CR]Blue Magic- By mastering the Thief Orb, the White Mage gains the ability to cast Blue Magic. Blue Magic can be learned from enemies.[CR]Non-linear gameplay- There are many different locations available to the player once the first dungeon is completed. These areas can be explored in any order the player wishes</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: auroren_sky[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] This long lost tale recently recovered from a 1 GB flash drive tells the story of The Master, after his labors were completed here on Earth (an account of which is given in ActRaiser), retired from this mortal realm and left his work in the hands of another, who would one day come again to guide the peoples to peace. Here the story begins with the figure who has emerged as The Masters successor, Kefka.[CR]This game is similar to the old SNES classic ActRaiser (its more or less a parody of the game). ActRaiser combined different genres into one game -- action platforming with a little city building sim mode and some RPG elements as well. In this version Ive replaced the blood-pumping ultra-exciting action platforming sequences with more suitable RPGMaker2k3 sequences :D</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Neok[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Alter A.I.L.A. Genesis takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. You play the role of a young man known as Leon, who seeks to survive in the harsh environment he is brought into.[CR]Exploration is done mainly via a side-scrolling view. In certain areas, an exclamation mark will sometimes appear, indicating the presence of hostiles. Press Z when this happens to initiate battle, or wait to let it pass. Sometimes battle will be unavoidable. When walking, enemy encounters wont occur.[CR]The battle system revolves mainly around each characters Abilities, which are a set of commands specific to that character. Abilities require AP and EX to use. AP is gained every time a character takes a turn. The default is 2. EX is gained every time a character uses an Ability. The default is 1. Note that this may change depending on the situation.[CR]Trailer courtesy of Sum Gai. Thanks buddy![CR][B]"Controls"[/B] [CR]Z: Action/ Confirm[CR]	Up: Interact with Above/Background[CR]	Down: Interact with Below/Foreground[CR]X: Menu/ Cancel[CR]Shift: Hold to walk/run[CR]F4: Toggle Fullscreen[CR]F5: Toggle 2x Size[CR]F12: Reset to Title[CR][B]"Known Glitches"[/B] [CR]Due to the limited functionality of the RPG Maker 2003 engine, there are various glitches and bugs which are unfortunately unfeasible or impossible to fix:[CR]	- Sometimes during an action, the battle data of a character will be temporarily overwritten with another characters, causing them to not perform as expected for that round.[CR]	- In certain cases, player actions can be interrupted by the enemy or other characters actions. To minimize the occurance of this, wait for current actions to finish before selecting an action with another character.[CR]	- Using items and guarding doesnt trigger the code to check for enemy deaths. You need to actually use an ability, or let the enemies take a turn.[CR]	- Although not a bug, Active Mode should be changed to Passive Mode in the in-game menu to prevent enemies from acting while you are taking an action.[CR][B]"Hints and Tips for Boss Battles"[/B] [CR]- Dont expect to just be able to spam regular attacks until you can use your Exceed ability. You wont win an attrition war with the enemy party.[CR]- Always target the enemys weakness if you can. If you want, think of this as a Shin Megami Tensei game. :P[CR]- Make sure to keep your HP up. The vast majority of bosses have pretty powerful high EX costing abilities thatll wipe out your party if youre not expecting it.[CR]- That said, keep in mind, [B]the enemy is subject to the same rules as the party[/B]. In other words, theyre also gaining AP and EX, and they also need it to use their more hard-hitting abilities. So if you can prevent them from using them while still retaining the ability to use yours, youll be able to beat any boss.[CR]	- You can tell how much EX an enemys ability uses by looking at the name of the ability. Similar to your characters abilities, itll show up as the number of squares on the left side of the name.[CR]	- Of course, the above passes quickly so isnt that reliable of a method. As a general rule, you can expect that:[CR]		- Anything that uses an element other than Force likely costs at least 1 EX[CR]		- Anything that does multi-targetting likely costs at least 1 EX[CR]		- Anything that hits everyone hard probably costs 2 or more EX[CR]		- Anything that outright kills someone from full health, or makes you swear "Bullshit! That cant happen!" is likely an Exceed ability.[CR]			- Chances are itll also be very flashy.[CR]	- Obviously, theres going to be some exceptions, but for the most part, this can be followed.[CR]- [B]Dont ignore Field Effects[/B] either. Bosses dont, and the Field Effects they use generally stack things in their favor. Its not just about dealing as much damage as quickly as you can. A lot of times, its also about controlling the situation.[CR]- Modes, Field Effects, and Boost ailments all stack. If youre creative, you may be able to create a situation where you can pretty much negate everything the boss throws at you, while tossing out Exceed abilities every turn. Bosses wont stand a chance.[CR][B] MAP SAVE FREEZE [/B]: If youre changing things in this game in the editor and your save file freezes on the world map as a result, press F9, go to switch 112 and 113, and turn them both OFF. That should fix it.</plot>

		<plot>Alter A.I.L.A. Variant takes place in a modern world, 3 years after the events of Alter A.I.L.A. Genesis. 2 years ago, a great war came to a decisive conclusion thanks to the efforts of a small band of people. Peace should have followed, but there are those who would choose to continue fighting. This is the continuation of that story[CR]The battle system revolves mainly around each character's Abilities, which are a set of commands specific to that character. Abilities require AP and EX to use. AP is gained every time a character takes a turn. The default is 2. EX is gained every time a character uses an Ability. The default is 1. Note that this may change depending on the situation.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Deacon Batista[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B]Once there was a secret island called "Antiarctica", somewhere deep beyond the sea. Nobody knew about its existence and the children who lived there didn't even know that there was a huge world outside of their home.[CR]One day the evil pirate Captain Manfred found Antiarctica and tried to conquer it. Unfortunately for him the kids manage to kill him... they used his ship to leave the island forever and to explore the world! They soon recognized that they couldn't find their home anymore, so there was no going back to Antiarctica. And so its existence became a legend... a legend of the paradise itself, an unreachable one.[CR]Still a lot of people are trying to find it and there are a lot of rumours and maps about how to reach the island, but after all noone ever made it.[CR]Little Deacon and his friends are also sailing the ocean to find Antiarctica believing they are the descendants of the infamous children from the legend about the island.[CR]One day they are attacked by a mysterious pirate ghost/ghost pirate who kills nearly all of them and kidnaps Deacon female friend Tantra. Deacon awakes on an unknown island. Having no more ship or anything he wants to save Tantra and to make that ghost pay.[CR]Features[CR]- real time action battle system (including light sabre and laser gun)[CR]- selfmade menu [CR]- step sounds (optional) [CR]- you can sail the ocean! [CR]- some original music [CR]- party members follow on map [CR]- 3 dungeons + bosses [CR]- different minigames/challenges/side quests [CR]- blinking (woooo!) </plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Max McGee[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Backstage is a "classic" rm2k3 psychological horror adventure game made in one month, in the early spring of 2005, for the first ever Release Something. It is probably my best received game of all time, and I am very proud of it, especially because it was completed in such a short time![CR]"Hell isnt a place, but a state of mind. Hell lives within us all."[CR]	Tom Keller is lost. He has gone astray, and become trapped in a nightmare world that is a twisted mirror image of our own, tormented by horrific abberations, haunted by shattered memories. He is alone behind the world, and to escape, he must come to terms with all of his sins.[CR]CHARACTERS[CR]	Tom Keller is an average enough guy, although one badly down on his luck. On the evening this nightmare begins, hes coming home from a fancy dinner with his wife, at a nice restaurant- where she took him to tell him she was leaving him, and where he still picked up the check. Shes kicked him out of the house and had the locks changed, and hes had quite a bit to drink after dinner, and wants nothing more than to call her and give her the piece of his mind. Hes already checked into a seedy hotel down town, where he plans to sleep it off after making a phone call. However, he is about to step through to the other side of a mirror that will warp and destroy everything he thought he knew about his life.[CR]	Alice Sirafas is an enigmatic and intriguing dark haired woman, the polar opposite in appearance and attitude of Toms soon-to-be-ex wife Lucy. She seems to know Tom, although he cant remember from where, and she seems to have both a troubled past and a loose grip on reality. However, by the time Tom meets her, she may be his only ally against the shadows that lurk and wait Backstage.[CR]	Detective Aaron Wilks is a dedicated and honorable law man, one of the only clean cops in a department rife with corruption. When his partner is killed by a serial killer, and the case file is purposely misfiled, vaulted, and buried by the chief of police, Wilks sets out to find the truth, and get revenge, even though his superiors have specifically ordered him off the case. Putting his career and his life on the line, Detective Wilks tracks the killer to a hotel downtown.[CR]	Mask is a mysterious figure who Tom soon meets once he falls through the cracks of this world into the bloody shadows of the next. Although Mask appears to be human, he seems to have some kind of control over the horrifc creatures that stalk the darkness backstage. He explains that he is trying to help Tom, and educate him, but his methods of education seem more like torture as he stalks Tom through the twisted mirror world he cant seem to escape from.[CR]HINTS AND TIPS[CR]	Backstage is best played in near total darkness, with good quality speakers, or even better, headphones, with the volume turned up high. Not only will this enhance the atmosphere of the gameplay experience, and give the game a fair chance to scare the hell out of you, a dark background will make several of the games darker areas easier to see, and quality speakers or headphones will let you hear some of the subtler directional cues to the games audio puzzles.[CR]ENDINGS AND RANK[CR]	Backstage has 3 Endings that can be earned depending on your actions throughout the game, and a Rank System that is...broken. [CR]So...[CR]if you enjoyed Max McGees releases, especially Ruptured Souls...[CR]and if you like horror games in general,[CR]especially Silent Hill...[CR]and you havent played this yet,[CR]what are you waiting for?</plot>

		<title_clean>Backstage II Demo</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Game Status: Hiatus[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] *Backstage II is not an RPG but a psychological-horror adventure game. Most of the gameplay is exploration and/or solving simple puzzles to advance the story.[CR]*Combat in Backstage II is conducted through a Seamless Cinematic Combat System (SCCS) which is a fancy way to say that its mostly automatic. Combat starts if you collide with an enemy and is over in a few seconds without any input from you. [CR]There are NO HUDS, NUMBERS, OR HEALTH BARS ever displayed on the screen, which is why its seamless and cinematic. The game does not pause or its perspective change for combat. Combat resolves itself automatically largely based on what weapon you have equipped (if any) and a few other factors.[CR]*Improvements to the SCCS since Backstage:[CR]The combat system in Backstage II has been seriously overhauled since the original, given more bells and whistles and made more interactive. The players choices should now have a greater effect on success or failure in combat. The basic system is the came, but modifications include the following:[CR]+Weapons can now be equipped through the main menu. This way you can choose which weapons are used on which enemies, unlike in Backstage where players were all-to-often screwed out of ammo by the automatic prioritization of Guns before Defense Items. (No more will you waste a crucial bullet on a Nightgaunt and then wind up killed by a Clockwork because all you have is a Glass Shard.)[CR]+Defense Weapons have been added to the game. Defense weapons are like defense items, only infinitely reusable. (Unlike a glass shard, a combat knife wont break if you use it to defend yourself.) Defense weapons can only be used by The Prodigal whereas The Prophet still uses Defense Items much like in the original Backstage. To compensate for their infinite uses, Defense Weapons have less-than-perfect Accuracy. Each weapon has a base accuracy represented by a percent chance to hit. Different situational factors (more below) can effect a Defense weapons accuracy. Although generally preferable, Defense weapons are risky to use- poor acccuracy can result in multiple hits from one monster, although each successive swing increases your probability of hitting.[CR]+Running system has been added. Press SHIFT to toggle between walking and running. (Default is walking.) The main interactive element of combat in Backstage is still trying to avoid monsters to conserve ammunition. The ability to toggle between walking and running adds another level to this mechanic. While running, obviously, you will move faster, but receive a penalty to acccuracy with Defense Weapons. It will be easier to avoid monsters, but if you do run into one, you will have a greater chance of being damaged if youre equipped with a Defense Weapon. Running while unarmed or armed with a firearm has no disadvantages, save that firearms have limited ammo and while unarmed you will be automatically damaged.[CR]+Directional-Combat has been implemented. If you Attack a monster (collide with it instead of it colliding with you) head on you will receive a bonus to accuracy when using a Defense Weapon. If a monster catches you and hits your back or sides, you wont receive this bonus.[CR]+Major Cosmetic Improvement: 18 different fluid character poses, articulated character movement, and improved battle animations make combat in Backstage look MUCH more like combat. If you watch carefully and dont blink, for instance, you could see Raechel attempt to fire at an enemy with an unloaded pistol, have the gun click empty, be slashed by the enemy, and then pistol whip it with the empty gun to kill it. This is the major improvement from Backstage.[CR]And thats all you really need to know. Enjoy!</plot>

For that, they videotape their torture sessions and post it to online forums, to get other members appreciation and reviews.[CR]BE:D tells the story of Verge, a dungeoneer depressed because hes lost his touch with doing decent videos, and because the love of his life, Daily, couldnt care less about his existence.[CR][B]Gameplay[/B][CR]BE:D has two distinct gameplay aspects:[CR]--The first one is similar to a Dating Sim, in which you have to approach strangers on the street and seduce them to go home with you, mainly using dialog choices.[CR]--The second one is more like a puzzle, and it consists of setting up your dungeon to torture your victims. Your goal at this stage is making your victim leave the dungeon completely shattered psychologically and physically, but still alive. Thats what the Dungeoneers call a  Beautiful Escape , and its the ultimate goal of the torture sessions. You can also get them killed, get them too depressed to leave the dungeon, or even have them leave healthy enough, but your viewers wont appreciate your videos as much. Its all about the delicate balance between too much and not enough.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] elements are tempered with lots of dialogs and the resolution of Verges love story.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: UPRC[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR]What is Blackmoon Prophecy?[CR]A Final Fantasy fangame that I started long ago in 2003 that is meant to emulate the first six entries of the series (though I mostly focus on FF4 and FF5 for gameplay and mapping, and FF6 for battle aesthetics). Aside from just being a fangame, Blackmoon Prophecy is also a tribute to Final Fantasy in the sense that I'm trying to put together many of the things I loved about playing RPGs growing up into this game. It's a love letter to retro gaming and our childhoods. [CR]What's with this whole Plus deal?[CR]The Plus! update adds DynRPG support by including several patches made using it such as faster ATB bars, a play time counter on the menu, and more. Additional content in the game includes a new section to the arena, a new optional dungeon, a few reworked cutscenes, and various bug fixes. [CR]How long is the game? [CR]My best guess is about twenty hours, but I'm not 100% sure. My testing sessions were broken up very often so I can't measure how long it took me to beat the game personally. I'm certain that it was over 15 hours though, and since I made the game I expect the average time to be higher than that for everyone else. My best guess is 20+ hours.</plot>

		<title_clean>Blue Memories</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: JuneFlowa[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Blue Memories is the result of my experimentations with RPG Maker 2003 during this summer of 2017. It is an exploration/ item finding game, basically a similar type of progression as a metroidvania, except it has the gameplay of a classic top down rpg maker game.[CR]In Blue Memories, you assume the role of The Runaway, a mysterious character that keeps his name secret and seems to be running from an unknow threat. His tribulations eventually leads him to hide in an abandoned elementary school (the setting of the game) for a night. Safe inside the school, he will try to make his way into the deeper rooms of the building and uncover its past by reading various notes and posters, as well as access its locked and forgotten rooms.[CR]The main focus of the story is its environment: an abandonned school that used to be the meeting place for an amateur occult club. Notes, posters and environmental storytelling will help you uncover what happened to the club and its members as the main character tries to make his way deeper into the building. The game features very few dialogues and characters, as most of the time The Runaway explores the building alone. The story, however, isnt the main focus of the game, as aesthetic and ambiance are what I mostly wanted to create the game on.[CR]The game is only made in 4 colors, black, a dark blue and 2 shades of light blue! This is an aesthetic I wanted to try out, and Im pleased with how it ended up.I also made the music myself, and its (hopefully) nice.[CR]This is not a horror game! Even though it is about exploring an abandonned place, its not meant to scare you. There are a few "spooky" things, but its mostly for ambiance.[CR]Is about half an hour long, but the bonus content adds a bit more. There are also a few optional diarie entries and posters that you can read around the school.[CR]Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy this game!</plot>

The locals interpret his sudden appearance as proof of an ancient prophecy and recruit our obtuse hero to protect the kingdom from evil forces. Seasoned, no-nonsense adventurer Duane is assigned to be his guide. Can C.J. help the real heroes fight off the kingdoms enemies? Or is he just completely useless? [CR]Featuring:[CR]-Weird bro-centric skills to confuse and annoy enemies![CR]-No random encounters![CR]-Awesome art by Makio-Kuta![CR]-Come on now. I only had 5 days to do this, theres no ATB system or anything crazy like that.[CR]If youve got about a half-hour or so, I hope [B]Bro Quest[/B] brings you some laughs and fun!</plot>

Striker, Balance or Passive. Striker types regain MP in battle by attacking only. Theyll gain 20 MP this way, and are usually more for saving up for a big attack.[CR]Balance types regain 10 MP regardless of what command is used. Their skills tend to cost less but are not usually focused on having a big final attack to use.[CR]Passive types regain 30 MP when you defend. They also start with the most MP in a battle and are Mage-types.[CR]*Encounter Gauge which fills up as you fight encounters (which are seen on the map). Once filled, you can open up a special chest in the area.[CR]*Party changing system</plot>

Can Chii find a way out?[CR]Chii's Challenge was created for the Retromania event held in honour of RMN's 10th Birthday. It's my first fully custom (graphically) game and is both quite short and quite simple. I might come back and add more to it at a later date but for now, it's complete. Please keep in mind that despite the name, it's only very lightly inspired by Chip's Challenge - basically what I recall of the game.[CR]Total gameplay is about 5-10 minutes (maybe a little longer).</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Avee[CR]Game Status: Production[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] "Out of all the fanmade remakes or sequels to the NES game Crystalis out there, this is the only one thats actually happening."[CR] Presentation [CR]Crystalis was one of my first and favorite games on the NES back in the early 1990s. I decided to make it an RpgMaker project, rewriting many parts of the story while preserving the main storyline, dungeons, events and gameplay. So it could be considered as an oldschool game and fan-made remake of the original game.[CR]Please note that this project is a  remake , not a copy. It is to the original Crystalis what Oath in Felghana is to Wanderers from Ys: new story, new art style, new gameplay, etc.[CR] Background storyline [CR][B]1987[/B]: Scientists working under the Velyagun Empire accidentally create thermonuclear weapons. The Empire plans to develop and use these weapons to wage war against the great countries of the continent, all fighting for technological superiority.[CR][B]1997[/B]: Tension climaxes between the most powerful countries and over half of the civilized world is ravaged by thermonuclear war thus resulting in the Earths axis shift. The surviving groups of soldiers and scientists struggle savagely for domination. Experiments are run by mad scientists on various animals to create armies of mutants. And yet the population tries to rebuild villages and live as best they can.[CR][B]2007[/B]: A young woman, Misae, alchemist Xevus pupil, manages to create the first weapon that can rival with post-apocalyptic weaponry: an elemental sword that draws on the magical powers of the spirits. Under the guidance of her master, shell travel to the four corners of the continent to gather the powers of the other spirits and fight the evil Empire.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]-Similar to the original game (itself similar to The Legend of Zelda and the Ys series). You move in 4 directions with the arrow keys and use three other keys to attack, charge your swords power level, cast spells and bring up the subscreen.[CR]-Action RPG gameplay lets you and your opponents attack at close range or at a distance with various spells and magic attacks.[CR]-You can level up, buy and equip armors and accessories, use various items in the subscreen, find key items to reach new areas and find new spells and new swords throughout the game.[CR]-The game relies mostly on the fun of exploiting your swords power levels attacks and solving puzzles inside dungeons. Most enemies also have specific elemental weaknesses you can take advantage of.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Leric[CR]Game Status: Production[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]Introduction[/B] [CR]Cyber Factor is a Rm2k3 game that Ive been making off and on since 2003-2004. It started as a Rm2k project, then became a Rm2k3 project and then a RMXP project (which is mainly where most of last years development went) and now has returned to Rm2k3. This demo contains 2-4 more hours (maybe more idk) of gameplay which covered the entire 1st area and its related story arc.[CR]NOTE: If you still have your save from the previous demo DO NOT USE IT WITH THIS VERSION since Ive redone the way you gain Tech Arts (You use to gain one of 3 Tech Arts when you reacted Rank (Lv.) 5 but now you gain them when your Body, Mind or Soul reach a certain levels meaning now youll eventually have all 3 of them) and done alot of other changes that might break the game if you use the old save files. For the record in future demos you should be able to use Save files from this demo since I dont plan to make any more major changes.[CR][B]What is Cyber Factor?[/B] [CR]A semi-nonlinear RPG (think like Legend of Mana) based on a theory I had after stupidly watching the Matrix and Lawnmower Man on the same day (something I suggest you never do). I thought about how quickly AI has improved in videogames from when they were first created. Now imagine in say 100 years from now the AI in games will probably be so advanced that the games characters will probably believe themselves to be alive and they will be after all when you think about it arent we just an advanced code ourselves? Well what if this is all just a code written by beings more advanced than us? Many religions state that a god created everything well what if the method used by this god is the same method that we will use in 100 years to create a game world? Cyber Factor is a Rm2k3 RPG based around this theory. [CR][B]So Whats the Story?[/B] [CR]This is sorta hard to explain in a game such as this but basically Cyber Factor happens in a world very much like our own only people are well aware of there datalogically coded make-up. The world itself has nearly been completely deleted by Viral creatures known as Geist. You play a guy named Heiro, created from Life Data that fell from the sky and its your job to restore the world. There is no basic "this guys evil go kick his ass plotline" to tell since through the course of the game many events happen each leading to a conclusion so I spose a summary of the story would go something like "You play Heiro and it is your job to restore the world while fighting against the Geist cause".[CR][B]You Restore the World? How Exactly Do You Do That?[/B] [CR]After completing events you gain what is called World Data and by using said data at restore points on the map you can restore anything from a single town, to a mountain range, to a continent. You then venture into these newly created areas completing new events and gaining more World Data. You can also change the areas themselves such as adding in a bridge or blocking off a lake to stop the water flow by finding and using Extra Data at reorganization points. [CR][B]Game Features[/B] [CR]-Restore the world using a system inspired by the Soul Blazer series and Legend of Mana. [CR]-Enemies are see-able on the field and chase you similar to Grandia. [CR]-Customized DBS with a heavier emphasis on the tactical use of arts. [CR]-Combi system allows you to use powerful combinations of the arts youve obtained. [CR]-Read various pages of books on shelves. [CR]-Unique upgrading system allocate skill points into the catagories Body, Mind and Soul to upgrade your stats and learn new Arts as you level up. [CR]-Battlechars with more than 3 frames per animation. [CR]-Battle voices. (heyas and such) [CR]-Various optional mini-games. (This will be the next thing I work on) [CR]-Fight in an arena for money and items (Not in this demo, this is in area 2). [CR]-Create and customize a robot mech in the in-game video game "Mobile Gear" and battle against the mechs of NPCs across the world. (One of the next things Ill work on, I consider it a mini-game, just a larger one)[CR]-New Game +, play the game over with your ending stats and Arts as well as a few special items allowing you to discover new secrets within the game. (Obviously not in this demo or any demo following this one since it will only work when the game is finished) [CR]-6 endings as well as 2 extra endings obtainable after New Game +. (Maybe I should remove these 2 from the features till the game is done?) [CR]-Use alchemy to combine Extra Equipment to make new ones.[CR]-Not really a feature but you can now see which Tech Arts Elemental Arts can make Combis with in the description of the Elemental Arts Exe Installer. Please keep in mind that some Elemental Arts also make new Combis with other Elemental Arts, theses arent in the desrciptions.[CR][B]Characters[/B] [CR]Heiro [CR]Age: Born when the game begins but his humanoid form appears as a 15 to 17 year old.[CR]Weapon: Soliton (Sword)[CR]Heiro was created from the Life Data that fell from the sky, has the ability to transfer and move the worlds data at will. Thats really all there is to know about him as you will decide his personality by how you play the game and what you say to other characters. [CR]Zoei Fritzgard [CR]Age: 18 [CR]Weapon: Z Armor (Martial Arts)[CR]Zoei is the daughter of Cirel Fritzgard a famous Professor of Datology (the science of data and coding of it) and the creator of the Heavens Edge Airship. After the fall of Helmsberg 12 years ago Zoei was taken in by Heavens Edge and is now on her way to one day becoming an Einlanzer (Einlanzer: A military force based on Heavens Edge who are trained to fight Geist). [CR]Kayne Alexander [CR]Age: 35 [CR]Weapon: Varii Gun (A gun that can shoot any know type of bullet)[CR]Kayne is a monk of the Shrine of Onnu and son of the famous monk Azriel Alexander and Fheyana a mysterois woman found by his father near the Shrine of Onnu one day. It is said that he is the one who discovered the book which contains the Lux Legend but if this is true or not is unknown. [CR]Serafin Alexander [CR]Age: 42 [CR]Weapon: Gaian (Book)[CR]Serafin is Kaynes older brother. Hes gained fame as a warrior monk who travels the world destroying Geist with his followers. Some people look to him as the worlds only hope.[CR]Jack Banner [CR]Age: 32 [CR]Weapon: Brawlingtons (Gauntlets)[CR]An Einlanzer, Jack was a close friend of Cirel Fritzgard. During the fall of Helmsberg it was Jack who saved Zoei and brought her to Heavens Edge. [CR]Saceli Irving [CR]Age: 36 [CR]Weapon: Excalia (Sword)[CR]Saceli is a member of the Irving family of knights who have long served the Mano royal family. She was a childhood friend of Mari Fritzgard, Zoeis mother. After the Mano-Mona Kingdoms deletion Saceli joined Heavens Edge mainly as a teacher but she also takes part in some missions. [CR]Caprine Callenco [CR]Age: 18 [CR]Weapon: Nothing (Attacks like your little sister)[CR]Caprine is the daughter of the notorious mobster team of Sal Callenco and Rachelle Karris. Caprine joined the Junior Einlanzers around the same time as Zoei and they quickly became bestfriends and have even rented an apartment on the Eastside of Heavens Edge together...well actually she pays like 95% of the rent but...well they live there together. [CR]NOTE: There are some more characters who join you during certain events Legend of Mana style. The one you need to know from this demo is...[CR]Wendolyn DMarco (Wendy)[CR]Age: 10[CR]Weapon: Change Purse (Yeah really, an old ladys change purse)[CR]A pirate captain from an unknown land. Claims to be from an orphanage somewhere but her true origins and how she became a captain over pirates at such a young age are a mystery.[CR][B] Things You Need to Know Before Playing the Demo [/B][CR]Enemy Weaknesses: The icons beside the Geist name arent there elemental properties its there weaknesses. As will be explained later (you play Zoei during a class) unlike most RPGs enemies in Cyber Factor dont have certain elements but they are weak to certain types of attacks. For example a Ruby Dragon just because all its attacks are Fire based doesnt mean its weak to Water. Its "fire pit" is inside its belly but the mighty horn on its head is a direct line to its nervous system, this means that its actually weak to Lightning. So you see weaknesses arent based on a "this counters this" system but on more realistic terms thus Id be crazy if I expected you to just look at an enemy and figure out what its weak to. Every enemy has atleast 1 Tech weakness and Elemental weakness and exploiting these weaknesses is key to battle superiority. [CR]Combi Arts: As you perform Normal Attacks and Arts youll notice that the Trianglar Meters next to the characters name will fill (they fill more when you use Arts). When atleast 1 of these meters is filled you can then perform a Combi Art. Combi Arts usually do not use Energy (MP). [CR]Saving: You can save anywhere so dont go around looking for a save point cause there arent any.</plot>

[CR]They can may make you feel scared, anxious, or upset, but nightmares cant harm you. [CR]Or can they? [CR] There was once a greedy emperor who possessed a great legion of demons. He desired complete control over every aspect of men in his empire, even control over their dreams. [CR]An old merchant, who was rumored to have once been a great adventurer, presented the emperor with a powerful turtle demon that had the ability to manipulate the dreams of men. [CR]The emperor immediately decided he wanted it and commanded the merchant to give him the demon. The merchant refused but offered it to the king on the condition that he defeat the demon in battle to prove he was worthy. [CR]The king was outraged at the merchants arrogance and ordered his guards to seize him and capture the demon. The merchant quickly explained that the demon only obeyed those who defeated it in battle. [CR]The king then hatched a cunning plan, he would call his bravest, most loyal soldier to defeat the demon. So the soldier was brought forth to face the mighty demon. [CR]The creature did not use its claws in combat, but its power over the mind, and sucked the soldier into a dangerous dream land where he would be forced to fight not the demon owned by the merchant, but the demons inside his own head ~Beanius Maximus</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: AznChipmunk[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]Note: I DID NOT MAKE THIS. It is a translated project from German.[/B] [CR]It was originally created by Kelven. I had his permission to translate it. Even though I did not make it, I put a lot of working into completely translating this, including having to redo many picture graphics, many messages, etc.[CR]Story: Taking place somewhere in California, the game follows Sandra Richmont, who was traveling with her parents to visit their uncle. After an argument and a bathroom stop, her parents appear to have driven off without her. Thinking that her parents plan to stay overnight in the nearest city, Dusty Creek, Sandra heads towards there. However, after meeting two others who are stranded, she realizes that they are trapped and the city has some dark secrets...[CR]The gameplay consists of solving puzzles, adventure game style. If you need a walkthrough, theres one included in the game folder. However, its in German, so you can try to babelfish it or something.[CR][B]WARNING: When you are poisoned in the mines, do not begin the cart pushing puzzle until you have found the antidote. Otherwise you cant get it later and cant beat the game (if you save.)[/B] I actually could have fixed this bug, but it was in the original and I wanted to leave all of the coding 100% intact.[CR]Everything has been translated, from dialogue to pictures.[CR]The game utilizes 99% custom graphics created by Kelven, who took the effort to make nearly everything examinable, all drawers/cabinets openable and examinable, and has pumped out probably 20 or so games. (Which all have mostly custom graphics I think.)</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Rose_Guardian[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Story:[CR]Princess Annabelle was having a typical day at the beach, collecting crabs for supper. While doing so, she sees a man lying unconscious by the waters edge. She immediately takes him back to the castle, and tends to him until his consciousness returns. When he does, he shows classic signs of amnesia: No knowledge of who he is, and memories are difficult to surface. [CR]Annabelle calls him "Edge" (after how she found him), and believes a walk in a nearby woods would benefit him greatly. While the walk does do him good, they run across a mysterious person that seems to want Edge dead. During this confrontation, Annabelle sees how Edge fights, and connections to certain legends start formulating in her head. To her, Edge may be the Chosen One, fated to defeat an unspeakable evil. If its true, will he actually be able to? [CR]Personal Note:[CR]This game is a submission to the Golden Age of Game Making, using (or subverting) cliches, developed in the space of about a week, and made with the RPG Maker 2000 (or RPG Maker 2000) engine.

		<title_clean>Deus Cards</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: watermark[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] With the reboot of RPG Maker 2003 on Steam, I thought Id dust up an old favorite of mine made a decade ago in my youth, Deus Cards. This game was originally made with RM2K and wont run on most systems nowadays. I think some people might still find this enjoyable so I upgraded it using the new RM2K3. I updated some graphics, music, code, and dialogue, but this is mostly the original game.[CR]This is a CCG (as in Collectible Card Game) and RPG hybrid. You collect robots known as Avatars as well as cards used to control them to compete in a worldwide card tournament. This game was originally inspired by the anime Angelic Layer by CLAMP. Its an anime about a girl playing a battle game using mini robots on a machine called the Layer. A popular game that shares similar concepts is Capcoms Megaman Battle Network.[CR]Looking back, this game has some gameplay issues and display limitations. Some things could be done better, but the core concept is sound. So this is definitely a game that I am thinking of completely remaking when MV comes out. It will have more options such as custom player creation, avatar modifications, and the story of Gus and Jacob will be completed. Also the AI and display will be much improved due to the more powerful scripting engine that will be available.[CR]Still, imho this version is still quite fun and is a complete game that you can beat. :D[CR][B]STORY[/B] [CR]In the near future, two scientists Sidney Terrail and Kalman Svabo invents the psi-conductor, a material that allows people to operate computer systems by thought. With bankruptcy threatening their company, they made a psi-circuit laced card game combined with mini robots called Deus Cards, hoping it would tide them over till more "serious" business appears. To their surprise, the game is a hit and soon evolves into a worldwide phenomenon with competitions rivaling that of the Olympics.[CR]Its now 5 years later. A twist of fate introduces newbie player Gus Hunter and his best friend Jacob ONeal onto the world stage of Deus Cards. Thus begins a tale of friendship, adventure, and awesome card battles![CR][B]FEATURES[/B] [CR]  A unique action collectible card game!  [CR]  More than 80 cards to collect and infinite combos!  [CR]  10 unique Deus players and 20 unique Avatars.  [CR]  Multi-tiered tournament system.  [CR]  Follow the story of Gus and Jacob as they begin their card journey!  [CR][CR]Enjoy!</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Erilex[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] One of the most critically acclaimed *  Spanish RPG maker games now fully translated into English by Erilex (me), original creator of the game.[CR]Dhuxs Scar follows the misadventures of Elijah, a lowly, mediocre merchant that is suddenly faced with the chance of a lifetime: To earn a huge fortune by betraying the trust of one innocent little girl. Of course, things wont work out quite as smoothly as he intended. Little does he know that he is about to be dragged into a ruthless battle between powers that defy human comprehension. There will be blood. And tears. Not to mention painfully generic (yet entertaining in a trainwreck sort of way) plot twists.[CR]The game contains plenty of the following:[CR]-Custom graphics. Lots of them. Chipsets and panoramas are pretty much the only thing that isnt 100% custom (with a few exceptions towards the end of the game)[CR]- Insanely difficult  Challenging gameplay and battles.[CR]-Two different endings.[CR]-Pixelated blood and violence.[CR]-Not so pixelated but still rather crudely drawn blood and violence.[CR]-Religious overtones! Yay! [CR]===[B] IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE PLAYING :[/B]===[CR]Dhuxs Scar was created with the [B]1.51 Value![/B] version of RPG Maker 2000, which adds some extra features such as increasing the maximum number of pictures being shown on screen, or allowing enemies to have up to 99999 HP. Using an older version of the editor to modify the game or play in test mode might have unexpected (and probably game-breaking) results. The safest thing to do is to play it directly from the executable. [CR]=======================================[CR] *  Whether this means that Spanish people have really low standards or that the game is actually any good will be left to the players discretion.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Dreaded[CR]Game Status: Cancelled[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] A re-release of my classic RM2k/2k3 hit Diary of a Madman. For those of you who have forgotten, in DoaM you travel the land as Ganthithor, a necromancer whom is a victim of unfortunate circumstances. Through his journey, you will meet allies and foes alike, and unveal Ganthithors past and how he came to be what he is, as well as what the future holds for him. The game features many innovative (or at least at the time of original release) abilities as well as being one of the few games of its kind. This release which is coming soon fixes many of the bugs that appeared in the release that is currently available, as well as expands the gameplay to the end of the first chapter. There are also some grammatical errors that have been fixed, as well as graphical improvements especially in animation. [CR][B]Please contact if you have an interest in beta-testing when the time comes.[/B]</plot>

The self-proclaimed lord of demon-kind has been slain, and the world restored back to a state of order. Even the four Great Relics could not completely destroy the power of the Demon Lord however.

		<title_clean>Dragon Destiny</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker VX Ace[CR]Author: sjmorgan[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]PLOT[/B][CR]Destiny of the Dragon Lord is the alternate story of the Dragon Lord, primary antagonist of Dragon Quest 1. His goal is to conquer the land of Alefgard, which houses the kingdom of Tantagel and several villages. This game features monster armies marching from Charlock Castle (Dragon Lords keep) to every point of the land in order to enforce the Dragon Lords rule. Rebel monsters and humans both separately oppose the Dragon Lords wishes for absolute rule. His adviser Daat tries to guide the impulsive, but powerful Dragon Lord and help make his dreams come true. Servants and new recruits through out the game add to the roster of generals that lead the Dragon Lords armies.[CR][B]WHERE IT STARTED[/B][CR]Destiny of the Dragon Lord started as a concept while I was helping a new dev develop basic systems for a Dragon Quest 1 remake. I tried to talk him out of it because its been done so many times, but he was adamant. I had just commissioned a Destiny of an Emperor (think JPRG NES Dysasty Warriors) battle and menu system script from LeCode with plans to make a Destiny of an Emperor Starter Pack. That evening, I told the new dev that I was going to make my own game putting a twist on this notion of remaking Dragon Quest 1. I am making a DQ1 game where the Dragon Lord is the main character and his quest is to conquer all of Alefgard. (I want to release a total of 3 DQ themed games since we dont get enough of them in the West, then forever shift away from making them.)[CR][B]FEATURES[/B][CR]+ This game features Destiny of an Emperor styled combat and menus inspired by DoaE.[CR]+ This game features sprites from GBC Dragon Quest 1 and 2 that have had edits as well as custom sprites.[CR]+ This game features a shared pool of Tactic Points that fuel Tactics. They function like spells for the armies use, with the Tactic list derived from the list of abilities the curent acting strategist has. The player appoints the strategist out of combat at will and they have various lists of abilities.[CR]+ This game has a purchasable and winnable resource called food. Each step your party takes on the world map depletes it as you are armies marching to do battle.[CR]+ Like DoaE, reaching new mile stones in the games development will cause the in battle HP (Troop) gauges to change a new color and have a new min/max display range.[CR]+ Like DoaE, portraits of important characters will have backgrounds rather than solid single colors behind them.[CR]+ Like DoaE, most recruits have preset HP (Troops,) but main characters gain HP (Troops) per level.[CR]+ Like DoaE, exp is stored for Party Level only, and party members are automatically the Party Level at any given time. Level ups are for Main Character HP (Troops,) Shared TP Gains and access to new Tactics.</plot>

		<title_clean>Dreamscape</title_clean>
		<clearlogo1>oAzY8B3.jpg</clearlogo1>
		<plot>Entering people's dreams and subconscious thoughts has always been an intriguing concept in storytelling. It has been used in comedy (as in the "Sleepy Time" episode of Spongebob Squarepants), horror (as in the Nightmare on Elm Street films), and in a whole host of other genres in movies, books, and television. Plenty of RPGs utilize this theme as well, including Alundra, Revelations: Persona, and Whisper of a Rose. And Aldorlea Games has now tossed its hat into the thematic ring with Dreamscape.[CR]Dreamscape was created by the same team who does Aldorlea's episodic Millennium series. There are some characteristic vibes indicative of this team and a few nods to other Aldorlea games, such as Marine's cameo as the tutorial teacher, but the game remains distinct, even among its RPG Maker brethren. Overall, Dreamscape is not as conventional an RPG as it appears to be, and at the end of the day, that unconventionality makes it a breath of fresh air.[CR]The story starts with the protagonist, Erin, answering an excited call from her boyfriend Terry, who wants to show her something amazing. Erin goes to Terry's house, where he proudly shows her a magical set of headphones that supposedly allow the wearer to explore other peoples' dreams and imaginations. Terry tries them out on a reluctant Erin only to have them both wind up in Lostham, a dreamland limbo, where he disappears. Erin soon gets her hands on these headphones, finds Terry's cat Athena (who can now talk), and the two venture off into various dreams in search of Terry and hopefully a straight answer to the simple question, "What the heck is going on here?" As Erin meets playable and non playable characters within the dream worlds, she can use the headphones to explore these characters' dreams and the dreams of other characters within their dreams, getting a sense of who they are and maybe some answers about Terry's whereabouts in the process.[CR]The premise is a bit flimsy, but no more so than your average Japanese-style RPG. Dreamscape is not a bombastic RPG with a labyrinthine plot of mass confusion, but rather the simple story of a girl trying to find her lost boyfriend in the cumulative world of peoples' dreams. In doing so, she satisfies the curiosity of discovering what the strange people and animals she meets along the way are dreaming of. The story is less about events and dialogue and more about atmosphere. It's show rather than tell, in that players get a sense of the playable and non-playable characters by experiencing their dreams rather than by reading tons of exposition-filled text. There were lots of really cool dreams, such as a side-scrolling version of prohibition-era New York City, a genuinely creepy nighttime London with Jack the Ripper on the loose, and all manner of fantasy dreams. These dreams gave me a sense of the attached character more than mere text could. That being said, the text did have plenty of cute chuckles from the funky characters.</plot>

		<plot>This… isn’t even a game! It’s a movie of sorts. The story follows an operative battling the corporations and conspiracies that follow him. Lots of twists and turns. Takes place in a cyberpunk future where robots and hacking are the centerpiece. Very Ghost in the Shell, It does actually have an ending but hints at a possible game based off of this. Overall I really enjoyed the effective cutscene direction and planning. There’s a lot of well done parts.</plot>

		<plot>From the game's manual, The Duchess of the fair land of Elstwhere comes by carriage to the Marque of Wulfhammer, presumably to marry its lord, Embric of Wulfhammer. Embric, however, is nowhere to be found. The Duchess, not being the sort to sit around idly, embarks on her own quest to get to know the body of the eccentric populace of Castle Wulfhammer, among them the ladies and dwarves of the Awesome Fellowship, those rescued on the Fellowship's grand adventures, a bevy of mysterious townsfolk, monsters, nobles, demons, and devils, waitresses, clerks, clerics, and more.[CR]But there is something strange about this castle and its people. As the mysteries begin to unravel, and the real lives and futures of the people of Wulfhammer come into question, who can rescue those who are so used to doing the rescuing?[CR]Primarily a comedic and heavily Yuri/Shoujo Ai story, the object of the game is not to fight monsters with a band of heroes to save the world from some cataclysm, but to explore the stories of the people of Castle Wulfhammer. There is almost no traditional combat and the game is packed with scenes and endings, and lots and lots of characters.</plot>

Using any combination of thirteen other adventurers that he sees fit to accompany him, Zack must retrieve the lost treasure without meeting the same dark end as those who have gone seeking it before him. What he doesnt know is that the evil protecting this treasure is far more devious than he and his sellsword friend imagine![CR][B]...::: Gameplay, Features and Comments :::...[/B] [CR] Engalia: The Wager  is a short RPG originally made in only a week as part of the [B] RM Venture [/B] event, before being patched up slightly after the contest was over. The total development time was approximately 2-3 weeks. It features a traditional active-time battle system, a handful of (hopefully) intelligent puzzle sequences, and some (what I think are) beautifully designed dungeons... or as many of these things as I could make in such a short time!</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: ForgottenDawn[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]_fade[/B] is a puzzle-adventure game focused on the exploration of a surreal inner world, featuring three vast areas concealing untold secrets and mysteries. The main playable character, a shadow with no identity, must journey through these scenarios and find out what lies deep within.[CR]This experience is envisioned as the first of a greater story arc, following the evolution of this entity from a featureless shadow to a more complex, ascended being. The players task would be to guide this creature throughout his fragmented inner world and solve various puzzles to "reconstruct" the oneiric dimension. Since the experience is meant to be atmospheric other than a symbolic introduction to the story arc, there is  no real plot  other than what the player experiences through their interactions.[CR]What the experience currently has:[CR]- Three major explorable areas featuring various surreal thematically linked sub-sections[CR]- Immersing soundscapes and ambiances to enrich the game atmosphere[CR]- Custom pixel art graphics reminiscent of the 16-bit era[CR]- An ever-changing world depending on player choices[CR][B]_fade complete soundtrack[/B] available here:  https://forgottendawn-vgm.bandcamp.com/album/fade-prototype-complete-ost [CR]Development cycle: 2014/16[CR]***[CR][B]Quick FAQ[/B][CR][B]Q: Is this a finished game?[/B][CR]A: You may consider this as a finished prototype, meaning its only a part of the idea behind it.[CR][B]Q: Wait, how long has this game been here?[/B][CR]A: Its been effectively in the works since 2014. Ive stopped developing it at some point around 2016, even though I kept writing new ideas for the concept.[CR][B]Q: Why have you stopped developing it?[/B][CR]A: I had and still have other projects in mind. Im giving priority to smaller concepts mostly due to time constraints. Since _fade is still an important project for me, I thought it would be best to save this project for the future and rework it from scratch.[CR][B]Q: Will this game be remade on another engine?[/B][CR]A: Most likely, yes. Probably RPG Maker MV or even Unity, depending on how things will go in the future.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Vanit[CR]Game Status: Hiatus[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Hey guys, finally submitting a page here so my game is more accessible. TLDR: project is largely on hiatus, but I do plan to finish the bombing mission.[CR]A little about me:[CR]I graduated from a Bachelor of Engineering majoring in Software Engineering (2011), and Im currently working as a developer for a startup (web, Android, iOS).[CR]When I started my degree I decided to experiment on a high level with the programming concepts I was learning in something I was familiar with:  RPG Maker 2003. Over the years Ive seen many people attempt a 2D remake of FF7 and fail, so I thought Id try do it right.[CR]About the remake:[CR]My core goal is to make the FF7 that wouldve existed if it was developed in 2D instead of 3D. We were so close to living in this reality, so I find it an intriguing idea that Im almost writing this love letter of a game from an alternate dimension. To that end Im really fortunate that FF7 was designed, albeit unintentionally, in such a way that its very easy to relate back to 2D.[CR]The game itself is made in RPG Maker 2003 (rm2k3), however the only built-in feature Im really using is the tiled movement for the field. All the other systems (menu, combat, message boxes/text, etc) were built from scratch using rm2k3s event scripting. As a game engine rm2k3 is extremely restrictive so Im using quite a few hacks to make it more bearable (special thanks to Cherry, who is well known for his RPG Maker hacks).[CR]The bulk of the time spent developing the remake has been reproducing the menu and battle system in excruciating detail, which was my starting point before I even touched the art assets. 95% of the game mechanics are well documented, thanks to qhimm.com, such that my remake also plays exactly like the original as well as looking like it (this is why I say remake instead of demake). Even though my remake only has a few scenes, the menu and battle system are functionally able to handle all the mechanics in the game (I even use the exact same enemy AI). What isnt well documented is the behaviour of the interfaces, which Ive spent a lot of time studying to make sure mine are 99% accurate.[CR]Another part of replicating FF7s feel was in getting the art style right. If you look at the pre-rendered backgrounds in FF7 they really do look like crap - you can tell the artists didnt know how downsampled the renders would be in the final product, so theres a lot of blurry things-that-you-arent-quite-sure-what-they-are everywhere using way too many colours. I translated this feeling to my sprites by using really rough dithering that gives it that same shitty feeling that is very FF7. I also use the exact same colour palette, such that if you reverse image search screenshots of my remake, it will return results of the original game. To make sure Clouds battle animations felt the same I recreated them frame by frame in 2D (not rotoscoped).[CR]Im probably the only person whos glad the PC version of FF7 used midis because I was able to dump them, add flags so they loop properly and use them in rm2k3. Similarly I was able to dump all the sound effects as well (sadly theres over 700 of them and they have no file names - thats been fun). My remake wouldnt feel nearly as authentic without these, so a special thanks really has to go to the folks at qhimm.com who have done fantastic job reverse engineering FF7.[CR]Where I am now:[CR]The real FF7 has over 700 scenes, and the process for replicating each one takes me at least a week (I dont use tiled graphics - each background is drawn by hand, pixel for pixel) - you just need simple math to work out how long it would take me, and this is ignoring the additional time needed for character and enemy sprites. My personal goals have already been satisfied though - I gained experience designing/implementing complex game mechanics, and I answered my question of if you can really make a 2D game feel like its 3D counterpart (hint: its yes!). I still want to finish the bombing mission to make a complete package of "what it mightve been like", but my progress on this is glacial - the work left on this is Barrets battle animations, a few enemy sprites and about 7 more scenes.[CR]What I didnt account for when I started the project was my own personal development, and Ive moved beyond it being time well spent working on this project. Im a full blown software engineer now and Im capable of much more than a remake in rm2k3. I used to have insane amounts of free time, but now am married and work full time so Im very particular with what gets to occupy the remainder of my time. I want to start developing my own games that I have the rights/ability to release on Steam or Android/iOS, so my remake is on hiatus, although I do return for it from time to time when the motivation strikes.[CR]Intro demo (Midgar opening is still WIP)[CR]Battle demonstration</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: bleet[CR]Game Status: Production[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Fleshchild is a semi-episodic exploration/adventure game, similar to and inspired by Yume Nikki. You follow a baby eldritch abomination-type entity named Vis as it "grows up" at the behest of its parent, a giant red eyeball who lives in a sewer. The game has two main segments: Reality, and Dreaming.[CR] Reality:  Vis explores sections of Ashvale city to find whatever body parts its parent requests for the night. Gameplay in reality involves exploration, item collection, solving simple puzzles, and maybe killing people for body parts. Vis can get advice from its fellows in the sewer, alongside [B]Visybil[/B], who can provide more information on the objective and plot.[CR] Dreaming:  Vis explores their dreams as they sleep during the day. Gameplay in dreams involves exploration and item collection, and later on will include puzzles. [B]The dreams end abruptly and without warning[/B], so thoroughly exploring one THEMED location (such as the entirety of a hospital) before moving to the next will reward Vis with the best experience each dream has to offer.[CR][B]Background:[/B][CR]Vis is only one of many, but they may be the first. They are awoken from their sleep by their parent, a being so immense, only its single eye can be comprehended when gazed upon. Its time for Vis to grow up.[CR]However, in order to grow, Vis will need to borrow a few parts from the lovely people living upstairs. The game begins with Viss first emergence in the cover of night. Now that they are free to wander outside the sewer, they must hunt down all the parts they need to make themselves a proper adult. Unfortunately, people wont like lending Vis a hand if it costs an arm and a leg to do it![CR][B] WARNINGS: [CR]This game features copious amounts of visual violence, gore, blood, body horror, and a host of other things. Be wary of playing if you are sensitive to any of the above.[/B][CR][B] This is not a true horror game so dont expect jumpscares. You should not be scared while playing this game. [/B][CR][B]Play This Game If You Like:[/B][CR]  100% original graphics  [CR]  Lovecraftian stuff  [CR]  Cute stuff  [CR]  Games about horror that arent actually horror  [CR]  Awesome ambient soundtrack (provided by my lovely partner in crime,  Nitrosparxx )  [CR]  A choice in protagonists (there are only 2 but thats more than 1)  [CR]  All things gorey, boddyhorror-y, and much more  [CR]</plot>

A guide leads them through a common dream designed to shed any darkness carried over from their old world.

It is one of my official RM projects and consists of eight full episodes in all. [CR]This game features hilarious anime portraits, 2D environments, and some really funny characters and plot twists. The complete game is now finished and work has begun on the sequel.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]A prophecy tells of a "chosen one", the only one with enough strength and power to defeat the recently resurrected evil overlord.

While the gameplay is still rather simple, it is much more enjoyable now."  - [B]kentona[/B][CR][B]...::: Gameplay, Features and Comments :::...[/B] [CR] Frog, The Collector  is a game loosely based around the concepts of the arcade classics  Frogger  and  Pacman . You play as the eponymous Frog, a decidedly hungry chap who believes that the easiest way for him to gather food is to collect the scraps of fruit that bored, bratty children and stupid, unwashed truck-drivers throw out of their windows when they get bored of staring at the tarmac in front of them. Unfortunately for Frog, this means dancing with bumpers, frolicking with hubcaps and jumping past tyres...[CR] "But a frogs gotta do what a frogs gotta do!" [CR]So-called "features" include graphics styled on the arcade classics  Pacman  and  Frogger, an arcade-nostalgia inducing soundtrack created by  FoxSynergy, five levels of car-dodging fun, a digit-seperation system you can steal to create your own score displays, the constant thought, "What will happen if I max out the score bar!?" because not even the developer knows, your 5-a-day fruit requirement, and the possibility I will get sued in the next couple of weeks!</plot>

Weve all come to expect it, that one day well all be swept away by the Tide.[CR]Our faith in a higher authority is ordinary as it can be seen all around us. We hear things, music, voices, but that reaffirms our faith that were being watched over, or at the very least being watched. Some pray for protection, others gifts, you know, ordinary stuff. Those who wish for gifts come to regret what they wish for, but even then, what am I to say to them? Ordinary people make mistakes.[CR]Me? Im not in any rush to make mistakes, so I continue on my ordinary life and wait... and to be honest, that suits me just fine.[CR]I am an eel, and all my needs are met.[CR]__________________________________________________[CR]This is my first jump into the standard art/surreal venue of gaming. In it, youll have the choice to pursue little tidbits and slowly piece together the answer to why youre here, who you are, where youre going, and what youll become.[CR]My hope is that its interesting.[CR]Its also worth mentioning that all of the resources in this game were made by me.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: kentona[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B] ..:: GENERICA ::.. [/B]..:: OVERVIEW ::..[CR]Welcome to Generica! An RM2k3 RPG that will be created in a week in time for RS! Day VI. Done in that classic NES style (as seen in Dragon Fantasy II and Hellion), Generica will follow the story of our heroes as they leave their remote mountain village to kill the evil Slayer King. [CR]For 22 years the Slayer King has ruled Generica with an iron gauntlet. The general populace is cowed and broken, and the nobles, knights and armies are fighting wars in far off lands for the bloodthirsty and seemingly invincible Slayer King. Large tracks of land have been left fallow and overrun by the wilderness. Villages lay abandoned, and even cities seem like ghosttowns. Hopelessness rules the day. [CR]Our heroes must find the Gladius Generica - the only weapon capable of felling the evil lord - before it is too late. Yet the only one who knows its location is the reclusive old coot known as the Fisher King...and he is clearly insane... [CR]..:: NOTES ::..[CR]Like Hellion, this game will borrow heavily from our collective work on the (now defunct) community project of the same name (Generica), but instead of the gameplay and systems, this game will borrow the most from the story and plot. [CR]It is not a long game, but hopefully fun! </plot>

		<title_clean>Iron Gaia Virus</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Max McGee[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] A side-story to the sometimes popular and always controversial Iron Gaia series. Could be considered a Part 1.5 between the very early Part I and the never-completed Part II, but a more accurate analogy would be to call this a Resident Evil 3 to Iron Gaia Part Is Resident Evil 2. In other words, it deals with the same location (the Iron Gaia space station, the last hope of humanity derailed by an artificial intelligence gone mad with delusions of godhood) and the same events from the perspective of a completely different character.[CR]Iron Gaia: Virus is a post-apocalyptic spacepunk action-RPG, with elements of stealth gameplay. In terms of production values, the number one priority was to make something like System Shock 2 for rm2k3 and I think we were ultimately successful.[CR]This time, you play as Dietrich Slade also known as Sigmus the Fallen. Once a brilliant and gifted rocked scientist who was the chief of propulsion for the Iron Gaia project, Slade was rewarded by the Gaia for his role as Her creator by being in turn recreated by her. Rebuilt in Her image as one of her Celestials, angelic beings genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced to act as her servitors. [CR]As Slade tries to secure an exit from the self-destructing Iron Gaia space station, he meets someone from his distant past, one of the men who made him what he has become today. Dr. Cross, who he had believed dead. So, as he struggles to escape, he reflects on his journey, from man, to Celestial, and finally to become a kind of fallen angel, a dark God.[CR]While often eclipsed by its very early predecessor and its disastrous failure of a sequel, Iron Gaia: Virus is, in my opinion, definitely the best RPG I ever have or ever will make. It is complete, self-contained, and totally unique. [CR]If you like science fiction or RPGs at all...please, please, please play it.</plot>

		<plot>Kindred Saga not only showed that it was frustratingly possibly to create a custom side-view-battle-system in rpgmaker2000 but the game drew everything that we loved about the genre, during that time: The co-op battle skills seen in Chrono Trigger, the dark and foreboding eerie flash blacks of a menacing protagonist (as seen in FF7 and Xenogears) while also attempting to merge genres that were never thought were possible - Theres this really menacing almost, pulse pounding moment near the end of the demo, where they mix the chase sequence found in Final Fantasy 8 with Final Fantasy 6s ghost train - It is something youll have to experience for yourself.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: The Real Brickroad[CR]Game Status: Cancelled[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Kinetic Cipher is a traditional RPG which emphasizes stellar gameplay over graphics and sound. This is because I cant draw or compose, but I can design a wicked dungeon. And oh man do I mean wicked. Look at the screenshots for some examples at how wicked they are. Anyway, the game is pretty much canceled but oh well.[CR][B]Changes from KC(A)#4 to KC(A)#4.5:[/B][CR]- Made Robin not suck so much.[CR]- Robins Scrounge skill now scales based on her agility.[CR]- A bunch of stuff that was supposed to work, but didnt, now works.[CR]- New dungeon, town, and player character.</plot>

Because Smile Game Builder is like RPGMaker 2003 in many ways, just 3d options, I decided to step back up to the Lands of Lunori system, while giving my ideas and needs to the new program devs. As long as they lift the limitations on variables, switches, items, characters, etc.. I can remake Lands of Lunori system, take most the story and passion from this game and push it into a new game, "Era of Mana". Im excited to go back to my roots, its been too long![CR]The Guardians of Lunori must now gather to help avert the War. As the Dark Riders continue to do mass experiments to become Mystics and obtain the True power, the Guardians must convince the younger generations to take arms and fight for the sake of all Lunori.

		<title_clean>Last Quest IV The Prequeling</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Backwards_Cowboy[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Take on the role of Larz from the peaceful town to the west of the Forest Temple, whom must investigate the numerous screams coming from the forest at the request of Mayor Dad. After oversleeping and finding Mayor Dad outside waiting for him, Larz is allowed past the guard at the exit to the town. Upon arriving at the Forest Temple he encounters a young woman named Aeva, a healer from Castleton who was sent to investigate reports of monsters roaming the area near the temple. After solving the mystery, the two return to the peaceful town west of the Forest Temple only to discover that it has been destroyed by soldiers from Castleton, and they find themselves caught up in a conspiracy involving a now-evil King Castleton and a shadowy figure somehow connected to him.[CR]Last Quest IV: The Prequeling features the standard front-view battle system that is the core of most RPG Maker 2000 games, and an overworld map that was always so present in the games of my youth. The graphics are slightly updated using the RM 2003 RTP for chipsets, and some modified backgrounds and system graphics.[CR]This project is for the Golden Game Mak contest, and as such revolves around cliches and tropes. Due to the nature of the game, it is much less serious than a traditional RPG Maker game, and should not be taken seriously story-wise. This game is very short, typically taking me about 25-30 minutes per playthrough during testing. If you encounter any game-breaking bugs, please let me know.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Cap_H[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]This game was made as A Halloween Horror entry. It should be a horror game.[CR][/B][CR] Cerdic wakes up ashore a strange land. In the middle of a storm, he got a single thought. The thought is so essential, that he got a need to say it out loud. [CR]"Where is Sera."[CR][B]Left Behind[/B] follows Cerdic on his journey to find Sera. The first stop on the journey is an abandoned town. Where are all the people? Soon enough, The knight finds her first victim. Cerdic ought to hurry up. More mutilated corpses await us ahead and the sooner Sera is stopped, the better. While following the track of dead bodies, odd people talk to Cerdic about matters of life and death. Some of them just talk. The one thing Cerdic struggles to realize, is how long it has been since he was left behind.[CR]The game is mostly walk and talk with three light puzzles included to entertain you. Dialogues are minimalist and the same can be said about graphics, which are taken from the original  Final Fantasy  and an all MIDI soundtrack, which contains tunes from  Metroid, Big Nose The Caveman, Monster Party  and other NES classics. The current version uses RTP sounds.[CR]The game is rather short and it should take something over [B]10 minutes[/B] to finish it.[CR]While making  Left Behind , I was inspired by films such as  The Seventh Seal  and  Stalker . Among games  Space Funeral, Lone Survivor  and  Dragon Fantasy  were main sources of inspiration. It can be said, that i was trying to make a game, which looks like  Dragon Fantasy , feels like  Space Funeral  and is scary.[CR]AHH version should include the complete story with both endings.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Delsin7[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] LoP:ToM was made for the RMN 10th Anniversary Retro Game Jam. A list of retroisms in the game is included below.[CR]It is a semi-traditional RPG in the 8, 12, and 16-bit style. Made in 9 out of the alloted 10 days, of which several had little time working on it, it was quite the challenge. Adding quite a bit to this challenge is the fact that its made in RPG Maker 2000 which, until this point, I had not used before. Compared to more recent editions, VXA and MV, it is very hands-on and labor intensive. It does have its charm however.[CR]The focus is heavily on story and exploration. There is quite a bit of combat, being a JRPG-style game, but shouldnt pose too much trouble for anyone with moderate rpg skill. Because of that focus, and tradition, Im keeping most of the story and characters here very ambiguous. Because retro is love-pain![CR]It may see some future updates and additions, but most likely will see a port to MV to allow greater depth. (Which unfortunately steals it away from the Retro style.)[CR]Story-[CR]Perren is a far future setting in the distant past. Or was it the other way around? Something that ties its stories and legends are the story tellers. They may embellish on a story, or change it, but most stories have their origins in history.[CR]Long ago in the Isles, there was a time of prosperity. Good fish were gathered from the sea, gold and riches gleaned from its earth, and great ships sailed the air itself. But prosperity is fickle. Fueled by the ambitions of the Gafsk Republic the land is growing ever more hostile and the Four Elemental Artifacts power is fading. If their power fades, legend says the Isles will be no more. Hopefully a group of heroes will save the land and prevent this. Migrating island nations is such a pain.[CR]Characters-[CR]The Reaper: Controlling the powers of cold, wind, and death, this one has the unenviable task of reaping souls. That is, freeing bound spirits to the other side. This is also the main character.[CR]The Monster: A beast they call it. Lurking, creeping, destroying all that is good and pure. Is it really? Or is its guise simply a cruel trick of fate? Scholars arent quite sure.[CR]The Shining One: Powers of fire, lightning, and light are this ones speciality. Flying above the land the Shining One dispenses its own form of justice for the Malachite Throne. And perhaps...something greater.[CR]The Sloth: Only by being forced to learn magics of earth, water, and healing is this one of any real value. Perhaps the Sloth is a good being with low motivation? Or maybe its just a selfish thing that needs a good prodding.[CR]Other Things-[CR]Isles: The appropriately named islands of the archipelago south of the middle continent. It has a wide variety of locales thanks to the Four Elemental Artifacts and unusual island composition. Civilization here is quite old and many secrets await hardy explorers.[CR]Gafsk Republic: A foreign nation with a very centralized government. Some say only Empires are evil, but more than a few Republics are reaching for the crown. Gafsk is technologically, magically, economically, and militarily powerful. Surrounding independant nations look to Gafsk with growing trepidation.[CR]Celestial Court: The bureaucratic court of Gods, Goddesses, Forces, Powers, Deities, and more that rule the cosmos. Applicants for new Deities, returning Deities, or associate status seekers inquire with San-Guan.[CR]Retroisms:[CR]Warning, this may contain minor spoilers. Its intended for people curious as to what/why certain things in the game are. Or for people who didnt grow up playing 8-16-bit games.[CR]Names: Common in old rpgs is mistranslated or simplified names, such as Town or Mayor. This was done partly due to space limitations of text and because some names might not have been considered appetizing to the localization team. This also includes random CAPITILIZED LETTERS and conjugated words like FSteak.[CR]Four McGuffins: A common staple of jrpgs was having 4 mcguffins, usually of the four cardinal elements, as the major plot devices.[CR]Helpful/Unhelpful NPCs: Whether by translation error or intentionally cryptic some NPCs offer weird advice that may not be correct. Or they could contain massive hints or spoilers for the player who talks to everyone.[CR]Evil Empire: All Empires are evil. (Thanks HcBailly) Because its a JRPG. Although in this case its a Republic. And its not quite all evil. Just part of it.[CR]Treasure Everywhere: Old school games had lots of treasure. Especially the games where you only got a single potion or arrow out of each chest. There is a lot of treasure in this game, but[CR]I didnt go completely mad.[CR]Flying!: You know that feeling when the world opens up or you can suddenly go really fast? Flying does that. Getting an apparatus or vehicle that allows flight gives the player more options to go to more dungeons and die to that Ifreet with a bad hair day.</plot>

It is regarded as one of the classic games of the early 2k era and uses almost exclusively the RTP resources. It follows the story of the prince of a kingdom who has just engaged in battle with the neighbouring country, and his struggles to find out the truth behind not only his own history, but who is pulling the strings behind the war. With a large cast of characters, the game was quite well-received by most people, though it is quite dated by todays standards.[CR] Legion Saga  was made in RM2K and focuses on creating an experience alike to the Suikoden series of games, where collecting an army of people together in order to wage war against a corrupt country is a staple. It caught a bit of flak for being too like the first game of the Suikoden series, but many people still enjoyed the fresh twist it gave to typical jRPG stories. [CR]The graphics are almost all RTP, and maps do suffer from being large and empty in places. This is a symptom of the time in which it was made, though, as most attention was focussed on the story and systems of the game. The game boasts three types of battle systems - normal jRPG battles, one-on-one duels and larger-scale war battles. It also has a save carry feature with the next game of the series, allowing unlockable secrets when you copy your save file from a particular point in the game over to  Legion Saga II .[CR]If you can get past the slow walk speed and out-dated design sensibilities you may find yourself enjoying the story quite a bit.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Aremen[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]Part of the RPG Maker Classics Archive: an initiative to upload classic RM games so they are not forgotten.[/B] [CR]Developed by: Kamau[CR]Date of Release: 2002-2004[CR] Legion Saga III  is a fantasy game set in a medieval world on the brink of war. It is regarded as one of the classic games of the early 2k era, like its prequels,  Legion Saga  and  Legion Saga II . It follows the story of Kima, a disgraced warrior who decides to restore his homeland to its former glory. Difficulties arise, though, when another faction within the country rise up and causes a civil war at the same time as the country is under siege. With a large cast of characters, the game was quite well-received by most people.[CR] Legion Saga III  was made in RM2K and focuses on creating an experience similar to the Suikoden series of games, where collecting an army of people together in order to wage war against a corrupt government is a staple. Many people enjoyed the fresh twist it gave to typical jRPG stories, of which there are many.[CR]The graphics are a mix of RTP, custom and rips, and the clash of graphics can be quite a bit disconcerting sometimes. This is a symptom of the time in which it was made, though, as most attention was focussed on the story and systems of the game instead of looks. The game boasts three types of battle systems - normal jRPG battles, one-on-one duels and larger-scale war battles. There was also a card game included in some versions, though it appears that version is lost to time. It also has a save carry feature with the second game of the series, allowing unlockable secrets when you copy your save file from  Legion Saga II  (which can lead to extra unlockable secrets if the save file from  Legion Saga  was carried over as well).[CR]If you can get past the clash of graphics and some of the out-dated design sensibilities you may find yourself enjoying the game quite a bit. [CR][B]This version has the card game, extra sidequests, bug fixes and a lot of extras. Thanks to Eike for providing this version![/B]</plot>

		<plot>In addition to the main three Legion Saga games in the series, I also started making two more using RPG Maker 2003. These games were eventually cancelled as I moved away from 2D RPGs to focus on 3D action game design.[CR]Curse of Silence was an action-RPG along the lines of early Zelda games, while Legion Saga R was a full remake of the first game in the series with revised systems and narrative. Both are incomplete games, but fully playable up to a certain point.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: pianotm[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] This humble offering for the Golden Age of Game Mak has turned into a humble offering for the Revive the Dead 2: Deader or Alive event. As we all know, the Golden Age of Game Mak event was all about cliches and the Revive the Dead jam is all about bringing dead projects back to life, so in keeping with the projects original spirit (pun intended), this game will assuredly be loaded with them.[CR]You play as Loop, yes, shes sort of a discount Link, and I wish I could say she goes on a quest unlike any other, but she doesnt. She goes on a quest just like all of the others, as she cliches her way through Tropania (Trope-ania, see what I did there?). This game includes every cliche from the list I could, some in your face, others subverted, and it even includes a few cliches that arent on the list.[CR]After finding an evil cult in her basement, 15-year-old Loop discovers shes the Chosen One, a mighty warrior who must defeat an ancient evil thats been sealed away for 1000 years, and as luck would have it, its going to wake up this year. She travels silently through Tropania doing good deeds and proving herself mightier than seasoned warriors twice her age.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is standard. Since this is a week long event, Im making no effort at customization of the game engine. Strictly mapping and basic eventing are to be found here, with a few little tricks, but nothing fancy. There is the occasional custom sprite, and a custom battleback for areas with no matching RTP battlebacks, but nothing that wouldnt take a few minutes to make in Gimp or Gale.[CR]That said, Im trying to make it as fun and exploration friendly as possible, so there are some reasons to play.[CR]I tried for a complete game, but only ended up with a demo. Its a long demo, but still just a demo. If you want to review, feel free to rate it. Awful or great, the feedback is appreciated.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: LOVEgames[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] This is a completely realistic game about exactly what its like to work as an office temp. Absolutely everything is true and nothing is made up or embellished. Really.[CR]This is your first day working at C.C. and C., Inc, the Best Office Ever. In between completing the weird tasks youre given that dont really seem to have much to do with each other (and lets be honest here, arent exactly giving your Bachelors degree a run for its money), you must safely navigate the spooky office hallways.[CR]Youre not sure what makes the hallways so spooky. Maybe its the old, moldy smell. Or the weird noises made by the old building. Or maybe its the invisible monsters who chomp your head clean off if you linger for more than 20 seconds...[CR]As you navigate the endless office corridors with your trusty revolver at your side (well, not THAT trusty - cutbacks, you know), you must find a way out of this hellish place. Explore the office building and find hidden objects in the classic top-down view. When you hear the footsteps, hit the shift key to draw your gun and switch to the first-person view. Take care - you will never see the approaching monsters, but you can hear them.... [CR]Mouth Sweet brings to the table a delicious blend of dark comedy, existentialist despair, tense combat, and corporate ennui, scored with a skin-crawling original vocal soundtrack unlike any youve sampled before! Misery has never been so much fun! [CR]Isnt this the best job youve ever had? Well, Ive definitely had worse.[B]Features:[/B][CR]   Tense first-person battle system - listen for the invisible enemys footsteps, and shoot them before they get you! (requires stereo sound)  [CR]   Things former employers have actually said to me! What jerks!  [CR]   Original soundtrack made entirely out of my own voice!  [CR]   High level of challenge  [CR]   Looks good on your resume - C. C. and C. is a big name in this town  [CR]Tips for mastering the battle system:[CR]   Stereo sound is required!! Listen for the enemys footsteps. You will never see the enemy, but you can hear if it is to the right or left of you.  [CR]   Once the enemys footsteps are centered aurally, it is right in front of you. SHOOT NOW!! Youll know if youve hit it.  [CR]   Go slowly. Youve never used a gun before, at least not in an office setting. Move your gun hand one tick at a time, and listen for the footsteps each time.  [CR]   If you duck into a side room, the monster will stop looking for you. Maybe it forgot you were there? I dunno. It will start chasing you again if you re-enter the hallway, but maybe you can avoid it completely if you swoop in and out of side rooms. (sometimes, not always!)  [CR]   The first enemy you encounter is a little different from the others - it is much easier to defeat. Also, its next to a save point and an ammo refill. If youre still having trouble with the combat, use this first enemy as practice!  [CR]   Theres no shame in choosing Easy Mode. The only difference is that the enemies wont touch you - but YOU can touch THEM! Easy Mode makes good practice for this reason.  [CR]Thanks for playing!! [CR] You can also find this game on itch.io! [CR]CONTENT WARNING: Blood, guns, tension/anxiety, jump scares, implied animal cruelty. There is a chance that this game may misgender you, so please take care if youre sensitive to that!!</plot>

Monotheon, the setting of this world, is comprised of three different races: Humans, who are the majority in the world’s population; Halves, who can transform into humans or the bestial form of their ancestors at will; and Fulls, mythological beasts who may possess strength and size much larger than any human or half, yet are a rare site from underperforming Halves and Humans. Outside standard occupations, certain humans can harness a power called Spirit, a rare phenomenon that gives the user’s greatest desires physical manifestation, while others, fearing the power of Halves and Fulls, are Half-hunters, warriors specializing in traps to exploit the weaknesses of Halves.  Halves can use Mystic Energy, a genetic, attribute-based trait they can only manipulate while in human form.  Where these differences lie, conflict breathes…[CR]The Light Dragons, centuries ago, gave Halves an equal chance of survival against Humans and Fulls by securing them sanctuary at the center of Monotheon, high in the mountains, in a haven called Ark.  After Halves spread to every corner of the world, the Light Dragons vanished, leaving Ark abandoned.  When a council headed by Dark Dragons, Fire Sharks, Wind Bears, Water Bats, and Earth Moles decided to preserve Ark for study, a dissenting sect of Light Tigers and their allies seized the city for themselves, and, renaming themselves the White Tigers, began a crusade to unit all of Monotheon under their authority.  The war seemed bleak, until the Dark Dragons, who swore neutrality during the war, provided clandestine funding to the newly united Spirit users of humanity.  The White Tigers’ ambitions yielded, humanity was selected to guard Ark, renamed Sanctum, and to keep all Halves involved with the White Tigers under close surveillance.[CR]The story begins in the present with Jermaine Tesla and his two best friends, Zirconia Templar and Paul Scabbard, all Halves and prodigies of the Dark Dragon Clan, about to take their final exams to become adults.  On the personal front, Jermaine and Zirconia’s fathers are constantly competing while developing new technologies for their clan, while Paul’s father is a soldier, defending the Dark Dragons from prejudice Humans and rival Halves on a daily basis.  On the political front, the new chief of the Light Tigers is showing leniency towards White Tiger war criminals, while prejudices between Humans and Halves are on the rise, despite leadership from a new, ambitious Arch-Bishop of Sanctum.  As Jermaine, Zirconia, and Paul step into the world, the differences between its populace, and the differences amongst themselves, will threaten to destroy the friendship they cherish, and the world they love.</plot>

A demo was released to a mixed reception. Even longer ago, a demo was released under the name Universal Language.[CR]~~~ NEEDLESS TO SAY, ~~~ this game in its current form is  heavily  cancelled. Id drawn up a number of blueprints for different iterations over the years, though, and Id love to return to NotSMW one day. Theres a good chance of it happening, too. Itll likely be under the name Notes on the Second Lassallian War, to fit with the lore of my more recent games. This is a LONG, LONG way off, though. Best to treat this game like its cancelled completely, because it quite possibly is~[CR]The rest of the gamepage has been left as it was.[CR]~~~~~~~~[CR][B]Synopsis[/B][CR]1874 - Seven years after the end of the Great War, the continent of Mellynd still has a long way to go before it is at peace. In Leyland, the Avenburyite Liberals are at permanent odds with the Watsonite Conservatives over the responsibilities of their role as victors. In Orville, the president of the unpopular and impotent postwar government has to deal with a growing extremist threat. And in Edgos, a bloody revolution sees the beloved lord of the realm overthrown by a motley and unstable group of multinational revolutionaries. In Leyland, working-class university-liberal Amos Hardie and his blue-collar friends are forced to adapt to life on the streets as war refugees. In Orville, failed actor and all-talk nationalist Cpt. Hahn Gerhard Krause and his men facilitate their countrys transition from shaky democracy to Orwellian dictatorship with roughly 45% foreboding and 55% ambivalence. And in Edgos, kind-hearted clergyman Eilert Lyon struggles against the current of revolutionary absolutist bureaucracy in order to protect his church, his library and, ultimately, himself.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: riderx40[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR]   In an ancient world, a war between mortals and immortals was beginning. The fabled Gate of Oblivion, the bridge between the realm of demons and the land of the living, had been opened.[CR]The Evil Lord, the bane of all life and the ruler of all demons, saw this opportunity to unleash his incorporeal plague upon the mortal plane of existence. Wildlife, possessed by evil spirits, mutated into hostile creatures, and demons themselves went from being invisible, spiritual beings to physical monsters. Under the command of their king, they wreak havoc across the world with the goal of eliminating or enslaving all mortal life in existence.[CR]Among the chaos now known as the Oblivion Crisis, the small kingdom of Rydir suffers from a terrible dilemma. The princess of Rydir, Lyra, has been kidnapped by demon forces, according to her father, the king. He enlisted the help of a mysterious mercenary, named Tenda, to retrieve the princess and vanquish the demon scourge from the world.[CR]There is more to Tenda than meets the eye, however, and perhaps even more about the kingdom he made promises to.</plot>

The Batter, and yourself as his controller, are dropped off in zone 0, the first of 4 zones in a perplexing, unknown world about which you slowly find out more and more in the process of the game.[CR]OFF has been praised and known as an insiders tip between French gamers for its strong story, great characters and incredible atmosphere. Though we had to fix a few bugs in it so that the latter works on every Windows computer (the required system to play this game), I strongly agree to these opinions.[CR]The game is originally released in 2008 and the credit goes to Mortis Ghost,Unproductive Fun Time and Reconstructed Game Team.</plot>

[CR][B]The underground world of Labyrinth is a dangerous place, but not quite as dangerous as the surface! Thousands of years have been spent by various walks of life settling down in different parts of the Labyrinth, going about their lives just as they would if the unstoppable forces on the surface werent there. But lying within the center of the Labyrinth is a being only spoken of as a mere myth, one who has the power to grant any wish, that is, to whoever can reach him. Many have made it their lifelong duty to find the center of the winding labyrinth, only to be stopped by Natural perils that the labyrinth offers, or the greedy foes who stop anyone trying to progress.[CR]In this game, you play as Olli, a young soul who has been tasked to find their two sisters. Your adventure will send you throughout many parts of the Labyrinth, and meet strange characters, many of whom want to kill you, very badly! So be careful! [/B][CR][B]Ollimio is an rpgmaker game I have been working on for almost a year now. Nearly everything in the game (nix the engine itself and a few tracks   My good friend Alex Sandberg  has provided) has been a personal project. Though the game is mostly story-driven, a few unique aspects to the game, such as farming, fishing, and weapon crafting will be present. The entire story to Ollimio is complete, mapping out that story through rpgmakers engine and creating all the music and art warrants unknown deadlines, but provides an interesting backdrop to a story Ive wanted to tell for a long time. I would like to push out a demo out this year that will include the entire first chapter (of 9), and show off the farming mechanic. Cant wait to show you all![/B][CR]-JR</plot>

You are saved by an angel, who explains to you that the kid is actually the "Onyx Boy", one who knows of the location of the Onyx, an object of pursuit by many powerful forces. The angel calls you the "Peditra", the only one who can connect with the Onyx Boy and destroy the Onyx.[CR] So now youre left with two options...help save the new world of Allumia, which is nearly exactly like your old home...or, find a way back to your own original world.

Two modes are available, Classic and Adventure. The classic mode is very similar to the original Pac-Man, the fruits will be replaced by the characters in the series who can come to your aid to defeat the monsters that are replaced by the Emperor and his band. Adventure mode is, rather, a series of tests and Boss that you have to succeed in a race against the clock or every second is important for the final score.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: seacliff217[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Phantom.Negative is a retro styled game inspired by older NES RPGs such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest/Warrior. The game takes many visual and system design choices based on these older games (except random encounters, screw those) and tries to emulate them while running on the very limited, yet nostalgic, RPG Maker 2000. The game was created in a little less than 3 weeks.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The settlement of Seacliff is a realm ruled by the Branchaline Empire. Kairos, lord of Seacliff and son of the emperor of Branchaline, is sicken by his fathers tyranny and wants to make Seacliff an independent nation. The emperor finds out about Kaiross plans to break away from the empire and demands that he continues to rule Seacliff under the empires name or he will turn the entire nation into ashes.[CR]Kairos may have some of the worlds strongest warriors under him, but they are no match to the empires numbers. However, Kairos is aware of a legend passed down by the lands natives about an incredible power underneath the ancient ruins. Kairos off on an adventure to find this power, hoping it will at least deflect the power of the empire.[CR][B]Features:[/B][CR]-Traditional turn based combat[CR]-About an hour or so of game play (RPG 2K does not keep track of playtime, so rough estimate)[CR]-3 dungeons[CR]-Enough enemy variety to not reuse the same troop combination twice[CR]-Optional bosses that will unlock new skills and abilities[CR]-No loading times when entering buildings</plot>

		<title_clean>Phylomortis II</title_clean>
		<plot>Phylomortis II: The Triumvirate of Dystopia is about the severance of the phylogenetic structure which has held sway since time immemorial. Whereupon the aforementioned structure ceased, many - indeed most - humans transformed or evolved into alien beings and unfamiliar beasts, inherited various traits such as super intelligence, strength, or amorphous bodies. The game opens on the Miniveh Convention Hall, where the main character's father is scheduled to give a lecture on the Symphony of the Harvest - a songshape that has the ability not only of healing crops that have been damaged by the Phylomortis, but also of rejuvenating the soil. Technically it speeds up the ATP synthesis in the Kreb's cycle, but that is another story! After the lecture is given and received, the main character's father, Legate Arrinson, goes downstairs and meets up with a performer who is a fan of his work. As they chat, the performer notices that there are strange men behind Legate carrying bionuclear weapons with Syprin principality ensignias on them. They are later identified as bio-terrorists from a faction dedicated to wiping out shapers - those who control planes of energy unseen. Keene and Konner - Legate's entourage - attack the soldiers but are quickly defeated because of a terrible gas that causes them to become weakened. As the soldiers finish Legate's entourage as well as he himself, a young girl calls to the main character and he is called to an underground room under the Convention Hall. The girl introduces herself as Elsa. She is an psychotic woman who has different powers depending on her moods -- her 'inner child' mood is triggered whenever something scares her or excites her adequately; her 'philosopher' mood is triggered whenever intellectual dishonesty is upon the party or else something causes her to think abnormally deeply about a subject; and her 'rebellious' mood is triggered by anything that pisses her off.</plot>

And, then, recover all the money stolen by bandits and precious stones that they lost when they hid from the place of the flight. On the way, we will meet the policeman Farfouille, who is also better to stay away, and the cute kitty, after kissing, Hercules will increase the speed of the movement, but only before taking the next article. In the game, there is an episode of the animated series, a series of "Taxi Follies", about crazy taxis. We will also have to remove the stolen jewelry from thieves, we will be hindered by Busard, the deputy chief of the gang.

Hes never been particularly thrilled about his job, but, the bus is uncomfortably late. As it becomes more and more apparent that hes not going to be on time today, Andrew decides to call the day off, and goes back home. He does not expect anything to happen on the way back, and yet, he comes across some very peculiar happenings.[CR]Personal Asides[CR]This short game was made with the Steam version of RPG Maker 2K3, and it was pretty fun to do. It takes about 10 minutes, and has three different endings. The general idea is that each time players get an ending, they see a certain part of the story, and make their own conclusions.[CR]This game was very much inspired by Wither and Ghost Suburb II. The characters are based off of edits of work done by CARRIONBLUE, while some musics/sounds are from freesound.org. Most other work is from RPG Maker 2K3s run-time package.</plot>

Leaving on a journey of self-discovery, Ryle eventually uncovers not only the secret of his past, but one of world-shattering importance. Joining Ryle in his travels are a bevy of lovely ladies who he may choose to romance and bond with through interactions within the story. [CR]Romancing Walker was made in rm2k and utilizes hand-drawn anime sequences in battle, as well as pictures during important cut-scenes. The biggest draw of the game, however, is the dating simulation which allows you to bond with the other party members. The choices you make during certain scenes will either draw them closer or push them away. [CR]While the game does suffer from Engrish and bad grammar in some parts, it is considered a classic and one of the few games of its time that is complete, with a decent epic tale, interesting characters and interaction between your party. Add in the back-then great graphics in and out of battle and you have a game that is well-remembered as one of the best.</plot>

You have silenced me!"[/B][CR][B]The Premise[/B][CR]A young man receives a call from his girlfriend, inviting him over to watch a movie or two. The couple, laying about on the couch, watches the actors onscreen portray their roles as the hours pass. Midnight arrives. [CR]The world ends. [CR]The sky is cast a dark red, and the sun turns as black as coal. Where once the streets were walked by people, they are now host to beings of night, unclean creatures that seek the flesh of the living. [CR]The couple discovers their talent to fend off these creatures, and they flee for their lives. [CR]"What's going on? Are there any survivors? How did this happen? Is it just our city, or is it the entire state? The country? The world? What do we eat? Where do we sleep? [CR]...Can we ever be safe again?" [CR][B]The Gameplay[/B] [CR]Speak No Evil is styled after the Shin Megami Tensei model of gameplay, and is thus a battle-heavy, relatively difficult experience focused on elemental affinities; labyrinthine dungeons, and bosses that require an understanding of mechanics to defeat. [CR]The most prevalent aspect of the game is the importance of elemental weaknesses. Striking a weakness deals five times more damage than normal - very rare are the occasions where this isn't an instant kill. So, the experimentation with elements, and the discovery of which are effective and which are not, is a central aspect of the game's design. As the player progresses, groups of enemies where one is immune to - or even absorbs - the other's weakness become increasingly common. [CR]This might have proven frustrating, had new enemies with new sets of skills appeared in each area. However, Speak No Evil was built to prevent this by re-using enemy species - simply with higher levels. This, in turn, might have lead to a lack of enemy variety. Which is, technically, true - there aren't that many distinct enemy types in this game. There are, however, a large number of enemy troop configurations; and this is the biggest key to Speak No Evil's battles. Enemies that can berserk the player are paired with enemies that are immune to physical attacks; those that are highly vulnerable to magic are paired with those that sap the player's SP. It all comes together to create a situation where the player is constantly threatened, without being ball-bustingly hard. </plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: BadLuck[CR]Game Status: Cancelled[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Episode 1 of my failed experiment in making the simplest game I could. What it lacks in solid gameplay, it makes up for in charm.[CR]My games prior to this one were notorious for being ambitious and buggy and messy. Starlancer Six is clean, simple and reasonable.[CR]Its the story of a young girl who inexplicably obtains magical powers which she uses to attack and destroy the dark world. This was intended to play out like a 13-episode anime series, but I lost interest in it shortly after completing episode one.[CR]Still, its a fun little diversion. I think youll enjoy it. And if youve ever wondered what the bridge between Ara Fell and Rise of the Third Power is, this is it.[CR]Youll notice some annoying game design flaws with the dungeon, you cant tell what switches did when you use them, and you cant tell which doors are locked until you try them.</plot>

And as pen was put to paper, swords clashed in a far off corner of the world as The Knights Family fought valiantly to destroy the diabolical quell known as The Egg. An artefact that reveled in the bloodshed as it absorbed the anima of those who fell in battle. And over the course of one day, Sandail was finally enshrouded in the tranquility that came with peace.[CR]Now 100 years later, the once benevolent Finney Empire has turned its back on the Peace Treaty. And as war looms on the horizon, four heroes brought together by destiny will be thrown into the conflict, and tested against all odds.[CR]Meanwhile, in the midst of all this. A strange person who carries the name of a Hero of legend appeared. Has he a hand in the oncoming devestation that will sweep the land? Or is he too, just another pawn of fate?[CR]Steel Spirit SaGa is a fan-made sequel to SaGa Frontier 2 (Though you wont have to play SF2 in order to understand the story) that is divided into 4 scenarios. Originally Steel Spirit SaGa was going to be an entirely different game altogether. But the writing took me in a direction that made me decide to make this a sequel.</plot>

Theme: Non-fiction horror. It is inspired by a  real life crime that happened in Brazil .[CR]On October 31st 2002, a couple was found dead in their bed. What first appeared to be a burglary followed by murder left too many unusual traces, and the police soon figured that whoever did it was probably someone familiar with that house. Less than a week of investigation revealed that the murder was planned by the couples own daughter, with the help of her boyfriend and his brother.[CR]The game tries to reenact this story from the perspective of various characters involved. Each scene is focused on a different character, and uses a different style of gameplay to represent his motivations and goals.[CR] Suzy and freedom  is NOT, however, an attempt to recreate the original story in a completely faithful and exact fashion.</plot>

During this adventure, however, you have it quite unclear what has happened: All that you know is that you have lost your memory and woken up inside your own dream, to be greeted by an elder man standing on a small island...[CR]The game takes place in a material dimension which acts as a varying, but crossroad between multiple material and few ethereal dimensions. Meaning the lands can first be quite calm medieval castles and humble wooden buildings, while the neighboring town is rolling with nuclear power and and modern technology.[CR]Other main characters besides Captain Maloneum are optional to get to your party, though they all add color and possibilities to the gameplay. To put them stereotypically, one of them is ranged weapon user, one is offensive mage, one is rogue-style.[CR]In addition, each of the playable characters and major locations of the game have different endings, depending on your actions during the gameplay. Most of these are only attainable with special abilities of the optional party members. Though the endings dont affect the game itself in any way (Well, because the game has ended by the time you get them) but they are something to add to the replay and fun value. Oh, and on a sidenote: If you take this game seariously, you have lost the game![CR]-Levels from 1 to 20[CR]-4 different characters[CR]-Play time 1-3 days[CR]-Multiple endings[CR]-Masculinity[CR]Reviewers say:[CR]-1/5 starts[CR]-"It looks better than it is."</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: bleet[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Huntress of the Hollow is a short, linear, pseudo-rpg game where the battles add more flavor to the narrative than to a true rpg. Its a slight spin on Little Red Riding Hood: a coming of age story where the hunted becomes the hunter.[CR][B]Background:[/B][CR]Lenora Calamint lives with her mother in a small village called Pokeweed Hollow on the outskirts of a forest. She often delivers food to her stubborn grandmother, who prefers to live alone in the woods. While the forest is a dangerous place full of wolves, the village and her grandmothers house were peaceful.[CR]However, once a travelling, charismatic hunter decided to settle near the village and offered to protect it, the local wolves became mysteriously violent and began to attack the village in erratic bursts of activity. Due to these events, some villagers praise the hunter for his help in keeping the wolves out of their homes. The others cant help but think theres something suspicious about the matter. Despite it all, Lenora still has a grandmother to take care of, and so she wakes up to begin her routine of visiting her grandmother anew.[CR][B]Play This Game If You Like:[/B][CR]  100% original graphics  [CR]  Dialogue-heavy narration and storylines  [CR]  Quick games that complete in 1hr or under  [CR]  Female protagonists  [CR]  Multiple endings  [CR]  Unnecessary sprint and crawl toggle mechanics that are fun anyway so sure whatever  [CR]  Pokemon Yellow-inspired color palettes  [CR]  Western fairytale retellings that dont have too much grimdark  [CR]  The color pink  [CR][B]Huntress has had over 4000 downloads its total lifespan!

		<plot>It's a 40-60 hour game, all told.[CR]Dozens of people have now downloaded it, and played it, and many have finished it. I've received a lot of positive response from it, as well, and I want more people to give it a spin. I designed the game with Dragon's Den in mind- the game is full of Dragon Warrior monsters, music, and spells, and the gameplay is similar to that of Dragon Warrior games. However, it adds an element of humour, storyline depth, and gameplay in the form of sidequests/secrets that make it a unique experience that DW/DQ fans might be able to appreciate even more!</plot>

		<plot>The Nothingness is the first project of Teo Mathlein, creator of Sunset over Imdahl. Like the latter, the game contains custom hand-drawn decorations but, on the other hand, they are less worked than in Sunset over Imdahl. We also feel a less mature atmosphere than its popular game cited above. RTPs are a bit of a task at the beginning of the game but then it goes. The game remains interesting for those who want more after completing Sunset over Imdahl. This is an unfinished demo but still worth a look. PS: If the game is classified Futurist it's due to the fact that we can see guns and robots at times even if this screen does not show it. Also, I have (DarkRPG) fixed a few missing resource bugs for that he is suitable. Besides, do not be surprised if you see the panorama of the forest during the slimes mini-game, the panorama for this scene was not there, so I replaced it for this one.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: Scumdrop[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Begun in the year 2000 and completed in 2006, "The Sword and the Fish" would become the second-most downloaded RM2000 game featured on the old Ultima Island website - enough to earn a place among other far more famous RPGs on  www.tvtropes.com . It also spawned a fun  40-page comic  you can read should you fancy.[CR]AND FANCY YOU SHOULD![CR]Explosions galore! Maps a-plenty! Enough equipment boxes to kill a small horse! Yes, The Sword and the Fish is the game youve been waiting for - assuming you have been waiting for an archaic-looking game wherein the hero is a scruffy amoral hick. What it lacks for presentation, it later makes up for in presentation! And all the while you can laugh along with the most ridiculous cast of characters to ever operate in an A-B, up, down, left, right universe. The ancient demonlord GWAR (yeah, thats right) has awakened and begun nefarious works, but all our hero CLIFFORD wants to do is rock out in a bad local band. Ambitions are for the weak! Alas, the fates are jerks and Clifford soon finds himself forced to save the world, like, three times. At least. Maybe even more![CR]Join Clifford as he foils his villages local cult, gets headbutted by love, meets robots from the future, engages in tomfoolery, realizes the robots arent really from the future, goes on trial for thuglettry, and tracks down and kills 7 powerful demons - before taking on Gwar himself![CR]Delicious!</plot>

		<title_clean>The Tiamat Sacrament</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Drakonais[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR]The Tiamat Sacrament currently is 100% complete, with about 20 or more hours of gameplay. Some sections, like the stealth missions and Vulcan Cannon dodging, are now skippable for those who are experiencing extreme lag in those parts. Ive had several bug testers crunch through the entire game and it should be smooth sailing, but let me know by PM if you run into any trouble and Ill be quick to fix it.[CR][B]SKILL ACQUISITION[/B][CR]Each character has a unique way of learning and utilizing their skills, from Blue Magic-style skill acquisition to element combo breath attacks that take multiple turns to build up. [CR]1.) Azuar, the dragon and main character, has 35 different possible class evolutions. Each class brings with it a different and unique skill and its own set of weaknesses and strengths. Additionally, having a Soul Gem equipped in battle adds automatically to unique variables that eventually impart skills of their own. Think Magicite from FFVI. This is on top of the breath techniques he can use by inhaling up to three Runes at a time.[CR]2.) Xandra, the scholar and artist, can learn skills by observing enemies use them in battle. She can acquire over 40 different skills in this fashion, with each serving a special purpose and scaling to her intelligence as she levels up. She comes in handy as support for the two fighting characters, but can deal elemental damage and status effects as well.[CR]3.) Kelburn, the Saphirite lieutenant, can wield two Rune Blades at once. While each Rune Blade comes with its unique skill while equipped, the characteristics of two Rune Blades equipped simultaneously blend together and create a new and even more powerful skill (e.g. a poison blade and a double-attack blade create an even more powerful poison skill). Furthermore, when Azuar inhales, Kelburn temporarily learns Rune Blade skills that typically focus Azuars breath into a targeted attack (e.g. a heal all spell becomes a heal one ally spell thats  much  more effective).[CR]Every skill employed by enemies in battle is obtainable and can used by one the partys three heroes under the right conditions. [CR][B]GAMEPLAY[/B][CR]The game is heavily story-driven with plenty of puzzles along the way. Ive retooled the battles so that they are challenging but dont drag out or slow down game progress. Ive made a point to design the game so no one should have to grind. Im not saying you cant grind for extra levels, but if you use the right tactic, you wont have to mill around fighting random encounters to succeed. Hopefully, with 35 different dragon evolutions and a bunch of optional quests with extra skills and items to be found, the player will be able to customize their gameplay experience.[CR]Each of the three characters have an ability set that depends heavily on the abilities of teammates. This system makes for strategic use of attacks, items, buffs, and specials. I hope you enjoy the game and leave any feedback you might have.</plot>

[CR]HIGHLIGHTS[CR]-Its a complete, finished game (divided into 6 episodes)[CR]-won Game of the Year at the 2003 and 2004 Misao Awards (episodes 4 and 5 were released in 2004)[CR]-winner of over 25 different Misao Awards[CR]-20+ mini-games[CR]-A one-on-one dueling system[CR]-Branching storyline dependent on players choices[CR]-3 different endings[CR]-Hundreds of action packed cut scenes[CR]-Hundreds of character animations[CR]-Over 50 unique faces with lots of different expressions[CR]-Hundreds of custom character graphics[CR]-20+ optional side quests[CR]-Unique XL magic system[CR]-Unique Aura system for attack and defense[CR]-Hundreds of secret items[CR]BRANCHING STORYLINE[CR]As you wander the way, you will face many choices of what to do or say at certain junctures. These decisions, in total, will have far reaching effects and perceptibly alter certain events as the game progresses and culminates in 3 different endings.[CR]LOTS OF EXTRAS[CR]The Way is a game of many mysteries and many secrets. The curious and clever will both reap great rewards.[CR]PLAY IT YOUR WAY[CR]The Way is a game that allows players to play the way they want. Dont be confused, its really quite simple: Both puzzles and battles can be turned on or off at any save point in the game. When battles are off, players can instantly defeat any foes they come across. Thus, they can quickly build levels if they so wish. The only catch is that skipping certain battles and [CR]puzzles prevents some special bonuses from being bestowed. [CR]GRAPHICS[CR]The Way features many custom graphics, including a plethora of facesets. The hero, Rhue, has nearly 50 different expressions, making him one of the most expressive heroes in RPG history. While the style used in The Way is similar to Rm2ks default graphics, the majority of the graphics are original works. Most notably, The Way makes use of lush environments rendered in Bryce 3D. If you think most Rm2k games look the same, its time to look again. There is nothing quite like The Way.[CR]THE PLUNGE SYSTEM[CR]In The Way, rivals often duke it out in a one-on-one duel. Participating in such a duel is known as "taking the plunge." The Plunge operates on a distinct set of attributes and skills, which the player can improve in many ways to create the perfect warrior. Theres much to be won and lost by taking the plunge, whether the battle rages in a quiet valley or with a wild [CR]fan-packed arena, complete with a roaring crowd and sensational entrances.[CR]THE AURA SYSTEM[CR]You will never find yourself equipping new armor or a new sword in The Way, at least not in the typical sense. Instead, The Way uses auras to help players improve their attack and defensive powers. By defeating foes with various auras "equipped" you will improve an auras stats and learn new specialized skills. Additionally, players who find out which aura an enemy is weak to will be able to cause extra damage. [CR]THE NOTCH SYSTEM[CR]The Notch System is another way to increase abilities in The Way. During the course of the game, players will come across items which can be set into a notch on the heros sword. By absorbing these items, the hero will acquire new skills and increase various attributes. Absorption is accomplished by defeating foes and gaining specialized points. Given the number of notch items in the game, it is largely the players decision as to what skills or attributes they want to increase.[CR]AWARDS[CR]2003 Misao Awards: The Way (Episodes 1-3)[CR]-Best game of the year [CR]-Best Dungeons [CR]-Best Individual Character - Rhue[CR]2004 Misao Awards: The Way (Episodes 4-5)[CR]Best game of the year [CR]Best cast[CR]Best CMS[CR]Best character[CR]Best graphics[CR]Best dialogue[CR]Best game series[CR]Best minigame, 2004[CR]Best music, 2004[CR]Best plot, 2004[CR]Best coded game[CR]Best villain[CR]Best supporting character[CR]Most mysterious character[CR]Most technically advanced game[CR]2005 Misao Awards: The Way (Episode 6)[CR]-Most promising story[CR]-Darkest story[CR]-Most dramatic way[CR]-Best opening sequence[CR]-Best non-cliched game[CR]-Best pacing game[CR]-Best dialogue[CR]-Game that Best Plays with Your Emotions[CR]-Best story, 2005[CR]-Most mysterious character[CR]EPISODE 1s STORY[CR]The Way follows the story of Rhue of Landorin, a young wanderer on a quest to regain a piece of his past.

These decisions, in total, will have far reaching effects and perceptibly alter certain events as the game progresses and culminates in 3 different endings. [CR]LOTS OF EXTRAS [CR]The Way is a game of many mysteries and many secrets. The curious and clever will both reap great rewards. [CR]PLAY IT YOUR WAY [CR]The Way is a game that allows players to play the way they want. Dont be confused, its really quite simple: Both puzzles and battles can be turned on or off at any save point in the game. When battles are off, players can instantly defeat any foes they come across. Thus, they can quickly build levels if they so wish. The only catch is that skipping certain battles and [CR]puzzles prevents some special bonuses from being bestowed. [CR]GRAPHICS [CR]The Way features many custom graphics, including a plethora of facesets. The hero, Rhue, has nearly 50 different expressions, making him one of the most expressive heroes in RPG history. While the style used in The Way is similar to Rm2ks default graphics, the majority of the graphics are original works. Most notably, The Way makes use of lush environments rendered in Bryce 3D. If you think most Rm2k games look the same, its time to look again. There is nothing quite like The Way. [CR]THE PLUNGE SYSTEM [CR]In The Way, rivals often duke it out in a one-on-one duel. Participating in such a duel is known as "taking the plunge." The Plunge operates on a distinct set of attributes and skills, which the player can improve in many ways to create the perfect warrior. Theres much to be won and lost by taking the plunge, whether the battle rages in a quiet valley or with a wild [CR]fan-packed arena, complete with a roaring crowd and sensational entrances. [CR]THE AURA SYSTEM [CR]You will never find yourself equipping new armor or a new sword in The Way, at least not in the typical sense. Instead, The Way uses auras to help players improve their attack and defensive powers. By defeating foes with various auras "equipped" you will improve an auras stats and learn new specialized skills. Additionally, players who find out which aura an enemy is weak to will be able to cause extra damage. [CR]THE NOTCH SYSTEM [CR]The Notch System is another way to increase abilities in The Way. During the course of the game, players will come across items which can be set into a notch on the heros sword. By absorbing these items, the hero will acquire new skills and increase various attributes. Absorption is accomplished by defeating foes and gaining specialized points. Given the number of notch items in the game, it is largely the players decision as to what skills or attributes they want to increase.

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2000[CR]Author: iishenron[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] General storyline:[CR]Many years ago, a mysterious group of monsters called "Kaibutsu" appeared in Durham Kingdom and ravaged the land. No one was able to resist their power, that is, until a hero named Carolus emerged. He was able to defeat the Kaibutsu leader, who happened to be his sister, and save the nation. After this, the people made him their king. However, 65 years have passed since his victory, and gradually, as he has aged, he has surrendered more of his political power to his vassal dukes, who have very different ideas on how the kingdom should be run.[CR]All of this is trivial background noise for a certain bartender from a backwoods forest town. Vance, the bartender in question, is bored with life, and decides he needs some excitement and some big money. The less actual hard work involved, the better. And nothing will stand in his way ...[CR][B]Features:[/B][CR]Three the Hard Ways gameplay is pretty typical as far as Rm2k games go, but there are a few wrinkles here and there ( such as leveling up ) that may throw you for a loop.  Pretty much everything you need to know is explained in game when you need to know it.</plot>

		<plot>Without warning, there was an explosion. Immediately the sirens went off, as they were designed to do if the main walls were breached. A cloaked figure walked out, followed by two strangely dressed..were they men? It was impossible to tell. They wore heavy suits of armour and carried swords. A sharp contrast indeed to the corridor they had entered, full of technology, blinking consoles and wires everywhere. The small party hadn't gone far when two security guards approached, cocked their pistols and pointed them at the intruders. At the same time a robot of some kind appeared through a door above them. "This is a restricted area!" barked the first, "Identify yourself!" "Out of my way fool!" hissed the stranger. Taking a closer look at the intruder, the guard laughed and turned to his colleague. "A minor threat." he said carelessly, "Let the Mech deal with it." Chuckling to themselves, the guards walked away as the Mech fired a missile towards the three. Just before it hit, the cloaked figure muttered some strange words; "Niot cetorpe mevigruom racitsym!" Oblivious to this, the guards carried on even as the missile exploded. They had almost reached the laboratory when... "Careful, that almost tickled." Thinking they must be hearing things, the guards turned slowly round, horrified to see that the cloaked figure appeared to be unhurt. The first guard took a deep breath. "What the hell are you?!" "Im-impossible!" cried the other. "Nothing could have survived that!" "Enough games, I don't have time for this." the mysterious man's voice was shrill and unforgiving, as he uttered another series of seemingly nonsensical words. "Seime neym etimsem alfralos!" It was the last thing the guards ever heard as searing heat engulfed them and the mech.</plot>

		<title_clean>Vindication</title_clean>
		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: LockeZ[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Vindication is a traditional RPG created in RPG Maker 2003 over the course of more than five years. It uses a real-time battle system similar to Final Fantasy games from the SNES and PSX eras. The game is about 15-30 hours long and features several side-quests and multiple difficulty settings, with eight major playable characters.[CR]Vindication is a constant barrage of off-the-wall comedy.  A game where eccentric characters encounter absurd situations non-stop. The humor assaults the player at full-speed as the characters are assaulted by 80s style robots from the future, struck by meteors, and forced to take pity on villains who try their best to be evil but fail miserably.[CR]But in its more serious moments, Vindication is primarily the story of one man, James Clyde. His quest for revenge against those who have wronged him rules his life, but begins to conflict with his desire to protect his daughter, while a force capable of destroying the world is left unchecked, even encouraged. It is an epic tragedy hidden within a whirlwind of wacky hijinks and terrible puns.[CR]While unarguably a story-driven game, Vindication also strives to create a meaningful challenge for the player. Each character has a unique set of abilities which must be utilized to their fullest to overcome a variety of obstacles. Constant party changes and splits keep you on your toes and require you to come up with new battle strategies constantly, while still rewarding you for developing your team members and building your strength. On the harder difficulty setting, the game plays almost like a survival horror game, with very limited resources and no way to replenish them, forcing you to manage your items wisely in order to survive the dungeons and defeat the bosses, which are stronger and faster than usual.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Red-Cube[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR]Foreword:[CR]Some of you might think "hey, what about this Galios thingy?". Well, due to it's vastly unfinished character and it's quite dated graphics I decided to put it off until the new demo is complete. But don't worry, I got something far better for you... [CR]This is a slightly enhanced and fully translated version of a very early game I made back in 2009. At the time it was meant to be a minor project beside another one. Long story short, the main project has been canceled and this one took it's place! :D [CR]Story:[CR]It's the year 3097. A dreadful war between the humans and a strange alien race has raged for nearly three decades. With reasons largely forgotten, hatred and greed keep pushing the bloodshed ahead.[CR]To fill in the countless losses and calm the public discontent the government resorts to artifically bred Human-Alien-Hybrids. Cheap yet efficient warriors to turn tables in humanitys everlasting struggle for intergalactic dominance.[CR]You take the role of one of those hybrids and learn first-hand what the war means for you and your kind. [CR]Gameplay:[CR]The game is divided into larger shooting and story parts. Still it's a very story-driven game but I tried to keep larger conversations out of the shooting segments.[CR]There is a lot of experimental stuff as well, like an ego shooter part but nothing too complicated. </plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Cadwyn[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] A visit to a friends house takes you down a difficult path. Made for the 2015 Write A Game jam. Thanks to my wife Sarah for providing the scenario and writing.[CR]You play the game as James, an ordinary boy who must battle unusual foes. But theres a catch to them... This is a short game, easily finished in 10 minutes or so, as per the contests rules. The game deals with issues like emotional abuse, fear of abandonment, and living with mental illness.[CR]In addition, there are two difficulties: Normal, and Difficult. Its recommended to play through the game on both difficulties at least once.[CR]Also, feel free to leave me feedback on what you think, either in a review or PM. [CR]This was my very first game ever completed, I had a lot of fun making it. :)</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Little Wing Guy[CR]Game Status: Production[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR]PLOT:[CR]Gabriel Landry is on the brink of re-discovering the lost art of White Magic. By simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Gordon Tullet, a young; yet talented Alchemist, learns the dark secrets and dangers behind White Magic. Framed for a crime he did not commit, he sets out to bring sense to the obsessive Gabriel.[CR]Although this is an honest effort, aiming to bring a complete RPG experience, the game uses mostly default systems, and is a relatively short and sweet fantasy JRPG. Set cliché to maximum setting! Full speed ahead, into that forest dungeon![CR]PROJECT INFO:[CR]The current game is approximately 1 hour in length, which is the entire first chapter, and about 20% of the full game. If the font is not showing correctly, please install MS Echoes which is included in the game folder.[CR]The demo may not be the longest one around, but since this is my first real release, I wanted to get a grasp on what I am doing right and wrong. The next demo, will be a more complete package. It will include a improved chapter one, and chapter two; which will be more focused on bringing a better experience, based on the feedback I have received. Thank you so much for reading/playing my game! [CR]I’m really open to advice, and critique about everything, so don't be shy, I promise I won't ever take offence!</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: dukester[CR]Game Status: Production[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] The story of Anastasia Rune Valeria, a side character from the game Wild Arms 2. In a world faced with annihilation by the hands of an ancient demonic entity, an ordinary girls unexpected bond with the reclusive deity of desire will set in motion a journey that will remain legend for thousands of years. With the help of Luther Bernadette, a ARMS marksman trained since childhood to prevent the return of the Metal Demons, Faust, an enigmatic sorcerer that knows the true origins of the demon Lord Blazer, and Marivel Armitage, an ageless technological genius, Anastasia will face the greatest scourge her world has ever known, and learn the tragic destiny of those who inherit the title of hero.[CR]I recently started reworking on it after a 7 year hiatus (I thought I lost the rpg to a virus before I changed computers, but found a old backup in oct 2015) and after extensive testing I finally uploaded what I worked on so far on dec 26 2015.[CR]The three beginning scenarios (one for each main character, each with a dungeon and boss) are 100% complete and theres a good 2 hours of gameplay ready so far. After the three scenarios are done, theres a epilogue that Wild Arms 2 fans can understand (since they already know the ending and how the memory maze works). What I plan to do in the future is bridge the story and gameplay gap in between, its a bit unorthodox. [CR]The trailer 7 years ago  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgCeyLXK00Y [CR]The new trailer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPRbJAMylHc [CR]Its not very impressive programming wise but I tried my best to edit the sprites and animations, and theres a lot of heart in the story and dialogue. Hope you can appreciate the polish and effort I put into it.</plot>

		<plot>Engine: RPG Maker 2003[CR]Author: Rastek[CR]Game Status: Completed[CR][B]Summary[/B][CR] Hey! This is my first completed project for rpgmaker2003, its a short non-linear exploration game. Even though it is non-linear, it does have an ending. The point of the game is about figuring whats going on. Its an exploration, but most of the discoveries will be about what happened to the protagonist. The aesthetic is based on old gameboy RPGs, this includes graphics, music and writting style. Its a short game. It really shouldnt take anyone more than an hour from start to finish. [CR] Most of the graphics and music were made by me, but there are some exeptions. Some tiles (flower tiles, all water tiles, dirt, walls) are from The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening, and others (seats, bookshelves) are from Pokemon Red. Not_home_anymore is similar in parts to a song from Digimon World 3, and Alone might be entirely plagarized from somewhere, though I cannot recall from where (If anyone knows, please leave a comment). All sound effects are from Links Awakening, except the stair climbing sound which is from A Link to the Past. They were all taken from HelpTheWretcheds website ( http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/  ).[CR] As far as difficulty goes, there are no fights, there is no way to lose, except to get stuck, of course. I would recommend the old strategy of talking to every NPC in case you do get stuck, though. I made a point of always making the NPC that gave the hint before the flower they hinted at. I Hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!</plot>

		<plot>Well ... again a fan-game of Zelda will you say to me. Yes, it is one. A basic fan-game, some spelling mistakes, chipsets badly adjusted at times (walk on water) but the game has an endearing je-ne-sais-quoi that pushes us to go further and further. Surely it was due to the atmosphere of the Zelda perfectly brushed on RPGMaker and the charasets custom drawn from Wind Waker very well done. This demo exploits the principle of bartering between villagers throughout the game while discovering the secrets and intimacy of each character. Frankly, this game surprised me.

Their only hope now is for RAD DOG, a crazy intergalactic hero, to help them...[CR]You control the ship of RAD DOG in the journey to eradicate the MAD CATS and to regain the lost bases.[CR]This game was made in one month for the Valedictory event. Its side scroller shmup with pixel movement and probably shares some similarity towards Gradius, Zero Wing and that lot, just with a few less projectiles due to this being rm2k3 after all.[CR]The game features 3 levels and about 20 different enemies and 5 kinds of power ups, with 1 of them being speed and the rest weapons, all which can be upgraded by gathering another power up of the same kind.[CR]Each level has about 3-5 minutes of gameplay if you dont die at any point during them. Since thats very unlikely to be happening (You will die) Id estimate there to be about 30 to 60 minutes worth of gameplay, which should be around the point where youve either beaten the game, or gotten pretty frustrated.[CR]Also a tiny warning. This being a rm2k3 game and all, and with this not being something the rm2k3 was made for, its quite possible you will experience some lag if your computer is of the older kind.[CR]The first level of the game</plot>
