You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game![CR]The 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well.

The league is scheduled to play on three courts: a street, a junkyard, and a rooftop.  The mayor figured that a friendly game of hoops would be a much more peaceful way to settle disputes. He was wrong.You can choose 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 game modes. There are six characters to choose from (ten in Atari Lynx version); each with their own health, speed, and power attributes. Each player without the ball can jump to block a shot or punch there opponent to get the ball. There's also an option to perform a power throw on an opposing player. Players with the ball can shoot or pass. Power ups appear on the court at random instances. These power up one attribute for the player. For example, the lightning power up increases the player's speed.

Each wrestler can kick, punch, and perform several moves such as the airplane spin, body slam, power lift, and more. Using the available moves you need to deplete your opponents energy  and pin him for three counts (though be careful, as some of the more powerful moves also use up a bit of your own energy). If your opponents energy is low enough and you successfully pin him that will count as a fall, and the best out of three falls will win the match! </plot>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<releasedate>1989</releasedate>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82997-title-match-pro-wrestling-atari-7800-screenshot-atari-logo.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82998-title-match-pro-wrestling-atari-7800-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82999-title-match-pro-wrestling-atari-7800-screenshot-select-the.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/83000-title-match-pro-wrestling-atari-7800-screenshot-beginning-a.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/83001-title-match-pro-wrestling-atari-7800-screenshot-oof-that-s.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/83002-title-match-pro-wrestling-atari-7800-screenshot-my-player-is.jpg</snapshot6>	</game>	<game name="Atari 7800 Symbolic Debug Monitor and Downloader (1988)(Atari)(NTSC)">		<rom name="Atari_7800_Symbolic_Debug_Monitor_and_Downloader_1988_Atari_NTSC/Atari_7800_Symbolic_Debug_Monitor_and_Downloader_1988_Atari_NTSC.a78" size="0"/>		<description>Atari 7800 Symbolic Debug Monitor and Downloader (1988)(Atari)(NTSC)</description>		<plot>Beef Drop is a port of the popular arcade game Burgertime, which Ken Siders first ported to the Atari 5200 and 8-bit computers.
