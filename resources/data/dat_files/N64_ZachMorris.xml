		<emu_comment>No Intro N64 list.  Filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR]Often referred to as N64, was Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit CPU, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is Nintendo's last home console to use ROM cartridges to store games (Nintendo switched to a MiniDVD-based format for the successor GameCube); handhelds in the Game Boy line, however, continued to use Game Paks. It was discontinued in 2001 in Japan, North America and PAL regions by the launch of Nintendo's GameCube.[CR]Developer:  Nintendo[CR]Manufacturer:  Nintendo[CR]CPU:  93.75 MHz NEC VR4300[CR]Memory:  4MB RDRAM[CR]Graphics:  62.5 MHz SGI RCP[CR]Sound:  48 kHz with 16-bit audio[CR]Display:  480i[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

		<plot>You are Bond. James Bond. You are assigned covert operations connected with the GoldenEye weapons satellite. M will brief you on your mission and objectives from London. Q Branch will support your efforts with a plentiful supply of weapons and gadgets. Moneypenny offers you light-hearted best wishes and you're off! Your mission begins in the heavily guarded chemical warfare facility at the Byelomorye Dam in the USSR. Look and shoot in any direction as you navigate 12 interactive 3-D environments. Use stealth and force as you see fit in matters of international security. Consider the military personnel expendable. You are licensed to kill![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu Codes[CR]Enter at the cheat menu, exit then return for the cheat to appear:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fire weapon in ending cutscene[CR]Before you complete a mission, set your control style to either 2.3 (Domino) or 2.4 (Goodhead), and equip the weapon you want to fire. If Bond is holding a weapon in the ending cutscene, you can fire the weapon and kill the people surrounding you by pressing Z on the 2nd controller.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 007 Mode[CR]To access 007 Mode, complete all missions on 00 Agent Mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Shoot hats[CR]Switch to any weapon (I suggest using a pistol).  Get a clear shot at an enemy's head.  Instead of shooting their head, shoot their hat.  It will fly off.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Beat Aztec quick and easy[CR]To complete Aztec, you normally need to beat Jaws, get the key card he drops, and head back across the level so that you can get into the locked room. To open this locked door without beating Jaws, simply stand at the glass door and shoot it to attract attention. When you see the door next to you start to open, run and hide behind one of the shelfs in the room. One of the guards should go to where you were standing, and open the door to go looking for you. Charge at him and get into the locked door before it closes.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Coming off the failure that was Tomorrow Never Dies, publisher EA wanted to return to James Bond's roots as a first-person shooter. The game, based on the film of the same name, had a different developer for each of the three platforms that it was released on. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom, the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops Entertainment, the developer of the previous James Bond game Tomorrow Never Dies, and by 2n Productions for the Game Boy Color. Versions of the game  for the PC and PlayStation 2 were planned for release but were later cancelled midway through the development cycle.[CR]The Nintendo 64 version of the game featured a multiplayer mode that was absent from the PlayStation version. The Nintendo 64 version also supported both Rumble Pak and Expansion Pack accessories. The game features 14 single player missions that follow the story of the film very closely. Just like GoldenEye 007, the game featured three difficulty levels: Agent, Secret Agent, and 00 Agent. Completing missions on a certain difficulty would allow you to unlock additional multiplayer maps such as a dark Eastern European forest, a version of MI6's Scotland Headquarters and ski resort complete with working gondolas, and an airplane. The PlayStation version is known for lacking three levels, a level of difficulty and multiplayer modes.[CR]The campaign contained multiple gadgets and numerous weapons the player could use. Each weapon had a second setting on it, such as the SA90, which could switch between single and burst modes of fire.[CR]The World is Not Enough contained a robust split-screen mode found in most James Bond games. Players could customize their experience in various ways. They could choose what weapons they wanted to be available ( sniper rifles, explosive weapons, close combat etc.), choose how they wanted their avatar to look while playing in the game, have either vertical or horizontal split-screen, and select score limit and match time. Players could fight in teams, Free-for-All, Last Man Standing, uplink, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. During the game, players could pick up various gadgets and aids such as body armor and night vision goggles.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Submachine GunsP90Ingalls Type 90Meyer TMPExplosive WeaponsGL40 Grenade LauncherSentinel Heat-Seeking Missile Launcher - Can fire in single or fully automatic modes.Frag GrenadeSticky GrenadeHandgunsRaptor Magnum - Includes optional laser sight.James Bond's classic Wolfer P2KAssault RiflesAK-47M4 Mustang - A variant of the M16.Meyer BullpupSniper RiflesSA90[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Jump From High Distances and Live[CR]If you want an advantage in this game then you need to use this trick. When you jump from a high distance, IE the top of a building in Skyrail, tap the Up-C button, or whatever button is your jump button, right before you hit the ground. You will hit the ground unharmed and be able to run away from people very easily.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Retro Skins[CR]Beat Meltdown on Agent to unlock these characters to play as in Multiplayer.

Mayday and Trevelyan have a new look in TWINE. Zorin was Mayday's boss in A View to a Kill, and Wai Lin is from Tomorrow Never Dies. She gave Bond his P2K.</plot>

		<title_clean>40 Winks</title_clean>
		<plot>40 Winks is a platform video game published in 1999 by Eurocom Entertainment Software and GT Interactive Software for the PlayStation video game console. The game is now avaliable on the Playstation Network.[CR][edit] Gameplay[CR]The player takes control of either Ruff or Tumble, a brother and sister who are sleeping and trying to free 40 "Winks" from a man named Nitekap and his accomplice, Threadbear. In the game's plot, "Winks" are small, white creatures which make dreams, and "Hoodwinks", which are green and of a similar size are what are responsible for nightmares.[CR]Throughout the game, the player can collect moon-shaped tokens, which are used to scream at dreamy apparitions, and Z-shaped tokens, which stop the player's character from waking up. Floating cogs are also collected to open doors. The character travels through dream worlds, such as haunted houses, ship wrecks, planets and prehistoric lands. The player can also transform into various types of beings.[CR]N64 Fail-[CR]A nearly-complete version was developed for the Nintendo 64, and even reviewed in Nintendo Official Magazine, but was cancelled due to the Nintendo 64's declining sales.[1] Ironically, print advertisements for the PlayStation version of the game came with a review quote stating "Move over, Mario...", supposedly from Nintendo Official Magazine.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Aerofighters Assualt is the fourth and last game in the                      Aero Fighters franchise. Rather than being a       top down shoot 'em up like it's predecessors, Aerofighters Assault takes advantage of the Nintendo    Comparison of the US/EU and JP title screens      64's capabilities by becoming a                   3D air combat series similar to               Ace Combat. Players are able to choose from six (two of which are unlockable) aircraft, each with unique special weapons. Although    modeled and named after actual jets, the planes in Aerofighters Assault handle in an arcade like fashion, carry payloads in impossible quantities, and use fantastical special weapons.     [CR]Controls [CR]The aircraft in Aerofighters Assault control in an arcade fashion, where stalls are non existent. The analog stick controls pitch, with up and down inverted as they would be on a jets joystick. Afterburners are mapped to the up C button, increasing speed, and the air-brake is mapped to the down C button, decreasing speed. Players can control yaw with the left and right C buttons, controlling their respective directions. As for armaments, the Z button is used to fire each planes primary machine gun, A fires the players primary missile attack, and B activates the defensive chaff. When available, each jets special weapon may be fired with the R button. The D-pad can be used to view camera angles around the players aircraft.

		<plot>Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage follows the story of Alaron, poisoned by mysterious goblins while out on patrol in the grounds of King Loyd's kingdom. Without a common cure, Alaron must set out on a journey with a selection of companions in search of the antidote. Little does Alaron know that the journey is even more dangerous then first thought, with a mysterious evil force brewing in the distance.[CR]A 3D fantasy role playing game, you must complete a set of quests, through the use of items and magic, while following a slightly non-linear storyline, in which you choose in what order the tasks can be completed. The game features two distinctive different modes: exploring and fighting. Alaron explores the game world freely, discover special places and talk to its inhabitants. There are no random encounters but if he meets an enemy the game switches to the combat screen. Combat is basically turn based but not in the usual console RPG way: during a character's turn he can be moved in real-time in a circular way - the characters move constantly towards each other. When two rings intersect the characters can launch a regular or magic attack. The party selection (up to four characters) is pre-defined by the story.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extended Ending[CR]At the ending, if you have any character from the beginning of the game in your party (Abrecan, Brenna, and/or Rheda), then the king will have an additional scene for each character. If you have any other character, then no additional scenes will be shown.</plot>

		<plot>Air Boarder is a game that resembles skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater but with a certain aspect of it being quite different. Instead of the usual skateboards the game features hoover boards.[CR]1 Player option features the following modes:[CR]1. Lecture  mode where you can learn the controls and the terms the game uses.[CR]2. Street Work  the main mode of the game. At the beginning there are 4 available characters (total of 8), 5 stages and 4 boards (total of 12) from which you can choose. At each stage you are given a time limit in which you must perform as many tricks as possible with your board. There are also yellow circles lying around that you must pass through. Each time you pass through one the timer resets back and if you pass through all the game ends regardless of how much time is left. When the game ends you get a rank depending on the points you accumulated and if the rank is high enough a level of higher difficulty is unlocked (with a total of 3 difficulty levels per stage).[CR]3. Time Attack  you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within the least time possible. The spots where the circles are can be seen via a map that appears on the screen.[CR]4. Coin  mode in which you must get all the coins that are scattered on each stage within the time limit.[CR]5. Free Run  this mode is free of challenges (no time limit or points) and mostly serves as a means of getting you acquainted with each stage.[CR]2 Players option features the following modes:[CR]1. Vs. Race  2 Player race where the one that passes through all of the yellow circles, in the order that is specified wins.[CR]6. Vs. Coin  another 2 Player mode where the player who gets all the coins or has the most when the time limit ends wins.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boards[CR]Complete the following to open up bonus characters:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get S Ranking[CR]To get the S ranking, score over 40,000 points in Street Work mode. </plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. is based on the Armorines comic book, where armored marines fight aliens in the name of the United States government. You do much of the same in the game, but the enemies strike little resemblance to those in the comic. The Spider Aliens of the comic book are slightly humanoid, while those found in the game resemble over-sized bugs. You must save Earth from invading enemies, much like in the movie Starship Troopers released a couple of years earlier.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Screenshot[CR]It's a first-person shooter where each mission is objective-based. There are five environments, both on Earth and in space. Several game segments are on-rails. Player are ranked in a points system and promoted when due. There are two Armorines available for play, one slow and strong and one fast and adequate in strength. Two-player co-op and standard four-player Deathmatch are supported.[CR]The game uses Acclaim's Turok 2 engine. By using a Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, the Nintendo 64 version can output in hi-res (640 x 480). The game had no analog support on the PlayStation version, making the control schemes difficult to use.[CR]On the GameBoy Color version, you play as a single marine with five weapons to choose from. There are six levels and seven kinds of enemies.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Gunnery Sergent Harold "Gunny" Lewis[CR]Lieutenant Myra Lane[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Although sharing the same engine as the successful Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game did not fare well among videogame critics. IGN wrote that "Armorines is a Starship Troopers add-on to the Turok 2 engine. Nothing more." The GameBoy Color version generally received higher scores than the console versions. The Nintendo 64 version generally received higher scores than the PlayStation version; GameSpot wrote that discussing all the bad things about the PlayStation version "would be like flogging a dead horse" and that "elements that were bland and boring in the Nintendo 64 version are downright offensive here."[CR]A sequel for the game was planned, but then cancelled after the game's poor reception.[CR]Prequel Comic[CR]A four issue mini-series was released by Acclaim Comics prior to the games release. Due to low sales, these issues are hard to find, particualarly the final issue (featuring the X-O Manowar).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Co-op level codes[CR]The password screen is on the main menu where it says "Password"</plot>

		<plot>Crave Entertainment has given us an Asteroids game for the 90s, beefing up the classic formula with updated graphics and numerous multiplayer modes. Asteroids Hyper 64 contains 50 levels spread out over five zones. Although the time-tested concept remains the same (blast everything on the screen), players are armed with new power-ups and have to defeat a boss at the end of each level. Multiplayer action includes both cooperative and competitive variations, including team play.</plot>

Great graphics effects, including light flares on your windshield, will take your breath away. But it's the goods under the hood that will have speed freaks salivating.[CR][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are 4 modes of play: Championship, Single Race, Arcade and Time Trial. In a race, if the players' cars run out of fuel or have their tires worn down, they are urged to take a pit stop where they engage in a brief minigame. Automobili Lamborghini featured eight cars that resembled actual supercars. These resembled cars such as the Porsche 959, Ferrari F50, Ferrari Testarossa, Dodge Viper, the McLaren F1, and the Bugatti EB110, that could be unlocked by winning championships. These were joined by the two default cars, which resembled the Lamborghini Countach and Lamborghini Diablo. In what could be considered a landmark, Automobili Lamborghini was one of the first console games to allow both four player and AI opponents simultaneously.[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobili_Lamborghini[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/196671-automobili-lamborghini[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock All Cars[CR]At the title screen, enter this code:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reverse Tracks[CR]Just win the following to get the car that you want:</plot>

		<plot>Two years after Banjo Kazooie, Banjo and the gang are playing cards when an earthquake happens. Eagerly Mumbo goes out to investigate. He sees two hideous witches reviving Grunty. Mumbo goes back to investigate. Grunty shoots a laser beam at Banjo's house. Mumbo warns everyone but Bottles doesn't belive him. Grunty blows up Banjo's house with Bottles inside and sets off to get her body back. Motivated by revenge Banjo sets out to stop Grunty and revive Bottles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheato Codes[CR]You must type in the word ''CHEATO'' before all of these codes.  To get them without collecting the pages first, type in ''CHEATO'' followed by spelling the code backwards [CR]* You can get this from Madame Grunty's fortune telling tent in Witchyworld, but the probabilities of it coming up are very low.  Just enter the code to get it if you grow impatient with entering the tent over and over again. You must, however, spell it backwards. (CHEATOYGGIJTEG)[CR]** Look behind Master Jiggywiggy in his temple and answer the riddle to access this cheat, or just type in the code backwards to get it. (CHEATOGNIKTSEN)[CR]*** After finding the two secret eggs (Blue, Pink) and returning them to Heggy, you'll gain this code.  If you don't want to find the eggs first, just type the code in backwards. (CHEATOGNIMOH)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Banjos Double Jump[CR]When Banjo is by himself and has the Pack Whack, jump in the air and press B to use the move. Quickly after pressing B, jump again, and Banjo will perform a double jump. This is useful for reaching Taxi Pack easily and also for navigating the boxes in Grunty Idustries. It won't save you from high falls though, even if you use it before hitting the ground--but it is fun to watch Banjo get hurt from a seemingly short hop.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Character Parade[CR]Beat the game 100% to unlock the Character Parade movie in Replay Mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Rares Mr. Pants Cameo[CR]Once you have gotten Hailfire Peaks unlocked, go to the ice side of it. Search around until you see Boggy's hut (it's a giant igloo). Go inside and look at the TV that Boggy is sitting in front of. You should see this white man with a hat and nothing but pants on. This is Mr. Pants, by Rareware.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Jinjos as Playable Characters (Multi-player)[CR]Once you've learned the Split Up, Bill Drill and Hatch abilities, make your way to the Wooded Hollow.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title Screen for Banjo-Kazooie on the N64[CR]Banjo-Kazooie is a platformer developed by Rare who was heavily influenced by Super Mario 64. In the game, players play as a bear named Banjo who wears a backpack containing his bird-friend - Kazooie. The game features large worlds full of collectibles, secrets, and enemies.[CR]Throughout his journey, Banjo and Kazooie must collect notes, new powers, and jiggys to advance to the next level. Also, the game features a very distinct soundtrack that features heavy use of a banjo.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Banjo-Kazooie begins with a wicked witch named Gruntilda stirring a green liquid in her cauldron called Dingpot. She claims to be the most beautiful woman, until Dingpot explains how she is not, and that Tooty (Banjo's sister) is the prettiest girl ever. Gruntilda, who is always speaking in rhymes, explains how she will capture Tooty.[CR]She is successful and threatens to switch appearances with Tooty, when Banjo hears of what happened. From then on it is Banjo's duty to stop Gruntilda, with his bird-friend Kazooie, by going to different worlds, collecting tons of items, and eventually confronting Gruntilda herself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Snow Areas.[CR]Banjo-Kazooie follows a structure similar to that of Super Mario 64. Players are tasked with finding various collectible objects such Jiggys (Jigsaw Pieces), Musical Notes, and Mumbo Tokens and then using those objects to traverse through the hub-world. Jigsaw pieces open doors to new worlds by collecting enough to complete the corresponding jigsaw puzzle.[CR]There are ten Jiggies in each world: nine must be found, and one is granted by finding all five Jinjos on each world. Musical Notes open magic note doors that allow Banjo and Kazooie to progress further into Gruntilda's lair. There are 100 notes in each world, and 900 total in the game. Mumbo Tokens grant the player magical transformations at Mumbo's hut when the player collects a sufficient amount. These transformations include the following: termite, crocodile, walrus, pumpkin and bee.[CR]On the way, players will meet many characters, but the one who will help players the most is Mumbo - A skull-man who is able to cast magic. He helps Banjo on his quest by opening secret doors and stopping trains. Banjo travels along with his bird companion, Kazooie; she allows him to fly, climb, and she can turn into an egg-firing machine gun.[CR]Together they are bound to take down the evil Gruntilda - An evil witch who wants to control the world and commit evil deeds. She resides in her lair, with her trusty troll like companion.[CR]If a player receives a game over, a cut scene is show of Gruntilda successfully switching appearances with Tooty and becoming a beautiful witch, then mocking Banjo as the screen fades out.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Banjo the BearBanjoOne of the two protagonists of the game, Banjo is a quirky Honey Bear trying to rescue his younger sister, Tooty. He lives in a small blue house in Spiral Mountain with his sister Tooty and friend Kazooie, and is easily recognized by his sharktooth necklace, blue backpack and bright yellow shorts.Kazooie the BreegullKazooieA red-crested Breegull, Kazooie is the sassy counterpart to Banjo's light and cheerful demeanor. She stays in Banjo's blue backpack and helps Banjo to perform a large variety of moves with the help of Bottles' training, including running up steep, slippery slopes, flying and shooting eggs at the bad guys.Gruntilda WinkybunionGruntildaBanjo-Kazooie's antagonist, Gruntilda is an ugly witch obsessed with her looks. She captured Banjo's sister Tooty and plans to use a machine to steal young Tooty's good looks. Gruntilda, or Grunty for short, always speaks in rhyme during the course of the game.Tooty the BearTooty[CR]Banjo's younger sister who is captured by Gruntilda. Tooty has not appeared in a game since Banjo-Kazooie, although Rare has made references to her in Banjo-Tooie and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts.[CR]Originally Tooty was going to be Banjo's girlfriend named "Piccolo".Bottles the MoleBottlesA nerdy looking mole constantly pestered by Kazooie, Bottles teaches Banjo and Kazooie all of the moves in the game. He is easily identified by his plaid suit and coke-bottle glasses, and upon reaching one of his molehills hidden within each of the various levels within the game, the player will be able to learn a new technique from the mole himself.Mumbo JumboBrentilda WinkybunionKlungoKlungoThe lumbering, green, humpbacked sidekick to Gruntilda the witch. In Banjo-Kazooie he can only be seen in a few cutscenes where he operates Gruntilda's beauty machine or is just trying to help his master.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Mumbo Mountain- First level is like a jungle filled with orange throwing gorillas, a termite cave, and a bull just waiting to trample Banjo and Kazooie. Banjo can visit Mumbo and transform into a termite.Treasure Trove Cove- An island which contains many pinching crabs, a giant hermit crab, a pirate who lost his treasure, and a seemingly indestructible shark. This level also contains a stranded ship and a light house perched on an arch.Clanker's Cavern- A sewer like water filled level that contains a metal shark named Clanker that is Gruntilda's Garbage disposal, that is looking to be unchained.Bubblegloop Swamp- a swamp that is home to a giant turtle, a large crocodile, musical frogs, a corcadile hungry for worms, and many hidden poisonous frogs waiting to pounce on Banjo. Mumbo can turn Banjo into a crocodile.Freezeezy Peak- A snowy village with a giant snowman in the middle there are many evil snowman throwing snowballs, but there is also a Christmas tree , and three kids whose dad, Boggy, is missing. Mumbo can turn Banjo into a Walrus.Gobi's Valley- An desert with many ancient Egyptian pyramids and a sphinx. There are many mummies to haunt Banjo, also there is a very thirsty tree and a camel named Gobi.Mad Monster Mansion- A haunted house and grounds with many skeletons and bats to pester Banjo. Also there is a Organ playing hand and a toilet named Loggo. Mumbo can change Banjo into a pumpkin.Rusty Bucket Bay- A giant ship docked in polluted waters. This ship has a captain seeking the assistance of Banjo and Kazooie.Click Clock Wood- The final level is a wooded area that can experience seasonal changes. Mumbo can also change Banjo into a bee in this area.[CR]Speech[CR]A large feature of gameplay is that the characters make limited speech-like sounds when they talk. The voices are not real speech, but rather a looping of voice-like sounds when text bubbles were displayed.[CR]This artistic choice was likely made due to memory limitations on Nintendo 64 cartridges; however, this added considerably to the atmosphere and uniqueness of the game. The gibberish like speech would go on to become a staple of the series to the point where when the series moved over to the Xbox 360 (a system more than capable of handling speech) with Banjo and Kazooie Nuts and Bolts the team opted to stick with gibberish.[CR]In addition this manner of speech has influenced many a games. Rare themselves re-used the trope in Grabbed by the Ghoulies.[CR]Stop 'N' Swop[CR]Stop 'N' Swop is an incomplete feature in Banjo-Kazooie. During development of the game, the team at Rare learned that if the N64 cartridge was pulled out without shutting off the power, the game would retain memory for a few seconds. The team intended to incorporate this "feature" into the game proving a hook for the game's sequel. After collecting 100 Jiggies, Mumbo shows Banjo and Kazooie a movie showing the duo reaching inaccessible areas saying that this will be poossible in the sequel Banjo-Tooie. At first it was unknown how this games would could connect, but eventually hackers discovered menu titled "Stop 'N' Swop" in the game code that would of allowed Banjo to get these items. Shortly after the game was released, Nintendo released a newer model N64 that significantly shortened the length of time a cart-less N65 could hold data. Rare conceded and the Stop N Swap feature was canned, only to be resurrected nearly ten years later.[CR]In January 2009, Banjo-Tooie was announced for the Xbox Live Arcade , together with the return of the Stop 'n' Swop link between the two original games to unlock hidden material in Banjo-Tooie.[CR]On the XBLA version of the game, 6 special Stop 'N' Swop eggs can be found without the use of cheats. The egg locations are as follows:-Pink Egg- In Treasure Trove Cove. There will be an island called Sharkfood Island. Inside it is a mountain on top of which is the pink egg.-Cyan Egg- Mad Monster Mansion. In the cellar one barrel will have the Cyan egg deep inside it.-Green Egg- Mad Monster Mansion. In the bathroom the Green egg will be on top of Loggo.-Blue Egg- Gobi's Valley. One of the magic carpets will take Banjo to the location of Gobi before he leaves the desert. In the building will be a sarcophagus containing the Blue Egg.-Red Egg- Rusty Bucket Bay. In the captain's quarters through one of the portholes will have the red egg.-Yellow Egg- Click Clock Wood. In the Winter season, in Nabnut the squirrel's house will hold the yellow egg.[CR]There is also an ice key that can be found In Freezeezy Peak in Wozza the Walrus' cave.[CR]Other Changes Prior To Release[CR]The Old Logo.[CR]Between its release and being first announced at E3 in 1997, the game underwent a number of significant changes. At the time, the title "Dream", was simply derived from Rare's codename for the game "Project: Dream". Kazooie was originally named Kazoo, however her name had already been copyrighted, leading to the renaming of the character and the game's subsequent title. The first logo that was revealed also differs greatly from the current one.[CR]Banjo-Kazooie was meant to have 16 levels, however some were cut in order to meet the game's release schedule. These included Mount Fire Eyes, which eventually ended up as the lava side of Hailfire Peaks in Banjo-Tooie, and Fungus Forest, which became Fungi Forest in Donkey Kong 64 and was the area depicted on the game's Box Art. Although rumors have circulated regarding a Hammerhead Beach level, this was only the beta name for the beach level which ended up being called Treasure Trove Cove. A mine and circus level were also originally planned for the game, but were scrapped and used in the game's sequel instead.[CR]As well as the Stop 'n' Swop feature with Banjo-Tooie, there was also a rumored link up to Donkey Kong 64 that never came to fruition. Although the feature was never used in Banjo-Tooie, two hackers of the Rare Witch Project uncovered the codes to unlock the obtainable items by entering the codes in the Treasure Trove Cove sandcastle area after entering the word "CHEAT". They were posted shortly after Banjo-Tooie's release in 2001. Those codes are as follows:[CR]A DESERT DOOR OPENS WIDE ANCIENT SECRETS WAIT INSIDE (Gobi's Valley)[CR]OUT OF THE SEA IT RISES TO REVEAL MORE SECRET PRIZES (Treasure Trove Cove)[CR]NOW YOU CAN SEE A NICE ICE KEY WHICH YOU CAN HAVE FOR FREE (Freezeezy Peaks)[CR]AMIDST THE HAUNTED GLOOM A SECRET IN THE BATHROOM (Mad Monster Mansion)[CR]DONT YOU GO AND TELL HER ABOUT THE SECRET IN HER CELLAR (Mad Monster Mansion)[CR]THIS SECRET YOULL BE GRABBIN IN THE CAPTAINS CABIN (Rusty Bucket Bay)[CR]NOW BANJO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT ON NABNUTS TABLE (Click Clock Wood)[CR]Several other small elements were excluded from the final game, including things on a level-by-level basis. For instance, Mad Monster Mansion had a flight pad at one point[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack, consisting of music from the game composed by Grant Kirkhope, was released by Nintendo of America on a limited edition CD. This CD was sold exclusively at Best Buy stores and the Nintendo Power Catalog with two additional tracks.Disc 1Banjo-Kazooie Soundtrack (Backside)Main TitleSpiral MountainWitch's LairMumbo's MountainTreasure Trove CoveClanker's CavernBubble Gloop SwampFreezeezy PeakGobi's ValleyMad Monster MansionRusty Bucket BayClick Clock WoodQuizCreditsFinal BattleBanjo OvertureSquirrel (Nabnut's house in Click Clock Wood)[CR]XBLA Version[CR]The XBLA version was made available to everyone on November 26 2008 for the price of 1200 Microsoft Points ($15). A free download code for the game was given to some of the people who pre-ordered Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts giving them the opportunity to play the original 2 weeks before anyone else.[CR]The gameplay is the same as the N64 original, but the graphics have been improved to support 1080p (the 2D sprites showing the most improvement). In addition, the stop 'n swop items can be legitimately obtained with a Nuts and Bolts save file. They can be used to unlock special parts (i.e. British Flags, Fuzzy Dice, Potted Plant, etc.) in said game, although they are for decoration more than anything else.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bottles Bonuses[CR] After you complete the ''Puzzle Game'' code go to the castle in Treasure Trove Cove.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title Screen[CR]Banjo-Tooie is a 3D platforming adventure game developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, and later ported to Xbox Live Arcade. It is the sequel to 1998's Banjo-Kazooie. The game stars the famous bear and bird duo, Banjo and Kazooie, and is set two years after the events of Banjo-Kazooie. The game started development before the release of Banjo-Kazooie, and was released on November 1, 2000.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]King Jingaling and Jinjos[CR]Two years after the events of Banjo-Kazooie, Grunty was still stuck under the rock with Klungo still pushing it. One stormy night, while Banjo, Kazooie, Bottles, and Mumbo are playing cards in Banjo's House, a giant drill machine known as the Hag 1 drills out of a wall into Spiral Mountain. The rumbling of the machines caused Banjo and company to become worried. Unbeknownst to them, two witch sisters arrive and easily move the boulder that Gruntilda was trapped under in the last game. They send Mumbo out into the stormy night. He walks over to a nearby bush and sees Gruntilda She is no longer just an ugly witch, but a bony and uglier witch. After casting a bony eye on Spiral Mountain, she spies Mumbo and runs after him, magic blazing. He warns the others, who escape, but Bottles decides it's a trick, and gets caught in a blast. Banjo's house is destroyed, Bottles is dead, and the world is at risk. Grunty and her sisters then retreat to the Cauldron Keep in the Hag 1 drilling machine, scattering all of the jinjo families in the process.[CR]Banjo and Kazooie survey the wreckage, then decide it's time for another adventure. Along the way, they encounter many challenges, fearsome enemies, and a witch that is out for revenge. Nothing that a bear and a bird can't handle.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Banjo in Jolly Roger's Lagoon[CR]Banjo-Tooie's gameplay is similar in concept to its predecessor, Banjo-Kazooie. The player must explore the hub world (Isle O' Hags) and enter nine large non-linear levels, each containing Jiggies which allow further access to the Isle. The core goal of the game is the same as the first, to collect as many jiggies as possible. There are a wide variety of puzzles, games, platforming and adventures that will net jiggies. Collecting them will afford access to new levels. All in all there are 90, with the player often needing to revisit levels with new moves in order to collect them. There are also other collectibles, such as musical notes and jinjos. The levels available run the gamut, from an ancient civilization to an underwear factory.[CR]Once again unlocking levels requires completing puzzles; however, this time the pictures are all based in one fixed point, Jiggywiggy's Temple. Also returning from the previous game is the ability to transform, allowing access to different areas, as well as the ability to learn new moves. Banjo and Kazooie start out with all the abilities they learned in the previous game. This is in contrast to the common "lose moves" scenario that some sequels take. They are able to jump, flip, swim, attack, and even fly (with the help of flying pads). They can also learn new moves from Bottles' brother Jamjars. However, this process has been altered from the previous installment. Whereas in Banjo-Kazooie, new moves had been free to learn whenever the player had located Bottles' Molehill, the new instructor Jamjars requires Musical Notes to learn new abilities. One of these new moves is the Split Up, which allows Banjo and Kazooie to, as the name suggests, go their separate ways and explore on their own. When doing so, the characters have different characteristics and new abilities. Kazooie is fast, can fly and hatch eggs but has one honeycomb health less than Banjo, whereas Banjo is slower, but has more health and can perform different abilities with his backpack. Another new staple is the addition of Mumbo Jumbo as a playable character. Mumbo can perform spells which can lead to a Jiggy or aid gameplay.[CR]The game is also groundbreaking in several areas, the biggest of these being level design and connection. Platformers before it typically had their levels linked only by a single hub world or overworld. In Banjo-Tooie however, most of the levels are interconnected in various ways. While there is still a hub world, players are able to cross between worlds themsevs, such as between Glitter Gulch Mine and Jolly Roger's Lagoon via water pipes, or between Terrydactyland and Witchyworld to grab some hamburgers. For certain jiggies cross travel is required. The biggest implementation of this is the train stations. There are train stations in most of the levels, which allow the player to hop on the train in one level, and choose which level to get off at (providing the player has found the station in that level first).[CR]Multiplayer and Extras[CR]There are a variety of things outside the single player adventure that are unlocked as it progresses.Multiplayer[CR]Multiplayer consists of all the various mini-games that are played throughout the game, such as the Mayahem Kickball Tournament. Games such as the Ordnance Shootout and Chomper's Belly put the player in First-Person, with Kazooie acting as a gun (and firing eggs) to either kill players or hit targets. Other games play as they would normally, with human players in for computers.Replays[CR]The game records all of the mini-games, boss battles, and cutscenes that the player has gone through. They can then replay any of these standalone items at any time.CharactersBanjo the BearBanjo ("Yea-huh!")Back for another adventure, Banjo is one of the main characters of the game. He is a brown bear with a penchant for helping people out. He wears his trademark yellow shorts, shark tooth necklace, and blue backpack. He was a bit oafish and slow to pick up on things in the first game, but nowadays he's shown flashes of a newfound wit...Kazooie the BreegullKazooie (*facepalm*)The other central character of the series, Kazooie is a foul-mouthed breegull. Quick to judge, she is seen at the beginning robbing the poker players blind. She resides in Banjo's backpack, often coming out just to peck, drill, or demean. In this game though, she may have found a bit of compassion, as well as a way out of the backpack...Gruntilda WinkybunionGruntilda the skeleton witch (*Evil laugh*)The series' main antagonist is at it again. After being freed from her rock, Grunty is now a very bony witch. She is heavyset, and has a hatred for the bear and bird. The quest will be to stop her destruction of the world.Mumbo JumboMumbo the Shaman skull-guyReturning from the last adventure, Mumbo has been stripped of his transformation powers by an unknown force. Now though, he gets the chance to come out of the skull. He is a shaman, complete with a bony head, and skull staff (and house). Players can control him by bringing him a glowbo. He has a staff attack, as well as the ability to perform magic at Mumbo Pads, pads with his face on it.Humba WumbaWumbaMaking her debut in the series is Humba Wumba, a Native American shaman and rival to Mumbo Jumbo. She takes on his old role, transforming Banjo and Kazooie into various objects and animals. She needs to be given a Glowbo for her magic to work, but it is only needed once. Her transformations are valuable to solving the worlds many puzzles.Bottles the MoleBottles the Mole (deceased)The teacher of moves from the first game, Bottles is back, albeit in another form. Killed in the beginning by Gruntilda's magic, he is only seen as a ghost in Spiral Mountain. He may have hope yet.....Drill Sergent JamjarsJamjars the military moleA military mole who teaches Banjo the most important moves of the game, Jamjars is the brother of Bottles the mole. He is strict, making Banjo bring him musical notes in exchange for moves. He shows little emotion, even when hitting his head on his silo. Still, his moves are the best.KlungoKlungo the henchmanGrunty's faithful sidekick, Klungo has been trying to move that rock for years. He will fight for her numerous times, though he may not like it...Mingella WinkybunionMingella and her spellbookOne of Gruntilda's sisters, she and Blobbelda build the Big-O-Baster (B.O.B.). She also used her spellbook to removed the rock that was on-top of Gruntilda.Blobbelda WhinkybunionBlobbelda and her unnamed catGruntilda's sister, she and Mingella build B.O.B.Master JiggywiggyJiggywiggy the jiggies masterA man with a puzzle piece for a head, he helps Banjo open doors to new worlds. It is not known how he eats, or breathes.King JingalingKing Jingaling with his pet TootsThe first real help in the game comes from the great King. Unfortunately, he is a target soon after.WorldsMayhem TempleThe Targitzan's Temple in Mayhem TempleA temple that is the lair of an evil god sitting at the top of a big mountain surrounded by lush caves, and other smaller temples, which house angry native beasts and booby traps. Banjo will even find a stadium where rock beings play a strange version of soccer.Glitter Gulch MineInside of Glitter Gulch MineAn old diamond mine where big piles of precious stone can be found close to a river that crosses the entire world. This world also features a railroad, a prospector who lost his beloved puppy, caves ridden with poisonous gas and the train which Banjo will use to travel more quickly to other the worlds of the game.WitchyworldWitchyworld entryGruntilda&#8217;s amusement park has lots of rather strange and dangerous rides. This world has lots of different mini-games and some nice classic platforming challenges. In the middle of this freaky park lies a big circus tent home to a giant talking dinosaur balloon. Banjo can also find stands to buy hamburgers and French fries that will eventually be used to solve hunger problems from other worlds.Jolly Roger's LagoonJolly Roger's Lagoon entryMost of this level takes place underwater but the characters don&#8217;t need to worry about drowning since Mumbo will allow them to breathe underwater. Banjo will find a mysterious sunken city, a scary violent fish and beautiful underwater scenarios. Close to the lagoon there are many shops and a bar owned by a quirky frog that is worried about his odd girlfriend where an old drunk pirate hides one of the game&#8217;s most famous secrets.TerrydactylandTerrydactyland entryA world with lots of dinosaurs, many of which want to eat Banjo and Kazooie while some need their aid to solve their problems. There is also an ancient tribe with a major nourishment problem. On the center of the world there is a enormous mountain where the duo will come across a female pterodactyl that has problems hatching their eggs.Grunty IndustriesGrunty Industries entry with a Jinjio on top ("Help!")A big industry with six different floors that looks like an impressive fortress. The place has lots of machines and piles of boxes, it is the biggest level of the entire game. Finding a way in may be as confusing as navigating through all those floors using service elevators. Here Banjo and Kazooie will need to help the employees wash their clothes and they will even visit a famous talking toilet that appeared on the previous game.Hailfire PeaksHailfire Peaks entryA big mountain divided between an ice land and a hot inferno. The place is ruled by two twin dragons that will attack Banjo and Kazooie with fire or ice balls as they enter their domains. On the fire side of the mountain the duo will need to defend the soccer title that they got when visiting Mayahem Temple, while on the ice mountain Banjo will visit a beautiful ice cave and deal with lots of yetis.Cloud CuckoolandCloud Cuckooland entryA sky world with a very big group of floating isles to be explored. At the center of the world there is a large honey hive, filled with bizarre-looking monsters.

While in Banjo-Kazooie only a few stages featured transformations on Banjo-Tooie all of the worlds have their own specific transformations. They are listed below, including the location where it happens and a brief description.TransformationLocationDescription and AbilitiesAdditional NotesDragonIsle O' HagsTurns Kazooie in a fire-breathing dragon.Retains most learned moves, but pecking replaced with fire breathing.Requires Mega Glowbo from Ice Key vault.StonyMayahem TempleTurns Banjo into a Stoney; a sentient race of stone statues.Uses a barge attack.Ability to communicate with other Stonies.Allows Banjo to compete in Kickball minigames.This form can also travel to the Lava side of Hailfire Peaks.DetonatorGlitter Gulch MineTurns Banjo into a dynamite plunger.Can perform an explosion attack, which takes off one health for each use.Can clear paths to new areas of the map.VanWitchyworldTurns Banjo into an armored van.Allows access to new rides and areas.Can run over enemies.Imperious to all damage.SubmarineJolly Roger's LagoonTurns Banjo into a submarine.Fires torpedos and sonar.Due to the environment, movement requires a special control scheme.

BeeCloud CuckoolandTurns Banjo into a bumblebee.Allows Banjo to fly without Kazooie or Red Feathers.Fires a stinger projectile.Returning form from Banjo-Kazooie[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]BossLocation(s)DescriptionTacticsKlungoSpiral Mountain, Isle o' Hags, Cauldron KeepGruntilda`s most loyal servant attacks Banjo with a bunch of potions that have varied effects.Klungo has three different kinds of potions that he acquires in a random order throughout the game. When he drinks them, they provide the opportunity to attack him.The three potions are:Invisibility- Klungo becomes temporarily invisible, but the potions does not work as effectively as it should, and the player can easily spot him when the potion fades.Growth- Klungo grows to about 2x his size, all the duo has to do is avoid his attacks and strike when his guard is downClones- Spawns an increasing amount of clones, attack all of them while trying to find the real one.After hitting Klungo, a force field envelops him and he begins throwing exploding potions at Banjo, just dodge the potions until the force field disperses and he'll drink another one of his potions and the player can return to attacking him.Upon three strikes, he is defeated. He is fought multiple times throughout the game as a mini boss.TargitzanMayahem TempleA rock, and wooden, totem pole. He is fought entirely in first-person mode.The player will be in first-person mode in this battle. All they need to do is aim for the holes each layer of this totem pole and that layer will collapse. They need to be careful however, of the dart projectiles that come out of some holes and dodge them while aiming. Once he's down to just his head, he will self-destruct and Banjo will get the Jiggy.Old King CoalGlitter Gulch MineA gigantic coal golem who lives in the boiler of his steam train; Chuffy.The easiest way to do this is to get on a floating platform then aim at King Coal with Kazooie. Eventually a chunk of his body will fall off and he will get faster, just keep firing at him and he will lose more chunks and give up.Upon defeat, Banjo is not only awarded with a Jiggy but also with Chuffy; which can be used to travel between worlds with train stations.Mr. PatchWitchyworldA giant inflatable dinosaur covered in a variety of patches.First, equip the Grenade Eggs, then aim at one of Patch's patches (big stunner here). He will realize what Banjo did and summon a boxing glove that will pop out of the ground and attack him. So to counter this, the duo must use the flight pads that he also summons to attack him in the air with their new "Aim in the Air" technique. Just aim for all 12 patches while dodging his beach ball attack, and he will go down for the count (no boxing pun intended).NOTE: It is safe to touch Mr. Patch, so use this advantage.Lord Woo Fak FakJolly Roger's LagoonA gigantic anglerfish who resides inside the small, but surprisingly spacious, Davy Jone's LockerA lot like Mr. Patch's fight, only underwater. Woo Fak Fak will swim back and forth across the arena, stop, and send a charge of energy toward Banjo, just swim up or down to dodge it. To attack him aim for whichever boil on the Lord's body is glowing, it will pop and he will get angry.After getting rid of 6 boils, he will open his eyes. Now that his eyes are open, he will fire the energy charges more frequently and more accurately, dodge them while aiming for his eyes and he will be defeated.TerryTerrydactylandAn imposing male pterodactyl, as well as an overly-protective parent.Terry will fly around the nest and stop at each end and shoot mucus at Banjo. Shoot Terry while he is flying around the nest to hurt him. After awhile, he will send out some nostril minions to attack Banjo, defeat them, and return to shooting the pterodactyl and he will eventually cave, giving him a Jiggy.When defeated, Terry asks the duo to find his missing babies; which was the reason for his anger.WeldarGrunty IndustriesAn enormous welding torch with a habit of giving away too much information.This boss has 3 basic patterns: Blue flames, Minions, and Chasing. The first one has Banjo dodge some flames that Weldar spits from his mouth. After that is done, he will try to suck him up like vacuum. Simply shoot a flaming egg (fire, grenade, clock-work Kazooie) into his mouth and a red plate will fall off of his body. He will get mad and send minions after Banjo, defeat them and he will try to suck the duo up again, shoot an egg and another plate flies off. Now he jumps up into the air and then chases the duo around the battle field like it's a deadly version of "Tag". He will try to suck them up, so shoot another egg into his mouth.Soon after, he turns on an electrical switch that turns on cables in the ground. The player then has to repeat the whole process again, while avoiding touching a cable on the ground.Soon, all of his plates will pop off, and he will explode.Chilli BilliChilli WillyHailfire PeaksTwo dragon brothers who live on each summit of their respective climate-related mountain. Loves pizza.There are four cannons located on each mountain top. Get behind one and shoot as many eggs (flame eggs for Chilly Willy, ice for Chilli Billy) as possible into the back of the cannon. The player should get a minimum of 2 hits per cannon before the dragons attack.Each cannon can only fire a certain amount of shots. Once it is finished, the player must dodge the dragon's attacks and travel to the nearest available one. Fire more shots into a cannon, and eventually, the dragon should go down. Go to the other mountain and repeat the process for the faster, stronger dragon.NOTE: It does not matter which dragon is chosen first, it will always be the weakest first.Mingy JongoCloud CuckoolandA robotic impostor of Mumbo Jumbo. Lives in one of the two skulls on the map: randomly chosen for each new game.Mingy will shoot energy balls at Banjo that homes in on him, dodge these and then his wand will have to recharge. move in to strike Mingy and a slice of skin will come off revealing robotic parts. He will get wise of this technique and begin teleporting across the arena. He will fire 3-5 shots at each loacation, so hurry to strike before he teleports again. 6 strikes and Mingy will malfunction an explode.NOTE: The boss itself is not hard, but since the duo are fighting in the upper floor of Mumbo's skull, it is easy to get hit.Hag 1Cauldron KeepThe witches' massive drilling machine.The boss battle is sectioned into 10 tactics followed by a quick quiz and an first-person segment to shoot Grunty. The results on the quiz determines the speed of Grunty's attacksPhasesThe Hag 1 will have 2 lasers out and will spin, jump over them then prepare to fire at Grunty for 10 hit points down.Now 4 lasers are out, same tactic just more jumping, another FPS segment will ensue and 10 more hits off of Grunty's health.A rocket will fly up, and hit the ground and 4 missiles will fly out in different directions, jump over the explosion and the duo should dodge all the missiles. Do this 3 times and an opportunity to hit Grunty will occur.2 rockets, 8 missiles, same tactic, another 10 health points gone.Now Grunty fires up the engine, laser are back, but now Grunty adds a chase segment will the drill. Outrun her and the engine will eventually stall, allowing the duo to fire a clock-work Kazooie agg into the exaust in the back of the Hag 1. Jump above the wire, and dodge any enemies in the Hag 1 while going towards a battery, detonate, and another chance to attack Grunty will follow.Same thing as above, but with 4 lasers.Now it's straight up FPS time, hit Grunty for a total of 30 hit points this round.Grunty sends out some minions, dodge them while aiming for Grunty until only a mere 15 hitpoints are left.Grunty releases a toxic gas, shoot Grunty with eggs as fast as possible before the duo's bubbles are all gone (it is almost crucial to have saved the fish in Spiral Mountain if the player hasn't by now)At low health, Grunty charges up a super spell, it's faster and stronger, just keep moving while aiming at Grunty.NOTE: It would be optimal to have at LEAST 2 of the honeycomb upgrades from the Honey B before this fight, it is all about endurance in this fight.[CR]Stop 'n' Swop[CR]Only four of these items found their way to Banjo-Tooie[CR]Unlike, the previous game, the once fabled Stop and Swop items are now just plain old items that unlock secret moves and abilities. Originally, these items were going to be obtained by learning secret passwords in Banjo-Tooie which would reveal the items when entered in Banjo-Kazooie. The items would then be transfered back to Banjo-Tooie by way of "hot swapping" the cartridges. The N64 would hold on to a small amount of data if the player pulled the cartridge out while the system was on, and that was how Rare planned to transfer the items. However, in later models of the system, the data was cleared out of memory much quicker, making the window of time to swap the cartridges extremely brief. This eventually caused Rare to scrap the whole concept in favor of just adding them as collectibles in Banjo-Tooie. Hackers who explored Banjo-Kazooie's code found the passwords that Rare planned to reveal in Banjo-Tooie, which only served to confuse players who tried to find a way to use the mysterious items.[CR]Two of the "secret" Stop N Swop eggs can be found in Spiral Mountain hidden inside Banjo Kazooie game packs. Striking them will spit out the egg. Taking these eggs to the Egg Shed in Wooded Hollow will unlock secrets in the game. The yellow egg is already in the shed, but must be hatched by Kazooie.Pink Egg[CR]Above the stump that contains the boots in Spiral Mountain is a metal grate. Fly up there and shoot a grenade egg to bust open the grate. Fly in there and smash the pack to get the egg. This egg unlocks the ability to swing Kazooie as a club.Blue Egg[CR]Fly to the top of the waterfall in Spiral Mountain and enter the top. Using the grenade eggs, smash the metal grate and do the same thing to get the Blue Egg. This will unlock the ability to have Kazooie's eggs home at enemies.Yellow Egg[CR]Once the duo have learned the Hatch ability from Terrydactyland, go to Heggy's Egg Shed in Wooded Hollow and drill the rubble covering the split up pads. Split up and take Kazooie up to the top floor, where the yellow egg is waiting in a nest. Hatch it, and the player will get the ability to select Jinjo in multiplayer games.Ice Key[CR]In the "sandy" part of Jinjo Village, there should be a part where Banjo can shimmy on the side of the ledge. Climb that to enter a cave which has another pack in it. Smash it to get the Ice Key. After gaining the Talon Torpedo ability, go to Glitter Gulch Mine, through the Water Storage area to the Waterfall Cavern, and use the Talon Torpedo to get to the ice side of Hailfire Peaks. Use the Ice Key to unlock the Ice Safe and to obtain the Mega-Glowbo. Give that to Humba Wumba in Pine Grove to transform into Dragon Kazooie.[CR]Style and Cultural References[CR]In contrast to Banjo-Kazooie, Tooie is much darker in tone and material. Whereas Kazooie featured light-hearted music, bright and colorful levels, and an overall sense of cheeriness, Tooie is much darker in all aspects. This is apparent right off the bat, when Bottles is killed off. The levels are on the whole darker and dingier than the ones in Kazooie. The music also follows suit, feeling dark and foreboding in most of the games levels. It slows down to a creeping dirge in the darkest recesses of the world. The humor of the game often takes a sarcastic tone, with Kazooie cracking jokes about other characters incessantly.Tiptup, an old friend, resides in the lagoon[CR]Banjo-Tooie features many return appearances from characters and things first found in Banjo-Kazooie. This includes major characters such as Mumbo Jumbo, and minor ones such as Conga and Gobi. Levels from the first game are also alluded to in various ways. Rare also references games from their stable. Instances of this include Jet Force Gemini posters in Bottles' kids rooms, and an appearance by Sabreman, from their earlier game, Sabre Wulf. There are even references to other works. In the Grunty Industries level, Kazooie refers to Nintendo's Mario (and his plumber roots) by suggesting to Loggo that "maybe Mario could unclog him", to which Loggo replies that he "doesn't think Mario does that kind of work anymore". There is also a reference to E.T., as Kazooie once asks the aliens in Hailfire Peaks if "they need to phone home". Lastly, both Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie are referred to in later Rare games, most notably Viva Pinata.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Banjo-Tooie was widely praised by reviewers and is considered by many to be one of the best platforming games to be released. It is a gem of the Nintendo 64 era. The game has gorgeous visuals and it may be regarded as the best looking game on the system even though it didn&#8217;t make use of the expansion pack.[CR]Banjo-Tooie was also nominated for many prestigious awards - including a nomination for the "Moving Images Award" at the 2000 BAFTA award ceremony, and was also nominated for "Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year", "Console Game of the Year", and "Game of the Year" at the 2001 Academy Of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awards.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Version[CR]Banjo-Tooie was released on Xbox Live Arcade on April 29th, 2009 for 1200($15) Microsoft Points. The port, developed by 4J studios, resurrects the Stop n Swop features for use between Banjo-Kazooie on XBLA and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts. Additionally, the graphics are much more crisp than on the original.Price Drop History[CR]The XBOX Live Arcade version of Banjo-Tooie was dropped from 1200 Microsoft Points to 800 Microsoft Points from June 16th through to June 22nd as part of XBOX Live's "Inventory Blowout Sale".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (known in Europe as Batman of the Future: Return of the Joker) (not to be confused with Batman: Return of the Joker) is a 3D side-scrolling beat-em-up developed by Kemco and published by Ubisoft for the Game Boy Color (on November 20, 2000), PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 (both on December 13, 2000). The video game tie-in to the animated movie of the same name, it puts players as the futuristic Batman (superhero alter-ego of high-school student Terry McGinnis), as he investigates Neo-Gotham City for the whereabouts of The Joker, a resurfaced villain from the days of the original Batman (superhero alter-ego of Terry's mentor, Bruce Wayne) who plans to use a satellite laser to destroy the city.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like a traditional side-scrolling beat-em-up, as players play through five stages as Batman. Although the levels are side-scrolling, players can move anywhere around the level. Players can move him around with the analog stick, crouch with the Crouch button (C-Right on the N64), run with the Run button (L button on the N64), and jump with the Jump button (R button on the N64). He can attack using the Punch button (B button on the N64) and the Kick button (A button on the N64), and can block attacks using the Block button (Z button on the N64). Some of his abilities can be used with the Special button (C-Left on the N64).Bat Suits[CR]At any point in the game, players can switch between four different types of loadouts (called "bat suits") for Batman using the D-Pad, changing both his stats and his special abilities.[CR]Standard Suit - By wearing the Standard Suit, Batman can use his arsenal of gadgets (which can be used with the Special button and cycled through using the D-Pad): the Dark Knight Discus (thrown projectiles that require ammunition), the Dark Knight Staff (a staff swing which attacks in a circular area), and the Magnetic Nunchuku (a nunchuck attack which can be charged).[CR]Offensive Suit - More fragile than his other suits, the Offensive Suit is capable of stronger attack power and the ability to punch open certain crates. This suit allows him to perform a rolling kick (by pressing the Special button) and a low kick (by pressing the Crouch button when an enemy is close to him).[CR]Defensive Suit - Sacrificing his normal attacking power for better protection, the Defensive Suit gives him advanced shielding, allowing him to deflect most enemy attacks (using either the Special or Crouch buttons). He can also use his shielding to perform a damage-dealing Shield Punch by pressing the Special button while moving.[CR]Nimble Suit - While wearing the agility-oriented Nimble Suit and in the air, he can perform a double jump (by hitting the Jump button), a jump kick (by pressing the Kick button), or a glide (by holding down the Jump button).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flight Mode[CR]Pause the game and press Up, Down, Left(2).</plot>

		<title_clean>BattleTanx - Global Assault</title_clean>
		<plot>The year is 2049.  A nuclear holocaust has caused 99.9% of the women in the entire world to die out, leaving mankind desperate to search for women for reproduction.  Instinct has taken over, and the only rule is mob rule.  There is no form of government, form of justice, and the only way to survive is lookout for yourself.  Mobs and warlords have emerged trying to claim the world's last surviving women.[CR]In the midst of the chaos, Griffin and Madison escape back to San Francisco with their new baby boy Brandon, where they hope to rebuild a better society.  However, the evil QueenLord, Cassandra, captures him.  Cassandra leads Griffin and Madison all across America and Europe in a frantic search for Brandon, who may have psychic abilities that can save the world.[CR]Global Assault is the sequel to the original BattleTanx64.  It features ton of new weapons, new vehicles, and new powers that were never available in the original.  Global Assault now also features a destructible environment, allowing you to seize control of the environment and create ultimate destruction.  Global Assault also allows two players to play together in co-op, or four players to go head to head as one of the dozens of tank gangs in all new maps and tons more modes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get into ocean[CR]Go to London Parliament. Get a mototank. Go to the underground tunnel. Get between the tunnel and the railing. Turn towards the tunnel. The tank should sink. Hold the turn button down for five seconds. Let go. Your tank will be in the air. Go towards the ocean. You are now in the ocean![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Nuggets of Wisdom[CR]In the Level 3, Arizona Truck Stop, you can receive some "Nuggets of Wisdom." To do so, get some guided missiles (is easy to do with weapons cheat). Go back to the start, and look off to the left, OUTSIDE the map. There will be a car out there. Blow up the car with a guided missile, and read the hilarious words that come by on your screen. Some include "Squash the moto tank with a goliath!"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Commit Suicide[CR]I dont know why anyone would want to do this, but this is useful in multiplayer when you need a different tank. To do this, press all 4 C-buttons at the same time to commit suicide!</plot>

		<plot>Climb into a hover tank, and battle Soviets and aliens on the moon.  The premise of the game: The Soviets and Americans were actually fighting on the moon during the cold war, unbeknownst to the public.  You job is to command fleets of tanks against the Soviets and win the war.[CR]There are 3 completely different modes to the game.  An arcade mode in which you fight ever increasingly difficult waves of enemies.  A story mode in which you are simply a pilot where you are told exactly what your orders are.  And there is also strategy mode, in which you can build units and send them off to do battle for you.[CR]In addition to containing all the missions available in the PC version of this game, there is also additional missions that continue the story where the PC game left off.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Miscellaneous Codes[CR]Codes should be entered at the Main Menu screen, except the two codes marked otherwise. For all the codes, a different sound that you wouldn't normally hear should happen. Some of the button presses have to be done rapidly, or else they won't be triggered.</plot>

		<title_clean>Beetle Adventure Racing!</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Beetle Adventure Racing! is composed strictly of Volkswagen New Beetle vehicles, which were released the year before the game's release.[CR]The game uses six lengthy tracks in its singleplayer championships and has an impressive draw distance compared to other Nintendo 64 titles. Each track is respectively insane, with ghosts, dinosaurs, castles and alien spaceships. One level even uses WHAM!'s "Last Christmas" to set the tone.[CR]Each course features a variety of boxes strewn on or near the track. Boxes provide different rewards to the player; for instance, a nitro boost that increases speed. There are also special "Flower Boxes" that unlock cheats to modify gameplay. During singleplayer "Championship" races there are "Points Boxes" placed on the track worth varying amounts. 100 points are available on a given course, and because many boxes are placed on hidden shortcuts, a player who wishes to get the maximum number of points during a race must vary the path they take through the level each lap. Earning a full 100 points on a level unlocks new multiplayer arenas.[CR]The game is often compared to San Francisco Rush, because of its fun-oriented gameplay.[CR]Beetle Adventure Racing uses a modified version of the then-current Need for Speed engine, which manifests itself most visibly in terms of the four-point suspension and the zooming tachometer. The tracks differ slightly, however, and do not start and finish at the same point. Instead, each course has a brief entry road, the player races the allotted three laps, and the last lap switches guardrails in order to funnel the player into an exit track with a (usually dead-end) finish-line. Oddly enough, few games have employed a similar mechanic since then.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The game features a multiplayer portion for 2 to 4 players in split-screen. Two-player races can be unlocked by completing the single-player game. There is also a Beetle Battle mode, where players collect ladybugs, destroy each other and race to the finish.[CR]Race Tracks[CR]Coventry CoveMount MayhemInferno IsleSunset SandsMetro MadnessWicked Woods[CR]Unlockables[CR]Beetle Adventure Racing! contains multiple unlockable cars, each with different attributes. The final car to be unlocked is a New Beetle police car. While racing with the police car, other nearby cars can be slowed to a halt by using the car's police siren.[CR]Beyond new cars, there are many different cheats that can be unlocked by smashing the points boxes on the courses. These cheats do not necessarily make the game easier to play, and in many cases simply modify the game in interesting or amusing ways. For example, one of the early cheats earned is a "Fisheye Lens" camera that distorts the player's field of view.[CR]Regional Variation: HSV Adventure Racing! (Australia)[CR]In Australia, "HSV Adventure Racing" was released with Holden Special Vehicles instead of Volkswagen New Beetles, as well as region-specific voice work. Besides that, the two versions are identical.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 3 Bonus Beetles[CR]Complete all of the novice tracks to unlock 3 new cars.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Race on the Coventry Cove course in Championship mode until you see a barn on the right side of the road with two haystacks in front of it. Drive through the hatstack on the left and you will smash a hidden crate with a picture of a flower on it; you'll also hear a voice say, ''Groovy!''. Note that the crate will not be there unless you are playing in Championship mode. Once you've smashed the crate, finish the race; the words ''Cheat Menu Activated'' will appear at the Player Results screen. Now return to the main menu and access the Options screen; you'll find a new option called ''Cheats'' at the bottom. Each item on the cheat menu must be ''unlocked'' before you can used it; you will unlock a new cheat each time you smash a flower crate in Championship mode. Some of the crates are very well hidden, so you're going to have to do a lot of searching to find them.</plot>

In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you must finish first and before time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the laters course being wider and the flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering, acceleration, etc. are increased.[CR]2. 2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will choose.

Instead, Midway chose to finish the game and release it for home platforms in 1998.[CR]Apart from standard ground based moves, features a wide variety of aerial moves and mutilations which can instantly dismember, decapitate or bisect opponents. What is interesting is that the opponents will keep fighting even if their arms lay on the floor in gallons of blood.[CR]Playable characters[CR]BullzeyeBullzeyeDeltaMinatekPsyclownPurgeSabotageSsapoZipperheadBossesClonusMutilator[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Two nuclear bombs were being transported on a truck when a malfunction caused them to begin leaking, so the carrier was locked on a direct course for a safe detonation site. Any slight bump will cause the bombs to detonate, so the Blast Corps is called in to demolish any obstruction along the route.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is broken up into several types of levels scattered across a map over the world. On each level the player must use demolition and go through puzzles to achieve the goal. The player usually begins in a demolition vehicle, but can exit the vehicle as the Pilot. The player sees the action from the isometric viewpoint at all times.Carrier Levels[CR]The Carrier Levels are the main portion of the game. The player is in control of a member of the Blast Corps crew, whose task is to control a wide variety of vehicles to destroy any building or debris that may obstruct the nuclear carrier's path. Players are limited on time, as the carrier can not be slowed down or stopped. In addition to destroying buildings with vehicles, players must sometimes solve puzzles, such as pushing around TNT crates to destroy more robust structures, use large blocks to fill holes, and move trains, to name a few.[CR]The player can leave vehicles and move around as The Pilot, who can enter other vehicles as needed. Different vehicles have their uses and weaknesses. Once the carrier&#8217;s path is clear, the player is free to enter the Blast Corps semi to end the level, or continue exploring. Successfully completing a carrier level unlocks the levels around it. Players can choose whether to continue with the next carrier level or complete a number of side missions.[CR]Certain buildings in the level contain survivors, which once freed will be picked up automatically by the Blast Corps chopper. Scattered across the levels are small objects the light up as the player passes over them called Radiation Dispersal Units (RDUs). There are also special (and more rare) collectables such as communication devices that unlock additional levels, and scientists that are required for later missions.[CR]Players receive medals on a level to show progress. Clearing the path for the carrier earns a gold medal, and then a second medal is given depending on the number of survivors, buildings destroyed, and RDUs collected by the player. After the initial clear, the player can enter the level without a time limit and search for all of the collectables for 100% completion.[CR]Points are received for every medal, and then as points accumulate, the player receives promotions. There are 31 ranks, and a promotion is given every 12 points. Bronze medals are worth 1 point, silvers are 2, gold are 3, and platinum medals are worth 4.Side Missions[CR]Extra levels are usually time trials, which require the player to accomplish certain tasks under a time limit, such as destroying a certain number of buildings, race around a track for multiple laps, or collect all RDUs. Some levels of the side missions are tutorials for some of the more unusual or hard-to-control vehicles. The Bonus Levels sometimes feature environmental hazards, like lava, that cause the player to lose. Some levels are set in unusual settings, like one level where the player has to push TNT blocks down the pockets of a pool table. Some levels require the player to clear the path for a space shuttle, which opens a set of levels on the Moon and planets like Venus and Mars. Medals in side missions are given based on the finishing time.[CR]Demolition Vehicles[CR]Ramdozer[CR]A simple bulldozer, and typically the default vehicle. Great against small buildings, but doesn't have the power to easily take down more robust structures. Can also be used to push around TNT crates and large blocks.J-Bomb[CR]Aerial robot that uses a jetpack to achieve height then can rapidly descend to crush buildings.Backlash[CR]A dumptruck that must be put into a skid to gain enough power to ram buildings. Very difficult to control.Sideswipe[CR]A semi-like vehicle with special rams along its trailer. The player hits a button to extend the rams into buildings. Requires ammunition.Skyfall[CR]A fast buggy with a speed booster. Can only destroy buildings by gaining lift from a ramp and falling onto the buildings.Thunderfist[CR]A robot that plows through buildings by tumbling and smashing through with its fist.Cyclone Suit[CR]A smaller robot that can destroy buildings by rolling into them.Ballista[CR]A fast-moving motorcycle that can shoot ballistic missiles straight forward.

Then hold the Z button down. Your guy should yell, ''D'oh!'' Continue to hold the Z button until the object blows up.  (Note: This will not work on the PAL version of the game).</plot>

		<title_clean>Blues Brothers 2000</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Blues Brothers 2000 is based on the movie of the same name, which was released in 1998. Brought into the world by the same publishers as such dubious games as Superman 64, the game was released roughly two years after the movie it was based on. The game itself is an action platformer where everything is out to kill you.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game follows the movie's plot *very*, *VERY* roughly insofar as Elwood Blues attempts to get the band back together for a battle of the bands. The game itself tells the vast breadth of its story in still images between levels, with the occasional exchange of dialogue.[CR]It's finally time for Elwood to be released from jail, but the 'evil warden' refuses to let him leave as a helpful prison guard informs him. After rescuing Buster from a demented lunch lady, Elwood confronted the evil warden and managed to escape Joilet State Prison. Before he escaped , he learned the warden has handed over the rest of the band- 'Mighty' Mac and Cab- to the mob.[CR]Elwood managed to make his way to Chicago to find Mac and Cab, only to end up running from a sewer alligator and confronting Willy. Elwood managed to rescue Mac, but Cab was still missing.[CR]After arriving in the Spooky Graveyard and dealing with evil trees, the band was finally reunited with the rescue of Cab. The band then went to Louisiana (The Swamp) to participate in a battle of the bands, and ultimately prevailed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Blues Brothers picks up several cues from more influential platformers of the time. Elwood's slam mirrors Mario's butt stomp, and the main collectibles- notes- are back from Banjo-Kazooie. Other cues include collecting a hundred of an item for an extra life.[CR]The camera system is also referential to Super Mario 64, though inferior in implementation- the camera can get caught on walls quite easily, forcing the player to move blindly.[CR]There is a minigame based on cued-button presses, but the presses are not timed with the music and very difficult to get correctly.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Blues Brothers 2000 received mixed to negative reviews, and did not prove to be very popular- being released two years after its movie. Among the things most criticized in the game, the imprecise controls and the lackluster camera system were frequently mentioned. IGN claimed that half of the time they spent with the game was spent trying to get the camera working.[CR]Gamespot also said the game was buggy, complaining that they would get trapped in infinite damage loops.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives[CR]Find a grey wrench on the Chicago level and open up a sewer lid. There you will find 2 lives. Go out and go back in and the lives will be there again.</plot>

		<title_clean>Body Harvest</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Body Harvest is a 3D action/adventure, third-person shooter game for the Nintendo 64. The player takes the role of Adam Drake, a genetically-enhanced super soldier that travels back in time to save Earth from being destroyed by alien invaders.[CR]The game was developed by DMA Design (now known as Rockstar North), and due to that, it has many similarities with the Grand Theft Auto games, as the player uses a variety of weapons and vehicles to get through the game. This game's development actually precedes GTA 3 and gives birth to many of the concepts that would be used for the first 3D GTA game. While Nintendo was originally going to publish the game in America, they later backed out, with Midway replacing them as publisher.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Drive any vehicle you come across[CR]Since 1916, the Earth has been under constant attack by an alien force. These aliens (literally giant bugs) sought a food source and found that humans' bodies could be harvested to meet their needs (hence the name of the game). The bugs would attack a certain area of Earth, harvest bodies, then leave, only to appear again 25 years later. This is due to the fact that the invaders traveled through space aboard an artificial comet that orbits the sun. Every 25 years, their orbit would bring them close enough to Earth for attack. Attacks occurred in 1916, 1941, 1966, and 1991 until the human race was nearly instinct.[CR]In the year 2016, a few remaining human survivors orbit the Earth on a research station where they have been plotting to retake Earth. With the advent of time travel, they have formulated a plan to take genetically enhanced soldiers to the major events of the past in order to stop the alien harvest before it can annihilate the human race.[CR]Unfortunately, during the opening cinematic, the bugs attack the station, killing the majority of the crew. Adam Drake, the only surviving soldier, is injured in his escape, but manages to get to his ship and travel back in time to Greece 1916 before the aliens catch up to him. The bugs, however, take Adam's genetic material from a pool of blood he left behind due to his injury. This allows the aliens to clone Adam, and send the clone back in time to stop humanity's last hope.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player plays as Adam Drake as he travels to different times in the Earth's history as he repels the attacks of the alien invaders. There are two difficulties to chose from: Easy and Hero.Stage Structure[CR]The game has five stages: Greece in 1916, Java in 1941, America in 1966, Siberia 1991, and finally the Alien Comet in 2016. Each stage consists of a very large map, and is separated into at least three sections (divided by alien-generated shield walls) in which they must defeat an "Alien Processor" before moving on to the next section. After each Processor is dealt with, the player must destroy the shield generator and an end-stage boss. The end-stage bosses are primarily vehicle-based battles, while the Alien Processor sections can be taken on either on foot or using various vehicles found in the environment.[CR]During the Alien Processor sections, Daisy (Adam's female partner, who simply stay's in Adam's ship) gives the player missions to accomplish, such as visiting towns for clues, putting out fires with a firetruck, saving kids with an ice cream truck, or defending areas from Harvester waves.Harvester Waves[CR]These Harvester waves play major parts in the game. Every once in a while, the player will be warned of the appearance of alien Harvester, usually attacking a town. The Harvester will capture human bodies, and after it's harvested enough (represented by an on-screen meter), an enemy called a M.U.T.A.N.T. is created that will go after the player. This enemy is very difficult to defeat, so the player is encouraged to destroy the Harvester as soon as it appears to save as many humans as possible. In addition, any human the player kills himself will be added to the alien's harvest, so a M.U.T.A.N.T. can be encountered without a Harvester even present.Exploration[CR]When navigating the expansive outdoor environment, the player can either choose to have Adam traverse on foot, or commandeer vehicles, ranging from civilian cars to military tanks. Planes and boats are also necessary to further explore the environment, as the player cannot swim for very long before drowning (which is one of those things that would carry on to GTA games, characters who cannot swim).[CR]A gameplay feature that did not make it in later GTA games is the fact that vehicles require fuel to run. Each vehicle has a set amount of fuel in them, and after it runs out, the vehicle is unusable until the tank is refilled. Fuel can be found after defeating enemies or while exploring houses.[CR]The player also gets a chance to explore indoors. The indoor locales are pretty much limited to either houses or dungeons. They can enter houses and talk to NPCs for clues or items needed to progress through the story. Dungeons usually involve a puzzle to solve. Most puzzles are simply solved by interacting with objects such as torches and candles.Combat[CR]Body Harvest is played as third-person shooter. The player cannot move while shooting unless they are in a vehicle. The player can go into manual-aim mode by holding down the R-button. While in this mode, on foot, the player can make Adam roll and dodge out of the way of attacks by pressing either the left or right C-buttons. Pressing the down C-button causes Adam to essentially make a 180 degree turn and immediately aim at anything behind him. While indoors, the C-buttons also allow you to side-step, but it's pretty useless as nothing happens indoors that requires it.[CR]Enemies encountered by Adam usually take the form of giant bugs, resembling beetles, dragonflies, praying mantises, and sometimes fish. Adam also encounters his clone every once in a while to mess up his plans.[CR]Adam's standard weapon is a weak pistol that has unlimited ammo. The weapons that Adam acquires later range from human-based weapons like a machine gun, shotgun, and rifle, to magical weapons like the sun shield, a shield that shoots beams of heat at enemies. Ammo for weapons must be found while exploring areas indoors. Additionally, if the player acquires three "Weapon Crystals" in a stage, Adam gets a special, more powerful weapon to use in that stage.[CR]If the player enters a special cheat, all the normal weapons in the game are replaced by more powerful ones (ex. the machine gun becomes a rapid-fire rocket launcher).[CR]Military vehicles usually have their own weapons to use. Tanks obviously shoot explosive shells, and some armored vehicles have machine guns with unlimited ammo. At one point, the player takes control of a truck that can launch missiles, causing damage to a very large area, though it's hard to aim. The truck is mainly used to clear a landslide that impedes the player's progress.[CR]Adam's space ship, the Alpha 1, is also able to be piloted during end-stage boss battles. It has its own special weapons as well. If the vehicle is destroyed during the battle, you can continue the fight on foot, but you're likely to not survive.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]DMA Design's popular Grand Theft Auto 3 features an ice cream truck that has the same jingle as an ice cream truck that Adam must commandeer in Body Harvest.[CR]Unlike in the later GTA games, you can actually kill children during the previously mentioned ice cream truck mission, making Body Harvest a somewhat more violent game.[CR]Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas features a mission called "Body Harvest", a clear reference to the game. This mission also involves piloting a combine harvester. This is a reference to Body Harvest's Siberia stage, in which Adam uses a combine harvester to run over zombies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Enter your name as ICHEAT and use these codes during gameplay:</plot>

		<plot>Retire to the country for a new challenge in Harvest Moon 64. Hard work is rewarded as you struggle to bring prosperity back to a neglected farm. Work the land, pick up odd-jobs, and get to know the neighbors. Harvest Moon 64 has all the charm of the original Super Nintendo classic, plus many new surprises.* Tons of new seasonal vegetables and fruits.* Raise cows, chickens, and sheep.* New items and gifts. Including tools that increase in power as you master them.* One of town's five eligible women may prove to be the love of your life.* Celebrate seasonal festivals with the nearby townsfolk.* Enjoy local horse and dog racing.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dog Glitch[CR]This glitch is rather easy to use and it benefits both your relationship with Karen and your dog's affection level. [CR]To perform this glitch, simply take your dog to Karen and talk to her many times when you are holding it. It is best to do this when she is inside a building because it takes a while. As you are talking to Karen, you will see her heart level rise. [CR]There are two side effects to this glitch. First, Karen will be at a red heart (or where ever you stop). To marry her, all you need is the kitchen and a blue feather. Also, your dog will like you more. If you feed him and pick him up and run him every day, he might be able to win the first Winter Dog Race.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] up-graded tools[CR]All of these can just be used you don't have to hit anything. For the Golden items you don't have to charge them up(It doesn't make it faster.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get large milk easy:[CR]Just let your cow get sick by not feeding it or leaving it out in the rain and give it the animal medicine. You will probably have to do this three or four times to get large milk. After two times you should have medium milk. And after three times you should have large milk.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bomberman 64 marks the leap from 2D to 3D in the Bomberman series. A departure from its 2D predecessors, Bomberman 64 is a platformer game, putting the player in control of the familiar white Bomberman. Rather than just blowing up bad guys until the stage unlocks, players have to use their bomb placement as a means to advance stages and blast things to complete objectives. For those players looking for an experience similar to the Super Bomberman titles, the multiplayer battle mode is a nod to the older installments.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In Bomberman 64, Bomberman, with the help of a mysterious helper named Sirius, must prevent the evil Altair from conquering Bomber Planet. Altair travels from planet to planet, draining the energy from the planet to power his ultimate weapon, the Omni Cube. Bomberman must progress through four worlds previously conquered by Altair, which are now attached to his mobile base, before taking on Altair himself in his Black Fortress.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bomberman 64 features expansive levels.Bomberman 64 maintains many similar elements from the original games. Bomberman can place bombs or kick them in a straight line. He can also hold and throw bombs, and charge them up to give them a larger explosion area. Bomberman cannot jump, but he can "bomb jump," which involves placing a bomb below a ledge and falling down on it. This will bounce him back up, and allow him to get across gaps. Bombs can also be stacked on top of each other, which can be used in conjunction with the bomb jump to traverse high-up chasms.There are several power-ups that can be found in each level, all of which have been seen in other Bomberman titles.Extra Bombs: Allows Bomberman to have an additional bomb active.Extra Range: Expands the (spherical) range of the bomb explosions.Remote Bombs: Lets Bomberman place bombs that only explode when triggered.Super Bombs: Increases Bomberman's bombs' explosive power so they can destroy through more materials.At the onset of the game, players can choose any of the four different worlds to explore, each having multiple levels where players must use Bomberman's abilities to solve puzzles and clear obstacles as they make their way to the next zone. In the middle of each world, there will be a sub-boss fight which plays out like older Bomberman titles. At the end of each world, players will be confronted with a unique boss. After the four initial worlds have been cleared, the final world is unlocked.In every level there are five gold cards that the player can collect. They can be found in secret areas, or by accomplishing certain goals in each level. In boss fights, they are earned by damaging the boss in specific ways. For players going the extra mile and discovering every gold card (100 total), they will be presented with a secret, hidden world after the black fortress. Beating this level will earn them the true ending.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]Bomberman 64 has four world that can be played in any order, a "final" world that can only be reached after finishing the original four, and a secret world that is unlocked if the player finds all 100 gold cards. Each world has a sub-boss, which is usually one of Altair's minions, and a final boss.Worlds and BossesGreen Gardens: The simplest world, and is intended to be the first played. In the first level of this world serves as a tutorial, with Sirius explaining how the game is played. He also appears as the sub-boss of this world.Blue Mountain: A water-based world, which is otherwise fairly similar to Green Gardens. Artemis is the sub-boss for this world.Red Mountain: A lava-based world. Orion is the sub-boss, who escapes when Bomberman defeats him. The final boss is a mobile suit-like machine called Hades, which is being controlled by Orion.White Glacier: A snow and ice-based world with Regulus as the sub-boss. Regulus, like Orion, escapes after the fight.Black Fortress: The final non-secret world, home to Altair. Upon being defeated by Bomberman, Regulus returns to save Altair, and Bomber Planet is saved.Rainbow Palace: The true final world, reachable after earning all 100 gold cards. It is revealed the Sirius is the actual enemy, and he is the final boss of this world.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]This game was fairly well received by critics and consumers, and was considered to be a solid transition from 2D into 3D for the Bomberman franchise. Bomberman 64 opened the doors for two more sequels on the Nintendo 64: Bomberman Hero and Bomberman 64: The Second Attack.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Eggy in all the stages[CR]To make a artificial Eggy just go to a stage where the screen freezes when catching something or pressing a switch, go for one remote bomb and before you press the switch or catch something set a remote bomb, and move it one centimeter before you get the thing or press it.Then,explode the bomb and immediately get or press the thing to make a artificial eggy.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Story Mode[CR]Seven of the eight Astral Knights[CR]The game opens with Bomberman flying in a spaceship back to his home planet accompanied by a strange egg, when his ship is sucked into a black hole. Bomberman loses consciousness, and later awakes to find himself in a jail cell with the mysterious egg, but without the Fire Stone that allows him to use his trademark bombs. The egg hatches shortly afterwards, and the creature that emerges introduces himself as Pommy. Pommy is able to slip through the bars of the cell to retrieve Bomberman's Fire Stone, and with it Bomberman is able to escape. The two later learn that they were imprisoned by henchmen working for the Astral Knights, an evil group collecting the seven Elemental Stones. Bomberman and his new friend set out to stop the Astral Knights from executing whatever they're planning.[CR]The Story Mode has eight levels, each one a planet with a different theme. Each planet has a boss fight against one of the Astral Knights, six of whom carry an elemental stone. Gameplay is much like that of Bomberman 64, although 64's spherical explosions have been replaced with the traditional cross shaped explosions found in 2D entries of the series. One of the biggest additions to The Second Attack are the new types of bombs that Bomberman can use. After most boss fights Bomberman collects a new Elemental Stone that allows him to use a new type of bomb. These new bombs often must be used to advance past certain sections, such as using ice bombs to freeze water or wind bombs to blow Bomberman across a gap.[CR]The other big addition to The Second Attack is Pommy. At first Pommy can aid Bomberman by stunning enemies, but he can evolve into stronger forms with different attacks if Bomberman collects enough food. The type of food that Bomberman collects will affect what Pommy evolves into. Pommy can either be controlled by the AI or a second player.[CR]Battle Mode[CR]The Second Attack features five multiplayer modes; Survival, Battle Royal, King &amp; Knights, Key Trial, and Score Attack. The options allow players to change the number of rounds it takes to win and the amount of time in each round. Some modes also have options for ghosts, sudden death, and shuffle.[CR]Survival Mode is the traditional Bomberman multiplayer mode. Four players try to blow each other up, and the last player left standing is declared the winner.[CR]In Battle Royal players receive ten points for killing another player, and lose five points for dying. The player with the most points when time runs out wins.Promotional art of Bomberman protecting his king from the opposing team[CR]In King &amp; Knights the players are split into two teams and must protect an inanimate king while trying to kill the other team's kings. Each king has either 4, 7, or 10 hit points depending on how the player set the game up. Players can pick up and move either king, which is an integral part of ensuring they're safe.[CR]In Key Trial two keys are hidden within objects in the map, and players compete to collect both keys. If a player with a key is caught in an explosion they'll drop it, allowing any player to pick it back up. Unlike most other game modes, Key Trial is played in split-screen.[CR]In Score Attack players compete to accumulate the most points before time runs out is the winner. Points are acquired by blowing up animals or containers, and collecting the food they leave behind. Like Key Trial, Score Attack is played in split-screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Salesman[CR]You can unlock a different look for the salesman in the Merchant Ship Frontier. First, you must unlock the four "cowboy parts" in the shop by buying all the other parts (Not hints, the etc. items, or the parts found in the stages) from the shop first. Buy the four cowboy parts after they are unlocked, and the salesman will look different from now on in the save file this was accomplished on.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Computer Characters in Battle Mode[CR]First, a Red Cup (received when challenge 5 is completed) must be obtained in each of the five battle modes.  This will unlock the first secret option, which allows you to play as computer characters in battle. [CR]Now, on the character select screen in battle mode, hold down Z and press A.  You can now choose to be any of the computer characters. </plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Bomberman Hero is the second Bomberman released for the  Nintendo 64. While not a direct sequel to  Bomberman 64, there are several similarities to its predecessor. Again, Bomberman must venture to multiple worlds, using whatever means necessary to solve puzzles, clear obstacles and reach the end goal. This time around though, Bomberman's move set has been expanded and retuned. Now Bomberman can jump, throws bombs farther and has more lives. One major change for the series is the lack of a multi-player mode, and means that Hero focuses entirely on the single player experience while a new addition is the introduction of vehicles: a jetpack and a submarine suit that attach to Bomberman for certain segments.Once again, Bomberman must save the world from evil invaders, only this time they've kidnapped Princess Millian. Bomberman must venture world to world defeating Bosses as he tries to rescue the Princess. Again like Bomberman 64, the player is allowed to venture to a new planet and unlock the true ending of the game only after receiving a perfect score in each proceeding level.

The arcade version could be played with up to four players at once, with each cabinet linked together. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]California Speed is an arcade racing game, much similar to games such as Cruis'n USA, and San Francisco Rush. The arcade version had a total of 14 different levels, three not included in the N64 version, while the N64 version had five levels not included in the arcade version. [CR]Each level had its own difficulty - easy, advanced, or expert, along with its own unique music track. Certain tracks would have unique traits, such as bombs dropping from a aircraft, or a mall that had pedestrians that could be run over. Multiple tracks would have shortcuts, and would also have traffic that would have to be avoided. After picking a track, several cars were available to choose from, as well as the option to pick from manual or automatic transmission. [CR]A timer would run throughout the entire race, and going through checkpoints would extend time. The arcade version would award a free game for coming in first place.

		<title_clean>Castlevania</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Reinhardt Schneider, one of the game's main protagonists.[CR]Castlevania (known in Japan as Akumaj&#333; Dracula Mokushiroku, translated to Devil's Castle Dracula Apocalypse) is a 3D action-adventure horror platformer developed by KCE Kobe and published by Konami for the Nintendo 64 on January 26, 1999. Often known as Castlevania 64 (to prevent confusion with the original Castlevania), Castlevania is the first game in the Castlevania franchise to include 3D gameplay. The game was remade (along with a new prequel story) later in the year as Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Castlevania 64 starts out with players choosing between two different characters to play as. The first, Carrie Fernandez, is a young orphan who possesses the ability to use and create magic. She wears magic like armlets that serve as the players main attack weapon. The other selectable protagonist is Reinhardt Schneider, whom derives from the series infamous Belmont clan. Reinhardt is equipped with both a Whip for primary attacks, as well as, a sword for close encounters. Both of these characters share the common goal of stopping Lord Count Dracula who's returned to throne and crown the forces of darkness after a century of dormancy. The Plot has some back story that isn't directly in line with past games in the series. In Castlevania 64's universe, Dracula awakes in 1852 due to human beings rancor and vein, this has some how awaken the monster from his eternal slumber. Of the entire population on earth, only two very special gifted youths sense Count Dracula's presence. Carrie Fernandez, a young gypsy who has no family, and the latest Belmont Clan Vampire hunter, Reinhardt Schneider, also feels Dracula's arrival. The two set out to Castlevania to destroy the forces of darkness, and end the reign of Count Dracula.[CR]As the two progress, and make their way through the gardens and pass the castle walls, an aristocratic vampire materializes to deliver a warning message to Carrie and Reinhardt that all those who oppose the Dark Lord will parish. Regardless of the creatures threats, the duo proceed on. The players soon come across a mansion where they meet Charles Vincent, an older vampire hunter who has also set sail to destroy the lord of darkness. Carrie and Reinhardt also stumble into Rosa, a young girl that is also a vampire. After meeting either of these characters, players discover the route to Dracula's castle, but they must first go through the terrace, a maze, and then the underground area and catacombs to reach the castle itself. Players meet the game's item seller, and everyone's favorite demon merchant, Renon. Renon is used to buy recovery items, more sub weapons and also gives info, since he's on nobody's side, but money. As the young hunters make way into the garden maze, they are met by a Frankenstein look-a-like wielding a chainsaw, who is also chasing a little kid. This is one of the game's many boss encounters and set's up a sub character, Malus. The heroes proceed underground and beyond, and this is when Count Dracula begins to feel the pressure. He's sends his main generals or servants Actrise and Death, to stop the pair once and for all. Carrie Fernandez is pitted against one of her only known family members, who is under the control of the generals of darkness. Reinhardt Schneider is put against his love interest Rosa, who he beats, but does not kill.[CR]After the heroes best these lines of defense, they find themselves asending the Clock tower that will lead them to The castle keep. There, Actrise will be awaiting as well as the one and only Death. After these titans are vanquished, players have arrived at the castle keep and set foot in Count Draculas door step. Once players have penetrated Castlevania, the heroes battle any number of people depending on several factors. If you took sixteen or more in game days, you receive the bad ending in which Charles Vincent has already arrived and been beaten. You must then fight Vincent, not matter what. You discover that it was not the aristocratic vampire that was Dracula, but rather the boy Malus, however, in the bad ending, the heroes are unaware of this and therefore are damned. In Reinhardt Schnieder's ending, he's thinks by killing Vincent and the aristocratic vampire, that he's killed Count Dracula, still unaware that Malus is the lord of Darkness. He and Malus ride off into the sunset. In carries ending, she is taken by Malus or Count Dracula and forced to marry him and therefore is condemned to a life of agony. The Good endings play out if you beat the game in fifteen in game days or less, and they are; The hero reaches the castle before Vincent and defeats the aristocratic Vampire. Then, Malus appears as an adult possessed by a demon and attacks. You must then defeat him. After the battle he returns to the state of a child, but before Carrie or Reinhardt go to rescue him, Vincent arrives and pours Holy water all over him, destroying his incarnate of a child. Players must then battle the incarnate of Count Dracula as a dragon named Drago. After players defeat the spawn of Count Dracula himself, they will receive the good endings. For Carrie's ending she places a necklace on her step-mother's grave and finds inner peace. In Reinhardt's ending, Rosa the love of his life, who sacrificed herself for Reinhardt atop the Room of Clocks during the story, is resurrected and is a pure blood human once again. The heroes live on, but Dracula's return is ever growing.[CR]Upon finishing the game, players unlocked costumes for both characters that were old outfits from past games in the series.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]There are two characters which are playable in Castlevania, down from the developers' original intention to have four. They each have very different storylines and attack styles.Reinhardt Schneider[CR]Like his brethren, Ralph, Simon and Richter, Reinhardt (originally named Schneider Belmont) is a vampire killer descended by blood and ancestry from the infamous Belmont clan of vampire hunters. The past acts of legend, valor and life-saving are now long forgotten among the Schneider's peers. Schneider vows to renew his family's honor. "Some day, the time will come when I have to fight the dark again!" he mutters.[CR]When Reinhardt's father, Michael, decides to become a vampire hunter to honor the family tradition, Reinhardt spends his time training in a forest near to his hometown of Wallachia. After his father's retirement ten years later, a rumor surfaces that Dracula has been resurrected, and Reinhardt begins his journey to the castle holding the whip of the Belmonts... According to those villagers who know him, Reinhardt has an unapproachable atmosphere around him. This is due to his revered but mysterious background. An intrepid figure, he is a gentle yet highly combative young man with a righteous mind.Carrie Fernandez[CR]The family of Fernandez, Spanish immigrants travelling throughout Eastern Europe, chanced upon Dracula's castle many moons ago, and utilizing a sacred family power of the orb, managed to repel both bandits, demonic intrusions and all manner of evil from their wagon train. However, after a particularly vicious attack by a form of Dracula himself, the patriarchal figure of the Fernandez family (a great warrior known as Sypha) fell under dark trickery.[CR]The family, although wracked with despair, did not cease to be. A small orphan called Carrie (originally named Carrie Eastfield), exhibited strange talents of light summoning and was traced back to the family after a lengthy search through records by her foster mother. A gentle child, Carrie watched with horror as a band of devils descended upon their Romanian village and attempted to attack her. Diving to save her child, Carrie's mother was killed and at that moment, a great orb of light was instantly summoned by the screaming Carrie and directed at the demons, which promptly writhed in agony and vanished. Her destiny has called, and Carrie realizes she must fight the demonic intrusions.[CR]Carrie's parents exhibited the same power and were condemned and burnt as witches by a suspicious judiciary, fearful of anything that could be likened to the resurrection of Dracula. Only recently realizing this fact, Carrie halts her beliefs in an uncaring God and closes her mind to adults, disliking them. Hearing of Dracula's most recent resurrection, Carrie decides to investigate the castle...[CR]Other Notable Characters[CR]Malus[CR]In a tiny hamlet to the south of Wallachia, Malus lived a a happy life with his parents. However, when the resurrection of Dracula occurred, a messenger rode into his village with the news that dark flying figures had been seen in the nearby moors. Surely enough, the hamlet was subsequently attacked and burned to the ground by devils. Amid the ashes, Malus is plucked from the smoldering ruins of his home, borne on the back of a devil, and flown to Dracula's citadel where he remains a prisoner in a dungeon cell. Obviously, the ingenuity of the child knows no bounds, and he seems to have broken free of his prison.[CR]He has no clue to why Dracula kidnapped him, indeed he appears startlingly calm for one so young...Rosa[CR]A beautiful, yet luckless woman who has recently been infected by a vampire. Once a servant girl in the castle's rose-garden, tending to many bouquets of white satin roses. Alas, since the bit infected her nervous system, she no longer feels like the Rosa of old, but continues to water her roses... although she has found a new liquid fertilizer. Despite her vampirec appearance, her soul has been fighting this state, and she has been known to shout "I curse my own rotting body" and "do not let my unsaved soul die!"[CR]Somewhere deep in her thoughts lies the promise of salvation, she sees a brave man striding in to save her and the world from the terrible fate that awaits...Vincent the Vampire Killer[CR]A rather boastful and arrogant, yet slightly jolly fellow, especially for a Vampire Hunter, Vincent calls himself "the strongest vampire Killer". He is a scholar who has spent his entire life studying vampires and lycanthropy, and well-known in literary circles as an authority on these dreaded beings, publishing his results of "field study" in hugely detailed tomes.[CR]His clothing comes complete with a number of additional extras, including holy water, garlic, a wooden stake and a crucifix. Although he loves to sleep, he provides vitally important information in regard to the quest.Heinrich Meyer[CR]Heinrich Meyer, a nearby merchant, visited the castle of Dracula five years prior to ply his trade of wooden artifacts, aware of the presence of evil, but not letting that get in the way of a sale. Once inside the castle, he was offered some tea buy a rather pale looking butler... Waking up three days later, he discovered to his horror that he was tied to a huge wooden operating bench, and a small mad scientist was working furiously on inserting a number of needles into his arm. The rest of his body covered in leeches, Heinrich let out an awful scream and then realized the true terror of his predicament. A thick rasping noise sounded from his lips... As he looked down, he saw blue scales covering his torso and legs. He was changing...[CR]The fearful and quite mad Heinrich, now completely transformed into a lizard man, is kept in a castle bedroom. He keeps a key for company, and runs from the slightest aggression.Renon the Salesman[CR]Masquerading as a salesman (complete with an old suit, a rather dapper bowler hat and an ornate hand watch), Renon's pointed tail gives his true nature away, he is a devil.[CR]His chosen profession however, is to sell items to adventures or brave souls who visit the castle, before watching their demise with amused glee. A mysterious man who is initially very friendly and cooperative, though his contract comes with some fine print that is not to be ignored.Actrise[CR]Actrise was a stage actress who wished for eternal beauty and fame. To this end, she bargained with the Devil himself, and her soul was thus sold. Now completely deranged after years of creeping madness, she shows her willingness to become a vampire by journeying to the Count's castle and proclaiming her foul deed: She slays one hundred children a year in praise of Dracula, and collects their souls in a number of gems. To make matters worse for this hated hag, she sacrificed her own doughter to the Devil when her contract with him suddenly ended, and was restored to eternal life shortly thereafter.[CR]Sensing the power present in Carrie, Dracula orders Actrise to win over the girl to the cause of evil, or die trying.The Fernandez Warrior[CR]One of Actrise's brood and Carrie's blood-relation, the Fernandez warrior only appears briefly during Carrie's journey, tormenting and taunting her to return to her family roots and become a witch herself. She can summon in spirits by a simple smile (she calls it her " death grin"), and physical attacks are difficult to land as she lives in the Astral plane, and her earthly body is completely ethereal. Recently vampiric, she strikes with force against her will, as she would never intentionally harm her family.Death[CR]The confrere of Dracula himself, this lesser God has descended from another world to pursue a perverse set of goals, to confront Reinhardt, blood-relations of the Belmonts, Dracula's arch rivals. Previously, Death controlled the soul of Rosa and sent her to defeat Reinhardt when he realized that Reinhardt could not be swayed to the path of Vampirism. Of course, the pure heart of Rosa allows her to protect Reinhardt, although she herself dies. A now furious Reinhardt faces this flying scythe-wielding fiend, who can summon both sickles and huge green fish to aid him.Gilles de Rais[CR]A faithful servant who has worked for Dracula since ancient times. His great age makes him the closest to a complete vampire in all facets, but he serves his darker lord all the same. Gilles de Rais knows that Dracula was born again as a human child. In order to locate his master and control the power, he commences a mass kidnapping of all the children from nearby hamlets, using both his devils and the help of Actrise to help his cause. He gathers the children in the castle, and locates the resurrected power of Dracula in a small boy called Malus. However, before the complete transformation and rebirth can be completed, he hears that two vampire hunters have infiltrated his castle. To deceive them, he changes his appearance and behaves as if he is Dracula himself.Dracula[CR]After being defeated be the Belmonts, Dracula's material body vanished, and his soul was banished for one hundred years, only to be resurrected in the form of Malus. Malus does not have any memories of his previous life, but the devils notice their evil leader's traits in the immense dark power that Malus wields.[CR]One devil was even honored enough to transform into a demonic steed for the boy. However, another even more frightening power he wields appears to be being summoned by Malus. By the ritual sacrificing of the children captured by the devils, Malus' powers of transformation begin to surface as he remembers his true vicious nature. Malus is only the initial stage of ultimate evil, as Dracula's true form reveals.[CR]Beta Characters[CR]A large number of characters and enemies did not make it into the final version of Castlevania.Cornell[CR]Cornell (initially named "Cornell Reinhardt") was the first of two playable protagonist characters that were scrapped during the game's development. He did, however, make the cut for the followup edition of the game, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, though his backstory was a bit darker in it's original conception.[CR]Rather than being a member of the man-beast tribe, Cornell's werewolf transformation ability was actually a curse placed by Dracula on his ancestors. The curse was revived when Dracula reawakened and the dark lord's minions proceeded to attack Cornell's village.[CR]In their panic and desperation, Cornell and his sister, Ada Reinhardt, regressed into lycanthropes in their attempt to save a child from nearby a monster. Having witnessed the frightening transformations, the people of the village feared what might happen if the Reinhardts would turn against them, and both captured and executed Ada. Filled with rage, Cornell abandoned his village and made his way to Dracula's castle, with the intent of ending the curse of his blood once and for all.Coller[CR]Coller is the second of two playable protagonist characters which were scrapped from the game's development. Little is known of his backstory, though the developers have stated that he was an artificial human and could not become vampirized.[CR]Bits of Coller's concept and design did make it into the game as a chainsaw-equipped Frankenstein's monster, which acts as the gardener in the Villa's hedge maze.Coller 2[CR]An artificial human, Coller2 was designed to be the main antagonist of Coller during his quest through Dracula's castle. Whereas the original Coller was quite primitive in construction, his rival's design was sleek and advanced.[CR]When Coller was scrapped from the game, Coller2 went with him. The "2" represents the model number by which she was manufactured.Majo (Witch)[CR]In volume 3 of Konami Magazine (July 1997), this enemy was introduced and labeled "Majo" (&#39764;&#22899;), though it is possible that her true name was Carmilla, as she bears a striking resemblance to the recurring Castlevania villainess. KCEK, the development team behind the game, would later feature Carmilla in their future handheld entry, "Castlevania: Circle of the Moon".[CR]Majo was described as being extremely dangerous. After preparing an attack via a high incantation, she would call out &#12300;&#27515;&#12434;&#21628;&#12406;&#12301; ("Death has called!") and cast a spell which could cause instant-death to the castle intruder. An early tech demo trailer of Castlevania showed heroine Carrie briefly battling Majo; it is possible that the enemy was replaced by Actrise as the girl's main rival.Mummy-chan[CR]Mummy-chan (&#12510;&#12511;&#12385;&#12419;&#12435;) was set to be a regular enemy in the game, who attacked with a Taekwondo fighting style. Her special attack was the "Nerichagi," which could take down the player in one hit. It is highly likely that she would have been an enemy encountered during Cornell's quest, suggested both by the accompanying concept art and that the lycanthrope would have also used martial arts moves to attack.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack of the game was composed by Masahiko Kimura, Motoaki Furukawa and Mariko Egawa. It was released on March 26th, 1999 in Japan and May 1999 in Europe.Track Listing[CR]01. Introduction[CR]02. Setting[CR]03. Prologue[CR]04. Shudder[CR]05. Intrusion[CR]06. Watchtower[CR]07. Annex.

		<plot>[CR]Playable Characters [CR]There are four characters which are playable  in Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, each have very different storylines and attack styles.    Cornell (aka. "Blue Crescent Moon")Through the magic of the Ancients, this man-beast warrior has obtained a physical body of near immortality, and power that surpasses that of a wild beast.The man-beasts, choosing to live in harmony with humans, sealed away their enormous magical powers to prevent them from being used. However, through severe ascetic training,       Cornell acquired the art of releasing the sealed man-wolf power.Returning to his village after a year of ascetic training, Cornell finds the village engulfed in flame, and his only living blood relative, his sister Ada, kidnapped by evil spirits. Using his man-wolf's acute sense of smell to track the scent of his sister's blood, Cornell begins his long journey to rescue Ada.    Henry Oldrey Henry's first appearance is as a small child during Cornell's quest. The man-beast saves him from the hedge maze's Frankenstein gardener and helps him escape from the Villa, which up until that point had been his home.   After Cornell's quest, adult Henry becomes a playable character, where which he must save six children who were kidnapped and taken to Dracula's castle to be sacrificed. Unlike most Castlevania protagonists, he uses a gun as his main weapon of choice.       Reinhardt  Schneider  Like his brethren  (                                                           Ralph,                                                           Simon and                                                          Richter),                                                         Reinhardt is a vampire                 killer descended by blood and ancestry from the infamous  Belmont                 clan of vampire hunters. The past acts of legend, valor  and  life-saving                are now long forgotten among the Schneider's  peers.  Schneider vows                to renew his family's honor. "Some  day, the time will come  when                I have to fight the dark  again!" he mutters.   When  Reinhardt's father,                 Michael, decides to become a vampire hunter to honor the  family                 tradition, Reinhardt spends his time training in a forest  near  to                his hometown of Wallachia. After his father's  retirement  ten years                later, a rumor surfaces that  Dracula has been  resurrected, and                Reinhardt begins his  journey to the castle holding the  whip of the                 Belmonts... According to those villagers who know him,  Reinhardt                 has an unapproachable atmosphere around him. This is due  to  his                revered but mysterious background. An intrepid  figure, he  is a gentle                yet highly combative young man  with a righteous mind.     Carrie  Fernandez The family of  Fernandez, Spanish immigrants  travelling throughout              Eastern Europe, chanced upon  Dracula's castle many moons  ago, and              utilizing a sacred  family power of the orb, managed to repel  both              bandits,  demonic intrusions and all manner of evil from  their wagon               train. However, after a particularly vicious attack by a  form of  Dracula              himself, the patriarchal figure of the Fernandez  family (a  great warrior              known as                                                      Sypha) fell under dark trickery.   The  family,  although wracked              with despair, did not cease to  be. A small orphan called                                                      Carrie, exhibited              strange  talents of light summoning and was traced back to  the family               after a lengthy search through records by her foster mother.  A  gentle              child, Carrie watched with horror as a band of  devils  descended upon              their Romanian village and attempted  to attack her. Diving  to save              her child, Carrie's mother  was killed and at that moment, a  great              orb of light was  instantly summoned by the screaming Carrie  and directed              at  the demons, which promptly writhed in agony and  vanished. Her               destiny has called, and Carrie realizes she must fight the  demonic               intrusions.   Carrie's parents exhibited the same  power and  were condemned              and burnt as witches by a  suspicious judiciary, fearful of  anything              that could be  likened to the resurrection of Dracula. Only  recently               realizing this fact, Carrie halts her beliefs in an uncaring  God and               closes her mind to adults, disliking them. Hearing of   Dracula's most              recent resurrection, Carrie decides to  investigate the  castle...  [CR]Other Notable Characters[CR]  Ada  Cornell's cheerful, lively little sister who has been kindnapped by the evil Count Dracula's minions. She is to be used as a sacrifice in order for the Vampire Count to fully complete his recovery.In order to save his sister from the clutches of Dracula Ultimate, Cornell relinquishes his man-beast power.     Ortega Cornell's childhood friend, Ortega is a fellow beast-man soldier and master of the martial arts. Though he is Cornell's best friend, he is also his rival. Ortega is often frustrated because it seems that whatever he does, Cornell does it better. From this jealousy, Ortega sells his soul to the devil, and allies himself with Dracula's minions in return for a power that can surpass that of Cornell.  Mary Oldrey The mother of Henry Oldrey. After learning that her husband has become a vampire, she hides herself inside of her room until Cornell appears. She then asks the man-beast warrior to seek out and protect her son.  Master Oldrey Lord of the Castle's Villa and father of Henry Oldrey. He was turned into a vampire by Actrise and Gilles de Rais. After failing to apprehend his wife with the intention of drinking her blood, he decides to attack Cornell instead.  Malus In  a tiny hamlet  to the south of Wallachia, Malus lived a a happy                 life with his parents. However, when the resurrection of   Dracula                occurred, a messenger rode into his village with  the news  that dark                flying figures had been seen in the  nearby moors. Surely  enough,                the hamlet was subsequently  attacked and burned to the  ground by                devils. Amid the  ashes, Malus is plucked from the  smoldering ruins                of his  home, borne on the back of a devil, and flown to  Dracula's                 citadel where he remains a prisoner in a dungeon cell.  Obviously,                 the ingenuity of the child knows no bounds, and he seems   to have                broken free of his prison.   He has no  clue to why Dracula  kidnapped                him, indeed he appears  startlingly calm for one so young...      Rosa  A beautiful, yet  luckless woman who has recently been  infected by              a vampire. Once a servant girl in the castle's  rose-garden,  tending              to many bouquets of white satin  roses. Alas, since the bit  infected              her nervous system,  she no longer feels like the Rosa of  old, but              continues to  water her roses... although she has found a new  liquid               fertilizer. Despite her vampirec appearance, her soul has  been fighting               this state, and she has been known to shout "I curse my  own               rotting body" and "do not let my unsaved soul die!"                Somewhere deep in her thoughts lies the promise of   salvation, she              sees a brave man striding in to save her and  the world from  the terrible              fate that awaits...    Vincent  the Vampire Killer A rather boastful  and arrogant, yet  slightly jolly fellow, especially                for a Vampire Hunter,  Vincent calls himself "the strongest                 vampire Killer". He  is a scholar who has spent his entire  life                studying  vampires and lycanthropy, and well-known in  literary circles                 as an authority on these dreaded beings, publishing his  results                 of "field study" in hugely detailed tomes.                 His clothing comes complete with a number of additional  extras,                 including holy water, garlic, a wooden stake and a   crucifix. Although                he loves to sleep, he provides vitally   important                information in regard to the quest.    Heinrich Meyer Heinrich Meyer, a nearby merchant, visited the castle of Dracula five years prior to ply his trade of wooden artifacts, aware of the presence of evil, but not letting that get in the way of a sale. Once inside the castle, he  was offered some tea buy a rather pale looking butler... Waking up three days later, he discovered to his horror that he was tied to a huge wooden operating bench, and a small mad scientist was working furiously on inserting a number of needles into his arm. The rest of his body covered in leeches, Heinrich let out an awful scream and then realized the true terror of his predicament. A thick rasping noise sounded from his lips... As he looked down, he saw blue scales covering his torso and legs. He was changing...   The fearful and quite mad Heinrich, now completely transformed into a lizard man, is kept in a castle bedroom. He keeps a key for company, and runs from the slightest aggression.  Renon  the Salesman          Masquerading as a salesman (complete  with an old suit, a  rather dapper              bowler hat and ornate  hand watch),                 Renon's pointed  tail  gives his              true nature away, he is a devil.               His chosen profession however, is to sell items to   adventures or brave              souls who visit the castle, before  watching their demise  with amused              glee. A mysterious man  who is initially very friendly and  cooperative, though his contract  comes with some fine print that is not to be ignored.                    Actrise                     Actrise was a   stage actress who wished for eternal beauty and fame.                 To this end, she bargained with the Devil himself, and her  soul                 was thus sold. Now completely deranged after years of  creeping  madness,                she shows her willingness to become a vampire by   journeying to the                Count's castle and proclaiming her  foul deed: She slays  one hundred                children a year in  praise of Dracula, and collects their  souls in                a number  of gems. To make matters worse for this hated  hag, she                 sacrificed her own doughter to the Devil when her contract  with                 him suddenly ended, and was restored to eternal life  shortly  thereafter.                Sensing the power present in Carrie,  Dracula orders  Actrise to                win over the girl to the cause  of evil, or die trying.                  The  Fernandez Warrior[CR]  One of Actrise's brood and Carrie's  blood-relation, the Fernandez warrior  only appears              briefly  during Carrie's journey, tormenting and taunting her  to return               to her family roots and become a witch herself. She can  summon               in spirits by a simple smile (she calls it her " death   grin"),              and physical attacks are difficult to land as she  lives  in the              Astral plane, and her earthly body is  completely ethereal.  Recently              vampiric, she strikes with  force against her will, as she  would never              intentionally  harm her family.      Death[CR] The  confrere of  Dracula himself, this lesser God has descended from                 another world to pursue a perverse set of goals, to  confront  Reinhardt,                blood-relations of the Belmonts, Dracula's  arch rivals.  Previously,                   Death  controlled the soul of Rosa and sent her to defeat  Reinhardt                 when he realized that Reinhardt could not be swayed to the  path                 of Vampirism. Of course, the pure heart of Rosa allows her   to protect                Reinhardt, although she herself dies. A now  furious  Reinhardt faces                this flying scythe-wielding  fiend, who can summon both  sickles and                huge green fish  to aid him.[CR]    Gilles  de Rais[CR] A faithful servant who has  worked for Dracula  since ancient times. His great age makes him the  closest to               a complete vampire in all facets, but he serves his darker lord all  the same.              Gilles de Rais knows that Dracula was born again  as a human child.  In order              to locate his master and  control the power, he commences a  mass kidnapping              of all  the children from nearby hamlets, using both his  devils and the help of  Actrise to help his cause. He gathers the children in  the castle,               and locates the resurrected power of Dracula in a small boy   called              Malus. However, before the complete transformation  and  rebirth can              be completed, he hears that two vampire  hunters have  infiltrated his              castle. To deceive them, he  changes his appearance and behaves as if he is Dracula himself.    Dracula [CR] After being  defeated be the Belmonts,                  Dracula's  material body vanished,              and his soul was banished for one  hundred years, only to be  resurrected              in the form of  Malus. Malus does not have any memories of  his previous               life, but the devils notice their evil leader's traits in  the immense               dark power that Malus wields.             One devil  was even honored enough to transform into a  demonic steed               for the boy. However, another even more frightening power he  wields               appears to be being summoned by Malus. By the ritual   sacrificing of              the children captured by the devils, Malus'  powers of  transformation begin to surface as he remembers his true  vicious  nature. Malus is only the  initial              stage of  ultimate evil, as Dracula's true form reveals.

		<plot>Centre Court Tennis is a tennis game that does not take itself too seriously. After creating your Lego-like character, you are set to go! [CR]The basic game features a multiplayer mode (up to 4 players), a tournament mode and an exhibition mode. You also have four mini-games, "Tennis Court Bingo", "Burning Barrels", "Run and Gun" &amp; Knock'em Down", where your goal is to hit certain objects in the tennis field. You can win special prices for getting enough points.[CR]Additionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd conditions - your tennis field might be rotating, made from ice or about to explode, to name a few. Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choosing from your opponent's dressing room. Lose and you lose an item that your opponent picked. Keep on losing and you have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of family-friendly strip tennis.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Chameleon Twist (&#12459;&#12513;&#12524;&#12458;&#12531;&#12484;&#12452;&#12473;&#12488; Kamereon Tsuisuto) is a 3D platformer for the Nintendo 64 developed by Sunsoft and released in 1997.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The main conflict of the game is very similar to that of Alice in Wonderland in that the protagonist curiously follows a white rabbit down a hole, which leads them into a magical realm and away from reality. The protagonist in Chameleon Twist is none other than a chameleon, who upon entering the mysterious hole is transformed into a humanoid form (albeit having chameleon characteristics).[CR] [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can choose from one of four chameleons to play as. However, the trademark character is Davey, the blue chameleon. As you progress through the game, you make your way through six platform filled levels, following the rabbit the entire journey, trying to find a way out of the bizarre world. Platforming in Chameleon Twist revolves around the use of your tongue, which acts as both a way of transportation and attacking. The tongue's powers allow the player to cling onto ledges and poles to advance across platforms and through levels, as well as lets the player attack enemies by grabbing them with the tongue and swallowing them. Or, as an alternative, the player can spit swallowed enemies back out to act as a projectile to eliminate other enemies. Sticking out the tongue also allows the player to control it using the analog stick, letting them curve it as opposed to it always heading in a straight line. Once the tongue reaches to its full length or is blocked by an obstruction, it will retract back into the chameleon's mouth. The tongue can also act similar to a pole used in pole vaulting, letting the player jump over large gaps that would otherwise be impassable.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Chameleon Twist features two types of multiplayer battle modes, in which (up to) four players play as one of four chameleons. The goal is to knock all of the other players off of the stage by shooting enemies at each other. Multiplayer options include four different difficulty settings, adjustable time lengths, and a choice of four stages for both the Time Trial and Battle Royal modes.Battle Royal[CR]The Battle Royal multiplayer mode sees the players trying to become the 'last man standing' as they attempt to knock each other off of a suspended platform, using their long chameleon tongues.Time Trial[CR]Similar to Battle Royal, Time Trial sees the players trying to knock each other off a suspended platform. The twist in Time Trial mode is that the winner is the player who stays on the platform for the longest amount of time, not necessarily the player who is left standing at the end.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Chameleon Twist 2</title_clean>
		<plot>Chameleon Twist 2 was developed by Japan System Supply and published by Sunsoft and focuses on many of the same gameplay aspects as its predecessor. Yet again, a chameleon named Davey and his friends find themselves trapped in a strange realm that transforms then into a humanoid-chameleon creature. At the beginning of the game, the same mysterious white rabbit that appeared in the first is the cause of all of this, however this time it does not involve traveling into a magical hole. Instead, the rabbit merely knocks one of the chameleons (whichever the player chooses to play as) into the sky, and they suddenly enter the other realm. The player must once again navigate through platform levels in order to achieve his ultimate goal of leaving this realm in the sky, and at the end of each stage is a boss that the player must defeat before moving on. Use of the chameleon's tongue is still necessary for fighting enemies and navigating the levels, and Chameleon Twist 2 also adds a parachute ability, that allows the player to fall at a slower pace, and vertical swinging polls, rather than solely the horizontal poles found in the first game. There is no multiplayer in this game, however.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Charlie Blast is a construction worker, but quite different than his more famous colleague. Charlie has a convincing beer belly, he has trouble keeping his jeans up (yup, you will get a nice view of his crack quite frequently) and his chest hair makes David Hasselhoff feel ashamed about himself. He is not trying to save a princess either; his mission is to blow islands up with TNT![CR]With 3D graphics and some platform elements, Charlie Blast's Territory, a remake of Kablooey, is a modernization of one of the classic puzzle genres where your goal is to push crates into the correct spots. [CR]Every level is an island. On every island you have at least one bomb and one TNT box. Your goal is to push all of them next to each others and then blow everything up in a huge chain reaction. When you do, you advance a level. You cannot pull the crates but you can climb over them.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Study Levels[CR]Pause the game in Puzzle mode. Change camera view with the C buttons.</plot>

		<plot>Let's Get Ready to Crumble![CR]Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable clay (!) fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and the legendary Earthworm Jim himself! It is the sequel to Clay Fighter 63 1/3 and famous for only being released as a Blockbuster rental exclusive.[CR]Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and a 2D-style fixed camera angle. You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either.[CR]Moves are a mix of standard punches &amp; kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands nor legs to begin with) and a large number of unique special moves and combos for all. You can sometimes interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the other side. You can also end the fights with Mortal Kombat-style "Claytalities".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Character Select Codes[CR]Enter the following codes at the Character Select menu. For the character codes, the cursor must be highlighting the "?" box.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Character Color[CR]First off highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and then quickly press C-Down. Now when your character goes out to fight he will appear in a different color.</plot>

		<title_clean>Command &amp; Conquer</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Base-building is at the heart of Command &amp; Conquer[CR]Command &amp; Conquer (also known as Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn) is a critically-acclaimed real-time strategy game developed by Westwood Studios and originally released in 1995. The first entry in the long-running Command &amp; Conquer franchise, it is often credited, along with Westwood's previous game Dune II and Blizzard's Warcraft II, with popularising the genre and establishing many genre conventions which persist to this day.[CR]Command &amp; Conquer is set in an alternate history 1995 and focuses on the conflict between the GDI, a multinational military organization, and the Brotherhood of NOD, an ancient and mysterious terrorist group lead by the enigmatic Kane. The two factions primarily vie for control of the mysterious substance Tiberium, which acts the as game's sole resource.[CR]The game was released as freeware on its 12th anniversary and can be downloaded from EA's official website.[CR]Factions[CR]Command &amp; Conquer documents the First Tiberium War, which pits the Global Defense Initiative (GDI), lead by General Mark Sheppard, against the Brotherhood of Nod, lead by Kane. Players can take control of either faction in the single-player campaign or multiplayer skirmishes.Global Defense Initiative (GDI)[CR]The Global Defense Initiative (GDI) is a military alliance of Western nations operating under the auspices of the UN Security Council. GDI commanders field an array of mostly conventional units, who fare well in a head-to-head confrontation but lack flexibility compared to Nod.[CR] [CR] Brotherhood of Nod[CR]The Brotherhood of Nod is an ancient and mysterious terrorist group devoted to its charismatic leader, Kane. Nod are masters of asymmetric warfare, with units that, while generally weaker than their GDI counterparts, excel in unconventional warfare.[CR] [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Command &amp; Conquer is well known for its mix of unintentionally hilarious FMV and CGI cut-scenes[CR]A mysterious alien plant-like crystal, named Tiberium, has been discovered by Doctor Ignatio Mobius on the banks of the river Tiber in Italy. Kane, leader of the secretive Brotherhood of Nod, disputes this, claiming that the substance was in fact first discovered by Nod, and named by Kane after the Emperor Tiberius. Tiberium Crystals are easy to harvest and full of potent elements, and so it rapidly becomes the most valuable mineral in existence. Both the Global Defense Initiative (GDI), and the Brotherhood of Nod begin harvesting Tiberium to fund their respective war efforts.[CR]Kane wants to spread Tiberium throughout the entire world, having humans accept it and live with it, all the while using it to create an army to rival that of the GDI. On the other hand, the GDI has found Tiberium to be deadly to humans and plans to remove it from Europe, while also using Tiberium as a resource to fund their war against Nod. The subsequent conflict between the GDI and Nod is known as the First Tiberium War.Endings[CR]The GDI campaign is considered canonical by subsequent games in the series.GDI[CR]At the end of game, GDI forces destroy the heart of the Nod empire at the Sarajevo Temple of Nod. The base can either be destroyed by an ORCA attack or by an Ion Cannon. In both cases, the final cut-scene show Kane inside the base as it's levelled, he is assumed to be dead.Nod[CR]In this ending, the Brotherhood of Nod successfully capture the codes to access the GDI's Ion Cannon. The player can then choose to destroy one of four historical world landmarks &#8212; the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, the White House or the Brandenburg Gate.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]GDI CharactersGeneral Mark SheppardGeneral Sheppard[CR]Supreme Commander of the GDI and hero of the First Tiberium War, General Sheppard played a pivotal role in defeating the Nod. During the game Sheppard is put in the spotlight after his forces are accused of a civilian massacre in Poland. Eventually, due to his persuasion and charisma, the charges are dropped and it is discovered that the whole event was fabricated by the Nod to discredit the GDI and cut of their funding. The plan backfire against the Nod and General Sheppard is able to lead the GDI to victory.Colonel J.C. CarterColonel Carter[CR]A GDI field commander who gives missions and briefings to the player. During the game, he plays a big role in battles taking place in Estonia in which he requires your assistance to overcome the Nod forces.M.O. MorelliM.O. Morelli[CR]Leader of the GDI air force and an experienced pilot, Morelli is a cool head who provides you a few missions during the game. In the First Tiberium War, she is responsible for helping you with the defense of Bialystok and recovering nuclear material from the Brotherhood of Nod.Dr. Ignatio MobiusDr. Mobius[CR]The world's foremost expert on Tiberium, Dr. Mobius was the first person to discover the mutagenous substance (a claim disputed by Kane). He is known to be quite a mad scientist and needs protection from Nod forces during the game.Nod CharactersKaneKane[CR]The Supreme Leader of the Brotherhood of Nod, Kane is a devious and ruthless man who will do anything to accomplish his goals. He believes that Tiberium is the future of mankind and that only Nod can harvest its true potential.SethSeth[CR]Second in command and Kane's right-hand man. In the campaign, Seth is your immediate superior and tasks you with most of your missions. As the game progresses, he becomes increasingly jealous of you and the attention you are getting from Kane for being so successful. Eventually, he tries to send you on a suicide mission to destroy the Pentagon but Kane steps in and shoots him. The player is then promoted to Seth's position.Greg BurdetteGreg Burdette[CR]A reporter working for the WWN network, Burdette is secretly working for the Nod. During the first Tiberium War, he films a report claiming that GDI troops slaughtered innocent civilians in Bialystok, Poland. In reality, the whole report was created behind a green screen under the guidance of Kane. The anti-GDI propaganda temporarily works and GDI's funding is cut by the UN.OthersFemale ReporterFemale Reporter[CR]An unnamed female reporter who appears at the end, newscasting the conclusion of the game on national television. Depending on the player's actions, the Female Reporter will broadcast different story on each play through. She talks in a very slow and off-beat tempo.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The CD cover[CR]The soundtrack is composed by Frank Klepacki and published by Westwood Studios. The double-CD soundtrack consists of 22 tracks with a combined duration of approximately 72 minutes. The soundtrack was bundled with some of the collector's editions of the game. On November 1, 2005, the soundtrack was made available on iTunes &#8212; fully remastered with some enhancements made in to each song (eg. extra vocals)."Act on Instinct" (2:45)"No Mercy" (3:21)"Industrial" (2:52)"Iron Fist" (3:29)"We Will Stop Them (Deception)" (3:07)"Radio" (2:59)"On the Prowl" (2:59)"Recon" (4:18)"Drone" (4:13)"In the Line of Fire" (2:02)"Prepare for Battle" (3:27)"Depth Charge" (4:12)"Rain in the Night" (2:34)"Creeping Upon" (3:39)"Target (Mechanical Man)" (2:49)"Just Do it Up (Just Do it)" (2:20)"C&amp;C Thang" (3:10)"To Be Feared" (2:41)"Drill" (4:28)"Full Stop (Warfare)" (5:02)"In Trouble" (3:07)"Air Strike" (3:11)[CR]System Requirements[CR]DOSWindowsProcessor: 486 DX2/66 or higherProcessor: Intel Pentium 60 MHzRAM: 8 MBRAM: 8 MBDisk Space: 30 MBDisk Space: 30 MBGraphics Card: VGA Video Card (320x200 pixels 256 colors)Graphics Card: 1MB Direct Draw compatible video card (640x480 pixels 256 colors)Sound Card: 100% Sound Blaster compatible sound cardSound Card: 100% DirectSound / Windows 95 compatible sound cardOS: MS-DOS 5.0 or higherOS: Windows 95 or higherCD Drive: Double SpeedCD Drive: Double Speed[CR]EVA Game Installer[CR]EVA Installer[CR]One unique feature of the DOS version of Command and Conquer was the game installer. In the game itself, the Electronic Video Agent (commonly referred to as EVA) is an AI which processes and conveys information to commanders on the battlefield. In the installer, EVA speaks to the player guiding them through the installation process as if they were connecting to a sophisticated military network.[CR]Parts of the final install process from installer was shown the first time the Windows 95 version was launched (the Windows 95 installer was a generic install Wizard though), and was part of the intro movie for the PlayStation version (which had no actual install at all). The sequence shown in these versions is a cutscene of the final files being copied to the system, and the computer linking up with the EVA command systems, as well as the words "Welcome, Commander", which became a recurring phrase throughout the main C&amp;C series.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Because of strict laws in Germany and the possibility of it being outlawed, all soldiers were replaced with robots which didn&#180;t spill red blood when killed and a different sound effect was added. All FMV was dubbed in German too.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes without a gameshark[CR]Enter the code on the third NOD mission, hold Z,L, and R and type the code[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock all levels for the GDI and NOD[CR]At the title screen, press B, A, R-shoulder, R-shoulder, A, C-right, Up, Down, A.

Anyway, after you do this(you must do it fast, before it goes into a demo), go into Replay Mission. Once there, press L-shoulder and voila! All the normal missions and som others.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Conker's Bad Fur Day was released on March 5th, 2001 for the Nintendo 64. Primarily designed by Chris Seavor (who also voiced Conker and the majority of the characters in the game), Bad Fur Day was a major tone change from previous platformers designed by Rare Studios, as it was designed for a mature audience, rather than young children. Many players were especially surprised with the game's mature theme given that the title was released on the N64, a platform that had garnered a reputation for being a more "kid-friendly" system than its rival, the Sony PlayStation.[CR]Rare also used Conker's Bad Fur Day to address many of the critical concerns made against their previous platformers, the Banjo- Kazooie franchise, as well as Donkey Kong 64. Critics argued that the games became overburdened by the player's need to collect too many items, losing the actual focus on tight gameplay and interesting levels in the process. To combat these claims, Conker's Bad Fur Day features no collectible items whatsoever. The game didn't even feature a real attack button. Instead, Conker would use "Context Sensitive" pads scattered throughout the level to instantly acquire the item or thing necessary to progress through the game.[CR]The significant amount of extreme content within the game, including use of severe profanity and violence, along with certain bodily functions, earned it a rating of BBFC 18 in the UK and Mature in the United States. There was some amount of censorship, including the blacking out of particularly gory parts of creatures or moments in the game. The words "Fuck" and "Cock" were censored by bleeps and symbols.[CR]The game is known for its many spoofs of multiple movies that were big around the time of the games release like The Matrix and Saving Private Ryan, as well as classics like A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, and The Terminator.[CR]Conker attacks his enemies normally by using a frying pan but also there are some context sensitive areas which will allow Conker to use a special power such as: peeing on flame monsters, attack a big furnace's brass balls with bricks, and more.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]At the start of the game, players meet Conker the Squirrel out drinking with his friends who are off to war the following morning. After the festivities, Conker stumbles out of the pub and tries to head home. Come sunrise, however, Conker awakens in a strange field with no recollection of the night's events. Breaking with tradition, the player begins the game with a staggering, hungover Conker, and must talk to a rather strange scarecrow named Birdy before receiving some milk to perk the squirrel up. Conker spends the entirety of the game searching for his home and trying to return to his girlfriend, Berri. Conker meets the Gregg the Grim Reaper, who tells him squirrels can have "as many lives as they can get away with", providing an explanation for the game's lives system; after all, it couldn't break from convention entirely.[CR]The Panther King wants to use Conker as a leg for his table, since one has gone missing. His disgruntled, wheelchair bound scientist, Professor von Kripplespak, meanwhile, begins plotting his revenge against his boss as he is sick of being ordered about so much. Little happens to advance this throughout the course of the game, but near the end, Conker and Berri are reunited and enlisted to work for Don Weaso, the Mafia boss. When the pair arrive at the vault they're instructed to rob, they find Weaso there with the Panther King and Professor von Kripplespak. Berri is shot to death by Weaso and Conker is made ready to be turned into a table leg. However, Professor von Kripplespak reveals there is a xenomorph inside the Panther King, which bursts forth from his chest and kills him. 'Von Kripplespak launches the safe into space, but Conker manages to isolate him within the air lock, launching him into the vacuum of space, allowing Conker to fight the xenomorph alone. As he is about to meet his doom at the hands of the xenomorph, the game "freezes" and Conker is allowed to ask the "programmer" for one thing. He chooses a katana and is transported back to the throne room where he kills his foe and is crowned king, in line with his vision at the start of the game. He would rather have had Berri back, however, and ambles back down to the pub where he gets drunk and stumbles off into the night again.[CR]Locations[CR]Conker's journey will take him through a series of bizarre locations and introduce him to a number of weird characters and bosses (most famously the Great Mighty Poo, an opera singing, living pile of excrement with sweetcorn for teeth). There were no real levels so to speak, as the game was essentially one large free-roaming area, with simple tasks to complete rather than the collection of items. The only real collectibles during the game are the wads of cash that Conker must retrieve in order to gain entry to a certain section later on. The locations themselves are well realized, including cold caverns, a clock tower, a prehistoric club, a caveman fighting arena, an enormous toilet bowl, a hill made entirely of shit, a farm, a beehive, a Batula's castle, a warzone and many others.[CR]Chapters[CR]The game followed a chapter based format, basically becoming "levels," the chapters weren't announced in the game, but they typically followed the levels, which also weren't really announced either (as is, there wasn't a portal that said "level one," things just blended together.) The chapters would also be used to replay areas of the game if they were unlocked from the main menu, eliminating the need to replay the entire game just to relive one moment. The chapters are as follows:[CR]Hung Over: Conker wakes up after wandering off in the wrong direction, waking up hung over in a strange world. He is greeted by a scarecrow named Birdy. This level is more of a tutorial.[CR]Windy: This is the "hub world," and so this chapter is actually considered to be ongoing throughout the adventure, because it shows up oh so many times. The first time, conker is charged with killing a bunch of wasps who have taken away the queen bee's hive.[CR]Barn Boys: This chapter follows Conker as he walks into a farm, comprised of talking blocks that want you to get rid of a mouse, a sexually suggestive flower, suicidal pitchforks, and a Terminator-type hay monster.[CR]Bats Tower: This chapter follows Conker working with Catfish to get some money, along the way, he helps a perverted Cog (with a gay Cog on his other side which takes control when Conker turns him over) who makes him put some ladies on his long pole, additionally, Conker gets to fight a boiler with some large steel balls, and parody jaws with a bulldog fish.[CR]Sloprano: Conker investigates the giant mountain of poo, gets cows to poop through a funnel so dung beetles can make him a dung ball, and fights the infamous Great Mighty Poo.[CR]Uga Buga: Conker convinces weasel guards that he's an elephant, and visits a nice but completely misplaced land of cavemen and dinosaurs, there he gets into private clubs, gets hired by the mafia, and fights in an arena to prove he's got the biggest bones of all.[CR]Spooky: Conker goes downstream during the night time and learns about the scary side of the world, where he helps a vampire get some blood off the weekly villager raid, and gets to fight off more zombies then you'd want to.[CR]It's War: War has broken out between the SHC (Squirrels) and the Tediz. Conker is enlisted, storms their beaches, and takes them all down single-handedly.[CR]Heist: Conker meets Barry again, gets re-hired by the Weasel mafia, and robs a bank all the while spoofing the Matrix.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Conker base mechanics don't differ wildly from Rare's other N64 platformers. Players can use a jump button to get Conker over obstacles, while a second tap of the button will give Conker an increased length of jump by utilising his bushy tail to hover for a few seconds. Camera controls are mapped to the C buttons on the N64 game pad.[CR]What makes Conker's Bad Fur Day interesting, however, is that the above accounts for the majority of Conker's gameplay mechanics. Rather than providing Conker with a slew of unique abilities, mapped to every single button the N64 controller (as in the Banjo-Kazooie games and Donkey Kong 64), Conker features an all purpose "Context Sensitive" button. All throughout the game world in Conker's Bad Fur Day, the player will encounter "B Pads", which ask that they push the button on the controller as a light-bulb appears over Conker's head (B's default action was to attack with his trusty frying pan). If this simple action is performed, Conker will magically pull out the item, vehicle or weapon necessary to progress through the game. The actions performed from the pads differ wildly from each other, but more often than not affect Conker's immediate surroundings. This feature (inspired in no small part by the Context Sensitive A button in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) put a greater emphasis on performing actions within the gameworld that would have a tangible effect on the area itself, rather than simply the collection of shiny objects that had no real impact within the world but allowed the player to progress (see Banjo's "Note Doors" and Mario 64's Star based progression). The Context Sensitive buttons kept the game focused on story, puzzles and gameplay, a welcome change for fans of the genre convinced that Rare's previous collect-a-thons were responsible for the decline of the 3-D platformer straight after its very rapid rise. It was certainly a new take on the platforming genre, and adult gamers welcomed a more mature (or immature as it may well be) take on the template.[CR]Some notable powerups are:Using toilet roll to defeat the Great Might Poo.Urinating on angry Rock Men.A catapult.Activating a trough of prune juice to make cows defecate.[CR]Conker additionally competes in a number of challenges that aren't in line with the rest of the game's style of play. For instance, he has to ride a bull hitting targets, a raptor as it eats cavemen and pilots a hoverboard in a race. He is also transformed into a blood sucking bat in the Vampire's castle.[CR]The game was also notable for its large number of novel and well constructed movie parodies. Players would engage in sequences directly inspired by The Terminator, Reservoir Dogs, The Untouchables, The Wizard of Oz, The Godfather, Eyes Wide Shut, Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, Dracula, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, Blue Velvet, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Alien, Full Metal Jacket, Scarface, The Matrix and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, among other references.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]In the multiplayer portion of the game you can play in a variety of modes.Tanks - Simple, you have a tank and on the map are various power-ups to kill other tanks easier, and faster. In the center of the map is a can of gas, your objective is to place the can of gas in a bunker to kill everyone who is outside . The exciting part of this mode is that once the gas has been released it becomes one big game of musical chairs to see who can find a bunker to live.War - Two bases stand off from one another-one for the Tediz and one for the Squirrels. This mode also features a can of gas in each sides base. The mode plays basically like capture the flag with the same rush-to-get-to-a-safe-zone found in tanks.Race - In race you play cavemen who have hoverboards and race over giant lava rivers. This mode features basic racing format with three laps (or a time limit) and various ramps and weapons.Heist - In Heist, you play a game like neutral capture the flag, but instead of a flag, the game has a bag of money. The player's objective is to get the bag of money and manage to take it back to your color base to score. This mode manages to be fun with tons of weaponry and a nice large level.Raptor - In Raptor you play a caveman who must sneak into a velociraptor nest, steal an egg, and run with the egg back to your base where you drop it in a giant frying pan. The problem here is that you must avoid the angry mother velociraptor. Luckily you are armed with crossbows, throwing knives, and clubs to deal with the raptors.Beach - In Beach you can play as either Squirrel Frenchman or Tediz Soldiers. As the Squirrels you must charge the beach avoiding fire from the Tediz and make it to the other side of the map. As the Tediz you must prevent the Squirrels from making it through the map.Capture the Flag - Finally the dedicated CTF, this is simple. The sad thing is Rare didn't bother to put any neat spin on this mode as they did with the others. The map is rather small but very frantic.Deathmatch - Deathmatch is a basic kill-your-enemies mode. The neat thing about deathmatch is you can play it on seven different maps in the game one from every other mode.[CR]Development[CR]Conker's Bad Fur Day was initially a standard platformer, echoing the likes of Rare's Banjo games and Mario 64. It was called Conker's Quest and later, Twelve Tails: Conker 64. This version was much cuter and "kiddy-oriented", featuring none of the features that truly made Conker stand out from the crowd. Trailers for the game were met with a muted reception at E3, as this would be the third similar Rare franchise on a console already rife with platforming titles to choose from. Rare themselves realized this, and decided to redo the entire experience. Inspired by the cute looking but adult cartoon, South Park, Chris Seavor, the game's producer, thought taking the game to more mature and controversial territory would be an interesting direction to go in. Thus, the team announced they'd be making the Conker's Bad Fur Day we know today, and work on the project began in earnest. Initially, gamers didn't believe Rare's decision, claiming it was an April fool's joke.[CR]Xbox Version[CR]In 2004, an Xbox version titled Conker: Live and Reloaded was released. It contained an enhanced (though more heavily censored) version of the original game, plus a whole new online component. It was well liked by the game press, though less adored than the original release, possibly because of the slightly aged nature of the game and the fairly bog-standard shooting of the multiplayer.[CR]The Great Mighty Poo's Song[CR]The Great Mighty Poo[CR]I am the Great Mighty Poo and I&#8217;m going to throw my shit at you.[CR]A huge supply of tish comes from my chocolate starfish.[CR]How about some scat, you little twat?[CR]Do you really think you&#8217;ll survive in here?[CR]You don&#8217;t seem to know which creek you&#8217;re in.[CR]Sweet corn is the only thing that makes it through my rear.[CR]How do you think I keep this lovely grin?[CR]Have some more caviar.[CR]Now I&#8217;m really getting rather mad.[CR]You&#8217;re like a niggly, tickly, shitty little tag nut.[CR]When I&#8217;ve knocked you out with all my bab[CR]I&#8217;m going to take your head and ram it up my butt. "Your butt?" (Conker) My butt! "Your butt?" That's right my butt! "Ewww." My buuuuuuutt![CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]1) Conker the King2:122) Windy &amp; Co.8:513) Beardy erm, Birdy1:284) Poo3:405) Ole!!!3:256) The Old Chap1:197) Sloprano4:428) The Uggas4:169) Rock Solid6:1610) Don Weazo2:0911) Surf Punks2:1212) Bats5:4513) Undead3:1514) War0:5215) Exit the Beach1:4516) Enter the Vertex2:0817) Conker the King (Reprise)5:2218) Heist4:08[CR]Scrapped Ending[CR]The game was supposed to have a much darker ending, Conker was originally at the end of the game in the pub, walk up to a mirror, burst into tears, pull out a gun and aim it at his head. The screen would then fade to black and we would hear a gunshot, so in other words, he committed suicide. However that ending was scrapped as it did not really leave much room for a sequel, so instead we have an ending that is more open. Ironically, when Chris Seavour was asked about a Conker sequel, he said it would focus on the evil Tediz and Conker would have been killed in the first scene.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 50 Lives[CR]Go to the cheat menu and enter the code.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy game controls and difficulty:[CR]Enter EASY as a code. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Aiming Laser with Throwing Knives[CR]The aiming laser glitch can be activated in the multiplayer game ''raptor''. Find a cross bow and stand beside some throwing knives. Go into aiming mode, turn on the aiming laser and side-step onto the knives. When you take out the knives there should be a laser pointing at the last spot that you aimed at. This trick is especially useful in navigating the map because you can aim the laser at your base and if you are lost all you have to do is follow the laser back to safety. If the trick does not work exit the current game and start a new one. Also you should avoid using the cross-bow while the glitch is active because then it will reset.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Banjo and Kazooie Cameo[CR]Banjo and Kazooie, from the popular Rare game "Banjo-Kazooie" make a cameo in Conker's Bad Fur Day at the bar. However, they've seen better days. Banjo's head is mounted above the fire place and Kazooie has been turned into an umbrella in the closet.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 10 Hidden Lives[CR]In the second area of the game "Barn Boys", make your way to the cheese ranch, and jump up to the back wall. Start on the left, and make your way towards the middle of the rock formation. During one of the jumps, a light bulb will appear, so press the B button and Conker will become an anvil and smash the rock below. It will open a hidden cave and reveal a normal squirrel tail, but this "special" tail will give you 10 lives instead of 1.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Being the first installment in Midway and Nintendo's Cruisn' series, Cruisn' USA was first introduced in 1994 as an arcade title. The main concept behind the game is to race across the country using one of seven available cars by successfully completing a series of one-directional tracks that bear landmarks or vague similarities found in particular locations within the United States, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the White House. With each stage you complete, your progress is shown on a map of your route, which includes stops along U.S. Route 101, Interstate 40, Interstate 25, Interstate 90, Interstate 80, and Interstate 70. However, while Interstate 25 is portrayed as part of the route a player will partake according to the progress map, the highway is actually not depicted in any of the stages.[CR]Nintendo 64[CR]In 1995, Nintendo announced the development of the game for the upcoming Nintendo 64 (back when it was referred to as the Ultra 64) with intentions of having the game act and play exactly the same as the arcade version and to be available for the Nintendo 64's launch later that year, however the console launch would eventually be delayed until fall 1996. The home port, developed by Williams, ultimately missed the console's launch. When it was released in late 1996, the game was met with harsh and negative reviews. What was once state of the art in 94 was no longer , worst still  the console version of the game was considerably downgraded, particularly with the visuals and the games audio. This can be pinned on the fact that the game didn't run on Ultra 64 hardware, but instead on the Midway V Unit hardware. The V Unit would also power the sequel, Cruis'n World, as well as Off Road Challenge and War Gods.[CR]Furthermore, various adjustments due to censorship and copyright issues within the console release include a more covered trophy girl, billboard advertisement removals (such as a Corn Pops billboard in the Golden Gate Park stage), and a new Bill Clinton-less scene upon completing the Cruise the USA mode.[CR]There were a few additions to the home port. Split-screen multiplayer was added, and when the Cruse the USA mode was completed with a car on a certain difficulty, a bonus car was added with a different color and a higher top speed.[CR]Wii Virtual Console[CR]Cruis'n USA became the first third-party developed Nintendo 64 game released on Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console service on March 28, 2008 in Europe and on March 31, 2008 in North America. The Virtual Console version is essentially exactly the same as the Nintendo 64 version with exception to the removal of the Hollywood sign within the Beverly Hills stage.[CR]Cars[CR]&#8217;63 Muscle CarBased on the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette C2 Sting RayLa BambaBased on a pastache of 1930's hot rods, mainly the '32 Ford.Devastator IVBears similarities to the Jaguar XK220Italia P69Based on the Ferrari TestarossaAll-Terrain VehicleBased on the Jeep WranglerHidden car, hold the view buttons (C-buttons for the Nintendo 64) over the '63 Muscle Car to use itSchool BusBears similarities to a Carpenter conventional school busHidden car, hold the view buttons (C-buttons for the Nintendo 64) over the La Bamba to use itPolice CarBased on the fourth generation Chevrolet CapriceHidden car, hold the view buttons (C-buttons for the Nintendo 64) over the Devastator IV to use it[CR]Tracks[CR]Golden Gate ParkLevel: EasyLandmarks: Golden Gate BridgeSan FranciscoLevel: ExpertLandmarks: Park Presidio Blvd.US 101Level: EasyRedwood ForestLevel: ExpertBeverly HillsLevel: MediumLA FreewayLevel: EasyDeath ValleyLevel: MediumArizonaLevel: EasyGrand CanyonLevel: ExpertLandmarks: Grand Canyon, Mount RushmoreIowaLevel: MediumLandmarks: Gateway ArchChicagoLevel: ExpertIndianaLevel: MediumAppalachiaLevel: MediumWashington DCLandmarks: The White House[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 3 New Cars[CR]On the car selection screen, hold the top, bottom, and left C buttons.

		<title_clean>Cruis'n World</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Cruis'n World is the sequel to the 1994 arcade racing game, "Cruis'n USA. In Cruis'n World, the player races on various tracks modeled around the world. Cruis'n World, also has more cars to choose from than Cruis'n USA. In 1998, Cruis'n World was released onto the Nintendo 64 due to its success, and being the best received of the Cruis'n games.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A new feature introduced in Cruis'n World was stunts. Stunts were used to dodge obstacles, maneuver around tight curves, or just for the joy of watching your car spinning through the air. If the stunt made your car fly through the air, you would also be awarded with a few extra seconds to the clock. Do do a stunt, you would simply need to drive over a ramp.[CR]If you were successful in races, you would be allowed to make slight upgrades to your car such as boost rockets, and you were also able to paint your cars, add stripes, and apply decals to them. You would be able to improve your vehicle as you progressed, so changing cars was not always necessary.[CR]Cruis'n World allowed for split-screen multiplayer so you and up to three friends could play together.[CR]Courses[CR]Artists were sent around the world to digitally capture tourist attractions and sights around the world to give their game a more realistic feeling. Events in places like Kenya would even have animals wandering around the track.[CR]The following are the available tracks in Cruis'n World:[CR]- Germany[CR]- Egypt[CR]- Hawaii[CR]- New York[CR]- England[CR]- France[CR]- Kenya[CR]- Italy[CR]- China[CR]- Australia[CR]- Mexico[CR]- Russia[CR]- Japan[CR]- Florida[CR]- The Moon (Only available on N64)[CR]Cars[CR]The following are the drivable vehicles in both version of Cruis'n World:- Kamikaze AWD (Toyota Supra Mark IV)- Stallion P56 (Ferrari 456)- Scarab (Volkswagen Beetle)- Banzai GTV (Mitsubishi 3000GT)- Rhino 4x4 (Dodge Ram)- Gimpee (Daihatsu Hijet)- Serpent (Dodge Viper)- Zombi XXX (1994 Ford Mustang)- Road King (Kenworth semi truck)- Orca (Porsche 993)- Sardine Extreme (Daihatsu Midget)- ATV (Humvee)The following vehicles were added to the N64 version:- Ambulance- Bulldog- Conductor- Enforcer- Exec- Grass Hopper- Howler- Monsta- Rocket- Skool Bus- Speed Demon- Taxi- Tommy[CR]Differences between the Arcade version and the N64 version of Cruis'n World[CR]Cruis'n World on the Nintendo 64 was not a direct port of the arcade version. Some features were added into the N64 version of the game while other features were left out.[CR]The following are the differences between the two versions:- The Nintendo 64 version of Cruis'n World did not feature as many voice clips during certain stages as the arcade version. It is not known why this was doneThe Nintendo 64 version added 13 additional cars (all traffic cars from the Arcade version) which could be unlocked from the time-trial mode.- In the Arcade Version of Cruis'n World, animals would explode into bloody chunks when you hit them, while on the N64 version if you attempt to hit an animal, it would either run out of the way or you would just drive straight through it. This was probable done to keep the game from getting a "Teen" rating.- The Nintendo 64 version of Cruis'n World gives the player the ability to race in a tournament mode(campaign), Save Data Back to the ROM cartridge, and give the car custom boosts and paint jobs.- The Nintendo 64 version of Cruis'n World supported up to 4-player splitscreen. The Arcade version supported up to 4-player simultaneous with connected cabinets.-In the arcade version of Cruis'n World, the steering wheel would provide resistance if you crashed into something. The Nintendo 64 version replaced this with rumble pack support.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change paint job[CR]When you select your car, use the L and R buttons to change the paint job.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Moon Track[CR]Complete the game on ''Cruise The World'' mode under the easy difficulty level. A sequence showing your car being transported to the moon will be shown. The bonus moon track may now be accessed after the credits. [CR]</plot>

Custom Robo puts you in the pilot's seat of a state-of-the-art war machine in the not-too-distant future where crime and justice duke it out in virtual battlegrounds. With the game's powerful, innovative customization, you can construct your robot from the ground up using an arsenal of more than 200 parts and weapons, from guns and bombs to robo models and homing pods. Many weapons are freely available on the market, but some--deadly and highly illegal--can only be acquired in secret robo gambling rooms and from the hands of crime syndicates.</plot>

Distributed only in Japan, Disney Dancing Museum was still packaged with the series' trademark dance pads. However, because of the storage capacity limitations of Nintendo 64 cartridges, the song list had to be compromised in quantity compared to its counterparts on the PlayStation. Additionally, similar to other tie-in games in the franchise such as Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix, the difficulty was tuned in order to address an audience which was believed to be less hardcore and familiar with Dance Dance Revolution's mechanics.[CR]Song List[CR]Mickey Mouse March It's a Small World Mickey Motion Jiwaku No Tango Tap!

		<plot>Dezaemon 3D is more of a game creator than an actual game. While it ships with two games, what really makes the cartridge special is the editor. It is far more than a level editor - you can use it to design your own 3D shooting game! In fact, both games were done with the very same editor. [CR]Designing 3D models, doing textures and composing a hit song are no small tasks mind you, so if you are more of the impatient type, you can skip the editor and head straight for the two sample games, Solid Gear and Usagi. Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. [CR]Solid Gear is a "serious" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. [CR]Usagi is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles.. and bunnies. A whole lot of bunnies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Mode cheats[CR]Select the ''Game mode'' option at the main menu. Move the pointer over the picture of the game pak, then press the following:</plot>

		<title_clean>Diddy Kong Racing</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game for the Nintendo 64, developed by Rareware and released in 1997. Diddy Kong racing made its way into the Guinness Book of World Records due to a staggering 800,000 copies being ordered in the two weeks prior to Christmas 1997. Diddy Kong racing allows the player to choose between three vehicles; car, hovercraft and plane and includes Adventure, Battle and Racing modes in a similar style to Mario Kart 64.Character select menu[CR]In Adventure mode, Diddy Kong receives a distress call from one of his friends, Timber the Tiger. Timber's parents have gone on vacation and left him in charge of the usually peaceful island they live on. However, unfortunately for Timber and his friends, an evil pig wizard from outer space called Wizpig has dropped in to ruin Timber's fun. Wizpig wants to take over Timber's Island and claim it as his own by conquering all of the island's race tracks, as he has done on his home planet Future Fun Land. Hearing the news, Diddy Kong recruits his friends Banjo the bear and Conker the squirrel (this game is actually the first appearance of Conker and Banjo, though Kazooie had yet to be created) and heads over to Timber's Island whilst Timber enlists the remaining inhabitants of the island. They then join forces to go up against the evil Wizpig. Wizpig, however, has been doing some recruitment of his own, and has turned the islands four guardians Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon into his henchmen. He also turned veteran racer Drumstick into a frog that looks just a little bit like a rooster. Diddy and his friends must race against Wizpig and his friends and complete all of their challenges to prevent Wizpig taking over the island for good. Drumstick is eventually turned back into a proper rooster.The evil Wizpig[CR]The gameplay takes place in various worlds on the island, each containing several race tracks, a battle stage and race against one of Wizpig's henchmen. A golden balloon is awarded after each race won and the player must collect a certain number of golden balloons to progress to the next stage. Some golden balloons can be found in the hub world that connects the game's areas. Diddy and his friends must eventually defeat Wizpig in a race, causing him to flee back to his home planet Future Fun Land. Uncertain that Wizpig won't return to try and take over the island again the characters follow him to his home planet for the final showdown where victory blasts Wizpig off on a rocket into distant space never to be seen again.Silver Coin Challenges[CR]In order to extend the length of the game (and add more difficulty) after beating races the first time, the player must go and complete Silver Coin Challenges. These take place on the same tracks, but the player must collect eight Silver Coins hidden throughout the tracks, and win. Of course these coins are not simply sitting in the middle of the track, and many involve going well out of the way to collect.Mirror Mode[CR]Completing Adventure Mode once unlocks a new mode where all of the courses in the game are mirrored, and the player must complete them all again. This includes the aforementioned Silver Coin Challenges.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]PlayableKrunch the big male KremlingDiddy Kong the "Chimpanzee"Drumstick the Big Rooster (unlockable)Bumper the BadgerBanjo the BearConker the SquirrelTiptup the TurtleT.T. the Stopwatch (unlockable)Pipsy the MouseTimber the TigerNon PlayableTaj the GenieWizpig the giant alien PigTricky the TriceratopsBluey the WalrusBubbler the OctopusSmokey the DragonTaj the elephant genie who helps you out throughout the game.[CR]Game Areas[CR]The open world was split into five game areas, each with four tracks, a boss event, and a multplayer combat minigame.[CR]Dino DomainAncient LakeFossil CannonJungle FallsHot Top VolcanoBoss: Tricky the Triceratops[CR]Snowflake MountainEverfrost PeakWalrus CoveSnowball ValleyFrosty VillageBoss: Bluey the Walrus[CR]Sherbert IslandWhale BayCrescent IslandPirate LagoonTreasure CavesBoss: Bubbler the Octopus[CR]Dragon ForestWindmill PlainsGreenwood VillageBoulder CanyonHaunted WoodsBoss: Smokey the Dragon[CR]Future Fun Land (Accessible after beating Wizpig the first time)Spacedust AlleyDarkmoon CavernsSpaceport AlphaStar CityBoss: Wizpig[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Misc.

Rapidly press the gas button, and you will build up speed to about 90 regardless of the character. Note: This only works with the car.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Adventure 2[CR]Get the four original trophies, to unlock the secret world. In this world, get all the baloons, and the final trophy. (Giving you 47 baloons, and 5 trophies). Take on Wizpig (the one in the fifth world, future fun land).  [CR]When you win, you'll unlock the ''Adventure Two'' option. In this mode, you collect silver colored baloons, and all the courses are mirrored. In addition, you can now choose to play a course in ''Adventure'' or ''Adventure 2'' mode, in the track mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Developers Times[CR]Defeat Wizpig for the second time. After the ending and credits, a series of times will be listed. These times are the best times recorded (in Time Trial mode) by Nintendo and Rare staff during the production of the game.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Title screen[CR]Donkey Kong 64 is a game by Rare for the Nintendo 64. The first 3D platformer Rare created after Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64 featured higher resolution textures and graphics (thanks to the N64 dual ram "Expansion Pack" that was included with the game), but also featured more collection quests and more items to collect.[CR]It is regarded as one of the biggest and longest single player video games ever created, due to it's very large amount of collectibles and missions for the player to complete.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Going out![CR]Donkey Kong 64 is a 3-D platformer where players guide all five members of the "Kong family" (including Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong) to recollect their horde of Golden Bananas. Each Kong has their own abilities and characteristics, as well as their own unique collectibles, meaning each world has five different sets of collectible items.[CR]The Golden Bananas have been hidden across eight unique worlds. On each world there are five golden bananas for each Kong to collect and a boss to be defeated. In order to open the door that locks the boss the players need to gather as many regular bananas as possible and feed them to a hippopotamus that guards the door.[CR]When defeating the boss the Kongs will get a golden key that will allow them to help a giant Kremlin &#8211; K. Lumsy &#8211; who has been locked up by King K. Rool. When using the key to unlock part of his cage, K. Lumsy will jump with joy and cause an earthquake that will open the following world. When reaching the entrance to another world, the player will use the Golden Bananas to finally gain entrance to a new area. Exploring the world.[CR]The worlds are filled with different challenges that will make use of all of the Kongs' many abilities. Some mini-games can also be found within each world, the reward earned for beating them is usually a Golden Banana.[CR]On their adventure, the players are aided by other famous members of the Kong family such as Funky (who provides guns for all the five Kongs), Candy (who teaches them how to play different instruments), and Cranky (who will give potions that will make the Kongs learn new moves).[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR] The Kremlings try to steer their oversized ship.[CR]K. Rool has an evil plan to destroy all the Kongs, and their island, using a massive laser called the "Blast-O-Matic." But, due to his clumsy Kremlins, his ship crashes on a big rock in the ocean, which causes his weapon to malfunction.[CR]He sends his underlings to lock-away some of the Kongs, and steal Donkey Kong&#8217;s banana hoard once again, in order to have time to fix his weapon and attain his goal.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Playable CharactersThe D.K crew[CR] Donkey Kong &#8211; The initial character and the most balanced of all the Kongs, he uses a coconut gun as a weapon and plays the bongos.[CR] Diddy Kong &#8211; He is not very strong but he is fairly quick, and he can perform long jumps.

The main complaint was that the game presented too many things to collect and that it was simply too long.[CR]However, many praised the amazing graphics which were generated with the help of the expansion pack. The game was also praised for it's large amount of content.[CR]DK Rap[CR]Screen capture from the DK rap[CR]The DK Rap was a rather long and catchy tune played at the beginning of the game before the menu screen. The rap featured brief descriptions of each character, and the use of the word "hell".While the rap and accompanying cutscene was almost assuredly meant as tongue in cheek the bizarre nature of it has nonetheless made the DK Rap somewhat of an injoke among fans of the series.Lyrics[CR]He-He-Here we go![CR]So they're finally here,[CR]Performin' for you.[CR]If you know the words[CR]you can join in too.[CR]Put your hands together,[CR]If you want to clap,[CR]As we take you through,[CR]This Monkey Rap.[CR]HUH![CR]D-K, Donkey Kong.[CR]He's the leader of the bunch,[CR]You know him well,[CR]He's finally back,[CR]To kick some tail.[CR]His coconut gun,[CR]Can fire in spurts,[CR]If he shoots ya,[CR]Its gonna hurt![CR]He's bigger, faster,[CR]And stronger too.[CR]He's the first member,[CR]Of the D.K.

However, if you're running low on instrument power, and you want to use it to kill the enemies in the vicinity but not trigger the event (i.e. in Angry Aztec, if you want to kill the Kremling outside the temple but don't want the bird to swoop down and pick you up), simply stand on the rim of the pad and play your tune. This will trick the game into allowing you to perform the move for free, but not trigger the event.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Donkey Kong Arcade Game[CR]Located in Frantic Factory, is the original Arcade machine. To activate the lever, complete the blast barrel course located in the level. Then use your B move (Gorilla Grab) to activate the Arcade machine. Complete the Arcade game twice to get the Nintendo Coin.  [CR]Once you have 6 Banana fairies, this game will be available to play from the Mystery menu. It is one of those games which cycles through the four levels, getting harder and harder. Good luck. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Test Area[CR]Go to the minigame selection screen in Snide's HQ (needs to be unlocked first) and hit A and B at the same time.  If done right, you should be brought to a secret area that the developers probably used to test out the game mechanics.  If you try to run out of this area, you will just be warped back to the starting point.  So to leave this area, you must reset the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Ending[CR]To get a special ending, collect all 201 gold bananas then beat King K. Rool. [CR]You will not be able to view this extra video clip in the DK Theatre though.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's opening sequence.[CR]Doom 64 is a first-person shooter developed and published by Midway for the Nintendo 64 on April 1, 1997. Unlike other console ports of the Doom series, Doom 64 features all-new original content (including 32 new levels and redone graphics). While most of the enemies and weapons remain the same, the game includes new enemies (such as the Nightmare Imp) and new weapons (such as the Unmaker, a powerful laser whose power can be increased by finding each of three ancient artifacts hidden in secret stages throughout the game). Certain enemies were left out of the game as a matter of saving space on the cartridge, these were the Commando, Arch-Vile, Spider Mastermind, and the Revenant. The game carried over the music and sound effects from the PlayStation version of The Ultimate Doom, which were far more atmospheric and ambient compared to the rock and heavy metal music composed for the earlier games by Bobby Prince.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game takes place after the events of Doom II: Hell on Earth, after a nameless space marine wiped out the demons on Earth. While bombarding the bases on Phobos and Deimos with extreme radiation (in hopes of killing off the remaining demons there), the military failed to notice a mysterious entity slipping through (which began to resurrect all demons it came across, making them stronger as a result). As the only soldier with any experience in dealing with the demon hordes, the player is sent back to these bases with orders to wipe out this entity and the hellish demons once and for all.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Dr. Mario 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dr. Mario 64 is puzzle game. Developed by Newcom and published by Nintendo, it was released April 9th 2001 in North America and November 2003 in China. The game was released on both the Nintendo 64 and iQue.Nintendo Puzzle Collection includes a version of Dr. Mario 64[CR]Because there was no Japanese version of Dr. Mario 64, the version of Dr. Mario included in Nintendo Puzzle Collection on the Nintendo GameCube is a port of the North American version of the game. There are a few new things in the game, including new music and secret characters. The game is never referenced to as Dr. Mario 64, but rather Dr. Mario (and any references to the Nintendo 64 in the game itself are removed).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The flu season is in and seeing as Mario is a doctor, he must help cure the disease with his Megavitamins. But before long Wario steals his Megavitamins and in such causes Mario to go after him, but before Mario can get his Megavitamins back, Mad Scienstein and Rudy the clown steal the Megavitamins from Wario. Mario and Wario set out on seperate paths to get the Megavitamins back for both there own causes they encounter each other and numerous monsters from the Wario Land universe.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dr. Mario 64 plays similarly to other games in the Dr. Mario franchise.[CR]Like any drop down puzzle game, Dr. Mario requires the player to line up certain colors so that the blocks can removed to create more space. To remove blocks, no more than a minimum of four of the same color must be connected to make them disappear. These include the Red Virus (Fever), the Blue Virus (Chill), and the Yellow Virus (Weird); with a Megavitamin color designed to kill them. Dr. Mario 64 includes different gameplay modes these are as follows, Classic mode, which features a similar set-up and design to earlier Dr. Mario video games. Story mode, in which the player may take control of either Dr. Mario or Wario to track down the stolen Megavitamins, battling computer players along the way. Another mode pits the player against the computer as any character the player has played as or fought against. Up to four players may play at once in the multiplayer mode, which is designed similarly to the CPU Vs. mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Vampire Wario[CR]To unlock Vampire Wario as a playable character in Versus mode, complete Story mode on Normal or higher difficulty using Dr. Mario, but without losing a single time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Increase Computer Difficulty[CR]When selecting a computer opponent in Vs. Computer mode, hold the L button and press A to make his difficulty one star harder (the equivalent of Hard level). [CR]By holding L and pressing B, the computer player's difficulty increases two stars (the equivalent of S-Hard level).</plot>

		<title_clean>Duke Nukem - Zero Hour</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zero Hour Title Screen[CR]Duke Nukem Zero Hour is a third person shooter adaptation of the popular adult themed Duke Nukem saga. Much like Duke Nukem: Time to Kill, this was the second game in the series to go third person. Many fans skipped buying Zero Hour in wait of the true sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever, but D.N.F was later delayed until 2004, and has seen its production halted due to financial issues and subsequent shut down of 3D Realms.[CR]*The Duke Nukem rights were then purchased by Gearbox and D.N.F was finally released June 14, 2011.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Destroyed Statue of Liberty[CR]This time around Duke Nukem is called out by the United States government, as the Earth is being invaded by hordes of aliens. Duke is called in to assist in the fighting off of the invading forces. Early on, Duke Nukem fights his way through the now war consumed New York City, alongside U.S. Marines until he arrives at the alien stronghold near the collapsed Statue of Liberty. Here, Duke Nukem discovers that the aliens are using time travel to go back in time and mess around with famous human events to cause humanity to weaken, therefore making their invasion of current day Earth much easier. Meanwhile, Duke continues to fight in current day New York, but is teleported into the future by an alien battle-lord.[CR]In the future, players are greeted by an ugly post- apocalyptic world where the only surviving human beings are zombies and mutants and lumber about the wasteland. The World is war consumed and Duke Nukem fights his way through the wasteland until he locates a Resistance group. Together, Duke and the freedom fighters cooperate to fight the alien oppressors. They fight in future New York in search of the old U.S. Army command center, there, the resistance and the remains of the U.N. had made their own portal to go back and fix the past to restore humanity.Duke Fighting Zombies[CR]Duke Nukem jumps back in time to the Wild West era in the 1800s and later goes to Victorian England in the 1700s. Here Zombies litter the streets and brains and intestines flood the city. Duke assaults a castle and kills one of the Alien overlords. In a final push, Duke returns to the modern day New York to finish off the Alien Commander, Zero. Duke enters the alien mother ship and kicks zero's alien ass. Duke Nukem once again saves Earth and prepares for some much needed R&amp;R.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Mean StreetsPrecinct Parking GaragThe Streets of New YorkDuke BurgerThe Road to Trans-tek ElectricityThe HotelDuke Burger 2The SubwayLiberty or DeathAt the Base of the StatueInto the DuctGetting the Control KeyUnlocking the Control Key DoorGoing After the Pump Station KeyThe Pump StationGetting the Service Elevator PassThe Visitor's CenterActivating the Elevatorsn the Head[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Modern Day and Futuristic WeaponsBlaster PistolClaw 12 Pump action shotgunTwin SMGsAGL-9 Grenade LauncherPipe BombFreezerScatter LaserHavocPulse CannonLaser TripmineVintage WeaponsRevolverSawed-Off Shotgun.30-.30 RifleGatling GunVolt cannonT.N.T[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Duke Nukem 3D makes its way to the N64 for the first time, with plenty of new additions:[CR]Weapons: New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.[CR]Presentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).[CR]However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.[CR]A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Codes All Versions![CR]At the title screen, enter any of the following codes:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Refill Health[CR]Shoot a fire hydrant or a toilet and press B next to it repeatedly to gain back your health.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 3D was the latest game in the series to appear on consoles. It is the third game in the series and was created by Interplay, and was more aimed toward the television series rather than the previous games in the series. Earthworm Jim 3D was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and PC, also a PlayStaion version was announced, but got cancelled.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim blasting an enemy.[CR]Earthworm Jim 3D is played similar to other 3D platformer games in that time, such as Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64.[CR]The player will control Earthworm Jim and kill enemies while containing many platforming elements. You play through different levels, and unlock more locations by collecting Golden Udders, while new levels in each locatain can be obtained by collecting Jim's Marbles. Like in previous Earthworm Jim games, Your primary weapon will be your blaster gun.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim is struck by a cow flying through the air, and is then induced in a coma. Jim awakes in his mind and becomes crazy. Jim's previous enemies are also in his mind, and if not defeated, Jim will be stuck in his coma forever. He has unleashed his super ego to stop the madness happening in his mind. Jim must collect all of the Golden Udders to restore his sanity.  As you travel around his own mind, Jim has four area to explore in order to restore his health (and more importantly, his sanity). The four areas Jim must explore is also where he must collect his marbles, which, not only determines how smart Jim really is, but can unlock future levels by collecting a certain amount of marbles. With this in mind, Jim must travel deeper into his mind to get rid of his enemies.  The first area Jim explores is his Memory, along with his old foe, Psycrow. Inside Jim relives his early childhood of a war and other manly things a worm must remember. Collecting all the Golden Udders in this area allows Jim to travel into another part of his just after he defeats Psycrow in a good, old fashioned Pig Surfing contest. Jim must collect 100 marbles before Psycrow in order to win (and all the boss battles are this way as well so it's good to practice now while you get the chance). A big catch is that you have to watch your health at the same time so it's best not to get hit with anything and hope that you can collect everything before Psycrow does.  The second area Jim must explore is his Happiness. In here, nothing but food and anything Jim really loves the most is in this part of his brain. However, another foe is around here as well and that would be Fatty Roswell, an alien with an obvious problem of eating way too much, with a goal to make Jim's mind the perfect place to dine forever. A tough boss to crack as he has the ability to teleport around the area, making it hard to collect all the marbles to win.  Jim swallows his pride and sticks his chest out, the next area he must face is his Fear. Everything that he fears the most can be found in this area and adds even more rooms then the previous area, just to see Jim wet himself. In here, he must face ghost chickens and dancing zombies in order to restore his sanity. Another foe is lurking in the darkness and that is Professor Monkey for a Head and his never ending quest to torture poor Jim forever using his greatest fears.  Just when you think Jim can't do much else at this point, he must then travel into his Fantasy, where growing up as a worm, he will be the Worm of the West and stop the bandits from harming his mind anymore. His last foe in this part of his mind is Bob the Goldfish and Number 4 (a cat) who will stop at nothing to make sure Jim doesn't restore his sanity and leave him trapped in a coma forever.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Earthworm Kim[CR]To play as Earthworm Kim (the last boss), collect 1000 marbles and beat the game. You should have a "Smart Superhero" rank if you collected all the marbles. Now, start your file, go to the "Fear" world and enter the door with the clock outside. Once inside, go straight ahead to the green barred gate. The game should automatically reset itself, and you'll be able to load your save file as Earthworm Kim.</plot>

Players are given spoken instructions about every mini game by Sesame Street characters. The player controls Elmo in several mini games, ranging from scuba diving to vehicle driving, with the objective of collecting assigned letters in each level. Each time the player collects a letter, this letter will be uttered by a character, helping children to associate the written form of each letter to its spoken form. Players are encouraged to explore different settings, from outer space to underwater worlds.</plot>

First, head to an open space - in Brannoch, Melrode and the path along Melrode Monastery work nicely - and start rotating the control stick so that Brian will continuously run in circles. While you're rotating unplug the N64 controller you're using. If done correctly, Brian should still be running in circles. The more you run, the more Agility you gain. With this method you can leave the console on and gain a nice amount of agility without any work. </plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Nope, this is not F-Zero![CR]The game is a futuristic racing game, as it shares some similarities with other futuristic racing games like F-Zero X. In the game the player is able to race with futuristic motorbikes powered by plasma, making it therefore possible to achieve speeds to over 750 km/h, which made this in fact one of the fastest racing games on the N64.[CR]Speed and creative racetrack designs are emphasized, since many of the tracks in the game are built like roller coasters. Perhaps the most notable aspect of this game is it's incredibly catchy Trance soundtrack, which is impressive considering the hardware limitations of the N64.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In an distant future where the entire world is a complete wasteland, human colonists who have found a new planet to call home use their remote controlled power bikes to race through the wastelands of Earth. The winner is the first to cross the finish line, or the last to survive.[CR]Game modes[CR]Single PlayerExtreme ContestPractice ModeTime TrialShoot' Em UpMultiplayerCupHead to HeadFlag GameBattle Arena[CR]Vehicles[CR]The motorbikes each have their own strengths and weaknesses. They have these 5 characteristics.AccelerationSpeedTurnsShieldWeapon[CR]Another difference between the bikes is the type of primary weapon being used.[CR]The player can choose between three types of weapons: Pulse, Excel and Laser.[CR]Tracks and Environments[CR]Tracks in Extreme-G are divided up into 4 general environment types: Desert, City, Mines, and Space.[CR]There are 12 standard tracks in the game, as well as some hidden tracks that can be unlocked by beating the single-player cups on various difficulties.[CR]The single-player cups are divided up as such:[CR]Atomic - Four tracks[CR]Critical Mass - Eight tracks[CR]Meltdown - All twelve tracks combined[CR]Any of these cups can be played on any of the 3 difficulties (Novice, Intermediate, and Extreme).[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The 1997 Formula One World Championship, won by Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in dramatic fashion after a final-race collision with Germany's Michael Schumacher, is recreated in this racing simulation. You have the chance to set up the car to perfect the handling for each of the 17 diverse circuits. Wet racing is incorporated, with gradual weather chances, as well as tyre wear requiring pitstops.[CR]In total there are five distinct gameplay modes. A solo player can play through the entire championship, with practice and qualifying as well as the race against 21 other cars. A Challenge mode including key situations allows you to try to alter the course of history. There is also a 2-player head-to-head mode, Time Attack and one-off races of any length.</plot>

		<title_clean>F-Zero X</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]F-Zero X is the franchise's first showing on the Nintendo 64. F-Zero X was released in 1998. It was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo. Everything is better in this iteration with more playable characters, more courses, and more modes. A second game in the same engine was out on the Nintendo 64 Disk System (Nintendo 64DD) in Japan with a track editor. The original F-Zero X was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Grand PrixGetting close to the finish line![CR]The main mode of F-Zero X in which there are five cups selectable (two of them have to be unlocked like the X Cup, a cup filled of randomly generated courses). Four difficulties are also selectable (Master as to be unlocked). With more cars on the track (30 to be exact), the racing is fast and chaotic as opposing racers will bump the player's car as well as a rival driver the player has to beat. Whoever has the highest number of points wins the cup after five courses. Like the original F-Zero, the car has a health meter and will lose one life if it brakes down (health is at zero) or fall off the stage. Also from the original, boosting is in as soon as the second lap begins as using it takes off a portion of the car's health.Time Attack[CR]This mode is the player's car and only their car going through a certain course as fast as possible.Death Race[CR]The goal of this mode is to take out all the competition as fast as possible.Versus[CR]Up to four players locally can compete on any of the courses.[CR]Characters, Vehicles and Vehicle Grades[CR]Each vehicle is given a letter grade ranging from A (top) to E (lowest) on body, boost and grip.[CR]Body: The body rating represents the machine's strength in regards to the damage it can withstand from collisions against the wall and competing racers.[CR]Boost: The boost rating represents the machine's boost usage in terms of speed increase and duration.[CR]Grip: The grip rating represents the machine's grip in terms of maintaining control while turning a corner.Driver NameVehicle NameBody GradeBoost GradeGrip GradeCaptain FalconBlue FalconBCBDr. StewartGolden FoxDADPicoWild GooseBBCSamurai GorohFire StingrayADBJody SummerWhite CatCCAMighty GazelleWild GazelleEACBabaIron TigerBDAOctomanDeep ClawBBCDr. ClashCrazy BearABEMr. EADGreat StarEADBio RexBig FangBDABillyMad WolfBBCSilver NeelsenNight ThunderBAEGomar &amp; ShiohTwin NoritaEACJohn TanakaWonder WaspDADMrs. ArrowQueen MeteorEBBBlood FalconBlood HawkBAEJack LevinAstro RobinBDAJames McCloudLittle WyvernEBBZodaDeath AnchorEACMichael ChainWild BoarACCSuper ArrowKing MeteorEBBKate AllenSuper PiranhaBCBRoger BusterMighty HurricaneEBBLeonSpace AnglerCCADraqMighty TyphoonCADBeastmanHyper SpeederABDBlack ShadowBlack BullAEAThe SkullSonic PhantomCAD[CR]Cups &amp; Stages[CR]Race OrderJack CupQueen CupKing CupJoker CupDD Cup 1DD Cup 2Track 1Mute City 1Sector AlphaFire FieldRainbow RoadSilence 3Mute City 4Track 2SilenceRed CanyonSilence 2Devil's Forest 3Sand Ocean 3Space Plant 2Track 3Sand OceanDevil's Forest 2Sector BetaSpace PlantDevil's Forest 4Port Town 4Track 4Devil's ForestMute City 2Red Canyon 2Sand Ocean 2Port Town 3Fire Field 2Track 5Big BlueBig Blue 2White Land 2Port Town 2Devil's Forest 4White Land 3Track 6Port TownWhite LandMute City 3Big HandBig Blue 3Big FootX-Cup[CR]The X-Cup is a special cup where the game self-generates six race courses to race on.

		<title_clean>Flying Dragon</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flying Dragon is a Nintendo 64 fighter with several unique traits common to the game series that shares its name, but not found in many other games. To start, it is actually two fighting games in one; a realistic rather formulaic arcade-style fighter as well as a more cartoonish (or chibi-style) looking more outlandish fighter with several then-uncommon RPG elements such as leveling up and accessory equipping. The commonality between the two was that the "cast" is the same with similar though not identical move sets.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Two games in one.[CR]For the most part, Flying Dragon plays like any post Street Fighter era fighter. There are basic combos that tend not to exceed 4 to 5 hits. The moves between characters differ between the games only if they're too outlandish to be featured in the more realistic styled fighter.[CR]The chibi-styled fighter is by far the more substantial of the two experiences. It features a story mode with each character getting its own ending and several characters locked early on that need to be unlocked. Each match warrants a cash reward at the end which can be used to purchase or unlock various things in the game. In addition, there are unique items you unlock or purchase throughout this mode that you can equip to enhance your character in various ways such as a boost in speed, an additional move, superdefense, etc. Some can be used in-game such as health refillers or magic gauge fillers but have conditions such as only being usable once a match or requiring a full magic gauge.[CR]Series[CR]While not marketed as such, especially in North America, Flying Dragon is the 4th or 5th entry in the Flying Dragon series, and is in a lot of ways just a remake of the previous games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Difficulty Modes[CR]At the Option Menu, press Left 20 times for Very Easy, and Right 20 times for Very Hard.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Items for Suzaku and unlock Bokuchin, Ryumuao, and ten medals[CR]Type in  QSF??[circle]B[spade]C~GJHCGL?[heart]?BKBV  at Suzaku's password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Duplicate Items[CR]First you must have two controller paks to do this trick and a game note on each.[CR]Start the game normally and go to the Treasure Box menu.  Trade to the other pak the item you want to duplicate if it's not there already.  Go to the Treasure Exchange option (if not there already).  Take the controller pak that has the desired items out of the controller.  Continue to trade.  If a ''please insert the controller pak back into the controller'' message pops up (either during the trading or after exiting the Treasure Box menu), PRESS B!  It will then ask whether you want to use a controller pak or not.  say no.  Save it just in case by going into the Tournament mode, then cancel out by pressing B.  Reset the game.  Put the controller pak back in.  Voila!  You should have a copy of the traded item in both game notes!  It's very handy for the legendary items and the Ring of Genie....[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Character Unlockables[CR]Complete the following tasks to get the hidden characters</plot>

		<plot>UNRELEASED[CR]Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge is a video game released in 2000. The game is part of the Frogger series, and the sequel to the 1997 remake of Frogger, featuring similar 4-way movement gameplay in a 3D world and 6 different environments. Unlike its predecessor, Frogger 2 featured a choice of different characters to play with in the game, several multiplayer modes, and an in-game storyline. A Nintendo 64 port of the game was planned, but it was cancelled.[CR]The sequel to the Original classic (and the so-so 1997 release) changes the way you look at frogs! The stage is set for a totally new adventure where Frogger and his female friend Lillie Frog will need to leap over, dive under, hop through and climb above endless new obstacles and challenges to save the Frog Babies from Frogger's new arch enemy, the dastardly Swampy the Crocodile.</plot>

		<title_clean>Gauntlet Legends</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A mage named Garm summoned the demon Skorne long ago using the power of thirteen runestones. Skorne wasn't so into the idea of having a master, so he turned on Garm and banished him to the depths of the Underworld. Following that, he scattered the runestones used to summon him across the four realms of the world in an attempt to prevent anyone from gathering them again. Players are thrust into the role of recovering four keys and the thirteen runestones from the different worlds in order to defeat Skorne. The four original characters from the original Gauntlet--Warrior, Valkyrie, Archer, and Wizard--return in Legends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The combat of Legends revolves around the use of basic melee attacks, basic ranged attacks, magic, and potent power attacks. Each character has their own cosmetic variance of attacks but combat is basically mechanically similar. Melee and ranged attacks are used at their respective distances. Magic can be used in one of three ways: an explosion of magic going outward from the character, a damaging shield that surrounds the character, or a thrown potion that explodes when it hits the ground. Power attacks can come in three different varieties. The kind of power attack is determined by a meter above the character's section at the bottom of the screen. The meter slowly fills up as the player causes more damage. The first (or green) level attack produces a more powerful version of the character's normal melee attack. The second (or yellow) level attack produces a 360-degree attack. The third and final (or red) level attack produces an indestructible projectile attack that annihilates any enemies in its path.ItemsBesides the power attacks, the other main variation of the gameplay in Legends in through the use of items. Usually, items are found within treasure chests and barrels scattered throughout the different levels, with the occasional item being found out in the open. On top of that, many of the items are available from the store in the hub between levels. Most of the items in the game fall into general categories with a some outliers being one of a kind.Amulets - Amulets add extra power to the character's standard attack, both melee and ranged. There are four different kinds of amulets (light, fire, electric, and acid) but the difference in merely cosmetic. No one type of amulet is more effective than the other. Only one kind of amulet can be equipped at a time, as well. Amulets last a maximum of 90 seconds.Breaths - Breaths attack enemies in cone in front of the player, with enough strength to take out weaker enemies in one hit. Similar to amulets, breaths come in variations of fire, electric, and acid (no light). Breaths can be stocked up to a maximum of 15 charges.Potions - Potions have multiple uses in Legends. They're most often used to kill Death, who can pop up from random chests or barrels throughout levels to drain health from the player. Potions are the only way to kill Death. They can also be used to attack enemies in a circle near the player, with the radius of that circle increasing as the player's magic skill increases. Potions can be dropped at one's feet, thrown a short distance, or converted into a short-term shield.Shields - Unlike potion shields, item shields are serious business. Coming in either fire or electric, shields from a wall in front (fire) or around (electric) the player that protects from harm and damages any enemies that come into contact with it.Shot Multipliers - 3 or 5 way shot multipliers add additional projectiles to a character's ranged attack, either 3 or 5 shots...obviously.The other significant items that players will come across are keys and gold. Keys unlock things. Gold buys stuff. Fun for all![CR]Characters &amp; Character Progression[CR]The fantasy characters from the original Gauntlet return for Legends each has greater starting ability in a single attribute than the other characters. Warrior - Strength  Wizard - Magic  Archer - Speed  Valkyrie - Armor [CR]Characters in Legends can level up from 1 to 99 throughout the game, increasing five different categories: speed, strength, armor, magic, and health. Speed determines both attack speed and movement speed. Strength increases ranged and melee attack power. Armor decreases the amount of damage taken from attacks. Magic increases a character's ability with magic, making all magic attacks more effective. And health increases simply that, health.[CR]While each of the attributes naturally increases through leveling up, stat increases can also be bought from the store.[CR]</plot>

Glover is thrown out of the castle by the explosion and the other glove has become corrupted and very evil. Cross-Stitch plans to turn the land into a desolate wasteland, but Glover turns the crystals into balls and must use them to save the land from utter destruction.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In this game, players control Glover and his ball.

		<title_clean>Goemon's Great Adventure</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Goemon and friends once again go on adventure. This time to stop Bismaru, who's stolen Wise Man's Ressurection machine.[CR]The 2nd N64 game in the Goemon franchise, Goes to a sidescrolling format. Players can choose between the characters Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, or Yae. There's also a two player co-operative mode, so grab a friend.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Goemon's Great Adventure is a game that has some relation to Mystical Ninja, however a few key differences are made in the game this time around. Instead of making the game a 3D based world to explore, Goemon's Great Adventure is a 2D side scrolling adventure this time around and even a 2nd Player can join in and play the game. Another thing they took out is now the game has a smaller health bar then the previous game, now only taking three hits instead of collecting fortune dolls to increase your health. You can also buy armor to give you 3 more health points and can store food so when your character loses all of it's health, you have another chance to complete the game. The fortune dolls this time around serves as weapon upgrades, eaching containing three sets of weapons to get. However, taking a hit will revert your weapon back to normal, leaving you at a disadvantage when facing enemies tougher then you.[CR]Another key thing they added in this game is they added more Impact fights. These fights are very much like the first one but this time, you have more bosses to fight and get more tougher as you progress in the story, adding more health to the robot boss as well as adding more moves in order to to throw the player off.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is centered on Goemon and his friends trying to story his best friend's sister from using a powerful machine to control the dead. The game is set up that you start at a certain point and then have to beat the level in order to collect Gate Passes. Once you collect enough passes, you can advance to that area's castle and face the boss of that area and move on to the next.[CR]You start off at Edo and encounter that not only must you pass all the levels, but going into a town of that area will allow you to replay a certain level but with tasks to do in order to collect more passes. Once you have enough passes, you enter Edo Castle and encounter that Impact, Goemon's robot from the first game, has gone insane and started attacking the castle. After climbing the burning Edo Castle, you encounter a strange device that is controlling Impact. Once the battle is over, Impact is back to normal and just in time to start an Impact Boss Fight. This happens over the period of the game, you having to collect passes in order to get to the next area in the game, facing a boss and then facing another boss in a robot.[CR]Unlike in the other game, this game gets more and more harder with each stage and taking a hit is always bound to happen. The levels are separated into 5 different areas for our heroes to explore: Edo, Ryugu, Mafu Island, Underworld and finally, Floating Castle, in which there, you will encounter another castle, Dream Castle. Dream Castle is a stage where you must go through the 5 previous castles in order to get to the end, facing the final boss. Some might say that Dream Castle is the hardest of the castles in the game because it adds everything you loved in the first few castles and you must do it all in a few tries. If you lose all your lives, you must start all over again and after enough continues, it's game over.[CR]Every Impact fight is the same with a few differences. This time around, you control not only Impact, but Mrs. Impact as well, another robot created by Wise Man. By throwing a baton, you can switch back and fourth between the robots but you share the same Oil (health). The bosses you face will also throw at you special moves that can only be stopped when you switch off between robots or fill in your special meter by taking damage or dealing damage. The robot health is located on the very top of the screen and goes down with every hit you deal with. But as you progress in the game, the robots tend to have more health then your robot, adding a great deal of challenge in the fight seeing as you are always have the same amount of health.[CR]Even the castles prove to be the hardest part of the game, adding more enemies and traps in the castle. Pitfalls are added more and more often to throw the players off and losing all of your health and armor in the process. You can gain extra lives but once you lose your lives, it's pretty much over. There are some rare occasions that if you lose a robot fight, you have to start that castle's level all over again.[CR]After you beat a certain boss, you will be able to progress in the story and find out what is really going on as more and more ghosts start to appear everywhere. With every area you beat, it means more and more closer to figuring out what is going on.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternative Costumes[CR]Complete the final castle and obtain all forty-four Entry Passes. You will now be able to buy alternative costumes for each of the four characters at specific stores. These include a turban'd ''Arabian Nights'' costume, and a maid outfit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 4-players[CR]After collecting all 44 entry passes, you can have a 4-player game. To do this, have a 2-player game then add controllers to sockets 3 and/or 4. When in the game, press Right-C and Start on controller 3 and/or 4 and an extra player will appear!</plot>

		<title_clean>Harvest Moon 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Harvest Moon 64 is the third game of the series, following Harvest Moon on the SNES and Harvest Moon GB. Many of the features from previous games return in this one, as well as the return of the dating simulation elements that had been absent from Harvest Moon GB. However, the ability to play as a girl was absent from this game, and would not reappear until a remake of Back to Nature, and would not come to games released outside Japan until More Friends of Mineral Town.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game begins with the death of your grandfather. He was a well beloved figure among the locals, and owned a farm that has since become overgrown with rocks and weeds. On his death bed, he asked you to get the ranch back on its feet. Your father isn&#8217;t sure you can handle the responsibility, and will return in three years to check up on you. It&#8217;s up to you to fulfill your late grandfather&#8217;s last request and prove yourself, or your father will drag you back home.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In order to fulfill your grandfather's last request, you have a lot of work to do. Among other things, you aim to clear the land, plant and harvest crops, raise some animals, expand the farm's facilities, and while you're at it, befriend the residents of Flower Bud Village and marry one of the local ladies. You will want to accomplish as much as you can before the third summer, when your father returns to check your progress. This gives you little over two years.[CR]While this sounds like a lot of time at first, a day goes by quickly and a season only lasts thirty days. Certain activities can only be performed in certain seasons; crops and grass can only be grown from Spring to Fall, while you can only mine minerals in the cave during Winter.Tools[CR]To bring the farm back to viability, you&#8217;re going to have to get your hands dirty. Luckily, you start the game with the right tools for the job. These tools will automatically upgrade to silver and gold iterations the more they are used.Axe: Used to destroy tree stumps, each of which requires six strikes to remove. Removing tree stumps is how the player acquires Lumber. Upgrades every 450 uses, each upgrade reduces the number of strikes to destroy a stump. A silver ax can remove a stump with two hits, a golden ax with only one.Watering Can: The tool of choice to water your crops, and those crops need water in order to produce sellable product. Upgraded watering cans increase the can&#8217;s capacity from 30 to 50 (silver) to 80 (gold), and increase the area that can be watered in one use from one square to the three in front of you (silver) to three rows of three in front of you (gold). Upgrades every 600 uses.Hoe: Ignore the name, this hoe (heh) tills the soil, producing tilled squares where seeds can be planted. This tool is also used in the mine. The hoe upgrades every 300 uses, and each upgrade increases the number of squares that can be tilled in one use from one square to three (silver) to five (gold).Hammer: Stop, it&#8217;s hammer time. This tool is the only thing that can destroy the stones on your farm, though said stones can be repurposed into unbreakable fences. The hammer can also flatten tilled soil. Upgrades every 100 uses, and each upgrade reduces the number of strikes required to break large stones from six to two (silver) to one (gold). A golden hammer is required to break the large rock in the middle of the pond.Sickle: The choice for all the working class! This thing clears weeds and planted grass; clearing the latter converts it into animal fodder for your sheep and cows and sends it to your silo automatically. Every 350 use upgrades it, improving the number of squares that can be cleared to the one directly in front of you to three in front of you (silver) to every square surrounding you (gold.) Be advised that using the sickle on any animal is a very, very bad idea.Crops[CR]One of the main sources of income for the game, especially early on, is farming. Seeds can be bought from the Flower Shop, and can be planted outside in any season except for Winter. A greenhouse eliminates any season limitation on growing crops inside the house. Said seeds can only be planted in tilled soil, and a plot of seeded soil must be watered in order for the crops to grow.[CR]Spring: All crops can only be harvested once.Turnip, 4 day growth cycle, costs 200G/60G per cropPotato, 6 day growth cycle, costs 200G/80G per cropCabbage, 8 day growth cycle, costs 200G/90G per crop[CR]Summer: All crops can be harvested multiple times.Tomato, 9 days, costs 300G/90G per cropCorn, 13 days, costs 300G/120G per crop[CR]Fall: Eggplants can be harvested multiple times.Eggplant, 7 days, costs 300G/60G per crop[CR]Winter: Strawberries can only be harvested once.Strawberry, 6 days, costs 500G/150G per crop[CR]Flowers and fields of grass can also be grown on the farm, with varying effects. Growing flowers tend to make the women of the town like you more.Moon Drop Grass: The default flower. Grown during the Spring and Summer. Grows in 6 days. Costs 300G.Pink Cat Mint: Special flower that can only be bought during the Flower Festival. Grown during the Spring and Summer. Grows in 8 days. Costs 300G.Blue Mist Flower: Special flower that can only be bought during Year 2, and even then from Spring 25th through Spring 30th. Grows in 8 days through the start of Summer, must be flowered every day or it will die. Successfully growing this flower will add a picture to your album. Costs 500G.Grass: Plants that can double as naturally grown fodder for your sheep and cows. Can only be bought in Spring and Summer, but can be grown through the Fall. Grows in 9 days. Costs 500G.Livestock[CR]Once you&#8217;ve got a stable amount of cash rolling in, it&#8217;s time to buy some animals! There are five animals to take care of, and you start the game with one of them. As a general rule, it is a good idea to brush and talk to your animals.Dog: You start the game with your trusty dog, who will never get sick or die, and does not need to be brushed. You can feed him by putting something edible into his doggie dish. Taking good care of your dog is essential to doing well in the Dog Festival in Winter.Horse: You get a young horse upon visiting the Green Ranch for the first time, but you cannot ride the horse until he has grown up. Brushing the horse makes him like you more and makes him do better in the horse races.Chickens: Chickens can be bought at the Green Ranch for 1,500G. They will lay eggs daily that are worth 50G, and said eggs can be hatched in the incubator. Chickens must either be feed chicken feed daily (costs 10G per meal), or can be left outside in an enclosed area if the weather is good. Chickens can get sick, but only require food to get well.Cows: The true moneymakers of your animals. They cost a pretty penny at 6000G and will not start out producing milk for 21 days (and a milker costs 1800G at Rick&#8217;s). Once it does however, milk will be one of your best ways to earn money daily- small milk sells at 100G, medium milk at 150G, large at 300G, and gold milk (only available to Cow Festival winners) at 500G. Cows can be impregnated with Miracle Potion (3000G). Sick cows and sheep must be given medicine (1000G) for their conditions to improve. Cows must either be fed cow feed (30G per meal or just cut some grass you planted), or left in a grassy field. Cows and sheep can both be directed to come towards you by using the Bell (given for free upon the purchase of your first cow or sheep).Sheep: Sheep can be bought for 4000G, and like cows do not arrive at the farm fully grown. Wool can be cut off the sheep every week for 900G (or 1800G if the wool is high quality) with shears from Rick&#8217;s (1000G). Sheep are fed and taken care of in the same manner as cows.House[CR]Your house can be improved greatly from the small little shack you start out with. Additions generally require a large amount of gold and lumber, the latter of which can be acquired by using your ax on stumps scattered around the farm and Moon Mountain. While not every extension has a use, having all of them reflects well upon your father&#8217;s evaluation.[CR]Extension Name[CR]Cost[CR]Notes[CR]Kitchen[CR]5000G, 450 Lumber[CR]Required for marriage, allows storage of food, keeps track of Power Berries and recipes.[CR]Bathroom[CR]3000G, 300 Lumber[CR]Using the bath prevents sickness.[CR]Baby Bed[CR]1000G, 200 Lumber[CR]Required to have a baby.[CR]Log Terrace[CR]7000G, 350 Lumber[CR]Purely decorative, only useful for dad&#8217;s evaluation.[CR]Staircase[CR]2000G, 250 Lumber[CR]Purely decorative, only useful for dad&#8217;s evaluation.[CR]Greenhouse[CR]30000G, 580 Lumber[CR]Allows farming during winter. Be advised, this improvement can be destroyed by hurricanes.Women[CR]In order to get a good evaluation, you will need to get married and have a kid. Lucky for you, there&#8217;s five available women to choose from. Once you&#8217;re married, your wife will help out around the farm.[CR]If you find yourself not liking any of the eligible women, or you don&#8217;t like the idea of having a kid, don&#8217;t worry. Unlike some future games in the franchise, you can remain a bachelor and be able to continue playing. Just don&#8217;t be surprised when other townspeople make their own moves.Ann: The redhead from Green Ranch. She is the daughter of the ranch&#8217;s owner and Gray&#8217;s sister, and is good friends with Karen. Loves your dog, wool, eggs, milk and people who win the horse race. Her Birthday is Summer 14.Karen: The daughter of the vineyard owner. Loves Veryberries and wild grapes (only found in the spring and fall), tomatoes, and strawberries; will be impressed if you can outdrink her at New Year&#8217;s. If not befriended, she will run away from home. Her Birthday is Winter 29.Popuri: The pink-haired daughter of the Flower Shop owners, and probably the easiest to woo. Loves flowers and baked goods. Taking care of the Blue Mist plant makes her like you more. Planting flowers at your farm is generally a good idea. Her Birthday is Spring 22.Elli: The brunette that works at the bakery. Loves baked goods, eggs, milk, and fish. She takes care of her grandmother, who sits on her rocking chair outside the bakery. Her Birthday is Fall 1.Maria: The mayor&#8217;s daughter, and a shy bookworm who appropriately works as a librarian. Likes it when you read books at the library, cabbages, and bugs. Her Birthday is Winter 11.Rivals[CR]You aren't the only one with eyes for the ladies of Flower Bud Village. Although they won't act unless you have befriended them, there are five bachelors who are considered romantic rivals for the five bachelorettes.Cliff: A quiet vagrant who is passing through on his travels, accompanied by his pet hawk Cain. If you become friends with him, he will stay and inevitably develop an interest in Ann.Kai: The kind and diligent hired hand of the local vineyard, working to support his poor family abroad. It's no small secret that he likes the owner's daughter, Karen, and does what he can to stop the feud between her and her father.Gray: Ann's older brother, who sports an impossibly cold demeanor. He seems to enjoy taking care of animals and, despite his veil of indifference, clearly has a soft spot for his childhood friend Popuri.Jeff: The 30-year-old owner of the bakery. A dainty fellow with a passion for what he does, he also likes fishing and young girls, apparently. He will marry Elli if you don't call dibs.Harris: Your friendly neighborhood mailman and bringer of cheer, who happens to have a crush on Maria. He's long been trying to muster the courage to confess his feelings.Recipes[CR]These have no real impact on the game, but count towards your father&#8217;s evaluation. Giving certain items to the townspeople will give you recipes. Some townspeople will not give their recipes to you unless you&#8217;re good friends with them. It is advisable to reset in case they don&#8217;t hand over the recipes to avoid losing money.Edible Herbs: Old woman of Moon Mountain, Potion Shop ownerTurnips: Old man of Moon Mountain, Maria&#8217;s momPotato: Ann, May, the mayor, Harris the mailmanFish: Fisherman (Blue fish), one of the working carpentersCorn: Ann&#8217;s dad, Popuri&#8217;s dadTomatoes: Karen, Karen&#8217;s mom, the priest, Popuri&#8217;s mom, the shipperWild Grapes: Karen&#8217;s dad, Kai (Veryberries work), bartenderStrawberries: Karen, Popuri, StuEggs: Cliff, Gray, Kent, ElliMilk: Rick, Bakery OwnerMushroom: Lead carpenter, one of the working carpenters, Harvest Sprite outside caveFestivals[CR]Returning from the original Harvest Moon, festivals are events that are celebrated or observed by the town. Several real-life holidays are observed by Flower Bud Village, while other fictional holidays are also celebrated. Most festivals are held in the town square, though others are also held at the beach and Green Ranch.[CR]Of particular note are the Fireworks (Summer 1), Thanksgiving (Winter 10), and the Starry Night (Winter 24); The Starry Night and the Fireworks festivals are held in multiple locations and have different potential wives located at them. The latter festival takes place throughout the town, and people may come to the farm to bring you cakes.[CR]Festival Name[CR]Date[CR]Location[CR]Notes[CR]New Year's Festival[CR]Spring 1st[CR]Town Square[CR]The more you&#8217;ve drank over the year, the longer you&#8217;ll last.[CR]Planting Festival[CR]Spring 8th[CR]Town Square[CR]Horse Race[CR]Spring 17th[CR]Town SquareFlower FestivalSpring 23rdTown SquareMay vote for Flower Princess before day of festival[CR]Fireworks[CR]Summer 1st[CR]Location varies[CR]Ann is at the Green Ranch, Elli at the Bakery, Karen at the beach, Maria at the Town Square, Popuri at Moon Mountain&#8217;s summit.[CR]Vegetable Festival[CR]Summer 9th[CR]Town Square[CR]Summer crops do not grow quickly enough for you to enter the festival.[CR]Firefly Festival[CR]Summer 17th[CR]Beach[CR]Sea Festival[CR]Summer 24th[CR]Beach[CR]Button mashing is your path to victory.[CR]Cow Festival[CR]Fall 4th[CR]Green Ranch[CR]The winning cow will start making Gold Milk.[CR]Harvest Festival[CR]Fall 12th[CR]Town Square[CR]The Harvest King is selected randomly.

It was praised for its compelling gameplay, but criticized for low-quality and repetitive music. Its role-playing elements have led some to call it one of the few RPGs on the system.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dog Glitch[CR]This glitch is rather easy to use and it benefits both your relationship with Karen and your dog's affection level. [CR]To perform this glitch, simply take your dog to Karen and talk to her many times when you are holding it. It is best to do this when she is inside a building because it takes a while. As you are talking to Karen, you will see her heart level rise. [CR]There are two side effects to this glitch. First, Karen will be at a red heart (or where ever you stop). To marry her, all you need is the kitchen and a blue feather. Also, your dog will like you more. If you feed him and pick him up and run him every day, he might be able to win the first Winter Dog Race.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] up-graded tools[CR]All of these can just be used you don't have to hit anything. For the Golden items you don't have to charge them up(It doesn't make it faster.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get large milk easy:[CR]Just let your cow get sick by not feeding it or leaving it out in the rain and give it the animal medicine. You will probably have to do this three or four times to get large milk. After two times you should have medium milk. And after three times you should have large milk.</plot>

		<title_clean>Hercules - The Legendary Journeys</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hercules: The Legendary Journeys is a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color game from Titus (based on the hit television show). It centers around one of the most popular Grecian myths, that of Heracles, or, as he is better known, Hercules. The game involves a combination of skirmishes with random enemies and bosses, elementary puzzles, and numerous trading sequences and side quests similar to the ones found in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The player can also play as two of Herc's friends, Lolaus and Serena (or the Golden Hind, as the half woman, half horse character is referred to in the game): they each have their own unique attacks and weapons. Legendary Journeys is known to have many bugs and technical issues (alongside its clunky controls) that make the game frustrating and unnecessarily difficult in numerous places. This game proved to be another high profile failure for the once beloved Titus as it continued to plunge deeper into the territory of poorly developed action/adventure games; directly following the release of the critically-despised Superman 64.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Though Hercules is the primary player character, the player does take control of Lolaus and the Golden Hind during certain moments of the game. Each of these characters have a unique control scheme; unfortunately, perhaps due to a lack of care in the game's development, the other two characters are both exceedingly difficult to control and considerably weaker than Hercules. Nonetheless, the character's attributes are listed below:[CR] Hercules - The strongest and most primarily used of the characters, Hercules' primary attack is the punch by way of pressing the B button. Upon holding the B button, Hercules can also use a "super punch" that does greater damage and can be used to break through weakened walls. Furthermore, although all characters will stun enemies after a certain number of hits (bosses excluded), Hercules is the only character capable of picking up and throwing enemies; instantly killing both the enemy and any other enemies with which the thrown one makes contact. Furthermore, Herc is the only character that can purchase potions from the tavern owner (who exists in all of the game's towns) that unleash lavish special attacks centered around four elements: earth, fire, lightning, and ice. The earth potion drops rocks from the sky upon his unexpecting enemies; the fire potion unleashes burning balls of molten lava upon Herc's adversaries; the lightning potion performs a similar attack by way of giant, thundering lightning bolts; and the ice potion temporarily freezes one's foe(s). These potions are accessed via the C buttons. Although Hercules is the most overpowered of the game's characters, his portions can be nonetheless difficult to play due to a weak camera and the lack of a lock-on system.Iolaus - The sidekick of Hercules, Iolaus is useful as the only character in the game capable of climbing vines (which have an odd graphical similarity to those in Ocarina of Time). However, once he has climbed said vines and reached whatever dangers await him at the top, he is faced with the difficulty of fighting with his exceedingly underpowered staff (perhaps he is Herc's sidekick for a reason, eh?). Iolaus is also useful in one instance in which the snowy alps can only be crossed by a body small enough to fit into the only available winter coat. Iolaus cannot leave any of his designated playable areas however, if the player tries, they are met with the message: "Perhaps I should let Herc take care of this."The Golden Hind - Though christened Serena in the television series, the game (for some unbeknownst reason) refers to her as The Golden Hind. This lady Centaur is, in fact, the weakest of the three characters. The Hind's only method of attack is the shooting of her arrows, done in a first person mode. Although the arrows can be shot in the standard third-person perspective, they are guaranteed to strike nothing unless the enemy lies directly in front of the Hind. The first-person mode is troubling however, as the controls are so unbearably clunky and difficult to use that the player will have almost certainly lost a considerable amount of health by the time he/she was even capable of training his/her sights upon his/her adversaries. Fortunately, The Golden Hind also has the smallest amount of game time between the three characters; and, like Lolaus, is restrained to her respective areas with a message identical to his.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hexen (sometimes known as HeXen: Beyond Heretic) is a fantasy first-person shooter developed by Raven and published by id on October 30, 1995 for the PC. It is the second game in the Serpent Riders trilogy (between Heretic and Hexen II). The story takes place in the realm of Cronos, which was overtaken by the Serpent Rider Korax. The player controls one of three heroes ( Baratus the Fighter, Parias the Cleric, or Daedolon the Mage) as they set out to destroy Korax.[CR]The game builds upon the same engine used in Heretic (which uses a heavily-modified id Tech 1, the same engine used in Doom). In addition to the modifications found in Heretic, Hexen also includes jumping, multiple classes, rotating/moveable walls, weather effects, a level scripting system, CD audio, FMV cutscenes (for the CD version only), eight player multiplayer, and a system of interconnected levels (called "hubs"). The source code for this engine was released twice: one in 1999 under a restrictive license and one in 2008 under the GNU General Public License.[CR]The game was published for the Mac in 1996 by GT Interactive (who also oversaw distribution of the PC version). In early 1997, the game was ported to the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn (all which were published by GT Interactive). The Nintendo 64 version, ported by Software Creations, includes split-screen multi-player ( for up to four players) and text narratives in the loading screens of each level (describing each level). The PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions were ported by Probe, and includes graphical restrictions (less detailed architecture, less monster sprites, etc.) and lower frame rate. The PlayStation version does not support multi-player, while the Sega Saturn version includes two-player link-up multiplayer only accessible via a hidden cheat code.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Hexen was one of the first first-person shooters to let the player choose between one of three unique classes, each with their own unique attributes, weapons, and item effects.Fighter[CR]Tougher and more agile than the other classes, the fighter specializes in melee combat. His only weakness is his lack of ranged attacks.Spiked Gauntlets - The fighter's starting weapon. Deals three powerful punches in quick succession at very close range.Timon's Axe - Its power and effectiveness is determined by how much blue mana you have. Although you do not need blue mana to swing the weapon, blue mana is required for a powerful electric swing.Hammer of Retribution - On close range, it's slow and does great damage. But if you have green mana, the hammer can fire an exploding projectile, making it an ideal long-range weapon for the class.Quietus - A big sword surrounded by green flames. Throws five green fireballs across the screen in a single swing. Uses up both green and blue mana and cannot be used like a melee weapon.Cleric[CR]Despite the class name, the cleric does not heal others. A balanced character with a lot of specialized weapons.Mace of Contrition - Although it is less powerful than the fighter's spiked gauntlets, this mace has a longer range.Serpent Staff - Uses blue mana for two purposes. At long range, it fires two green fireballs in a wave that, while weak, deals poisonous damage. At short range, it drains the health of the opponent, healing you in the process.Firestorm - Uses green mana to shoot a streak of fire from your hands across a set distance, causing explosion damage in the process.Wraithverge - Uses both blue and green mana to fire a gray cloud that immediately splits into four powerful ghosts. Shrieking, these fast ghosts lock in to enemies and drain a lot of damage before moving on to the next enemy. (Or disappearing once the attack is over)Mage[CR]Weak and slow, the mage specializes in powerful long-range weapons.Sapphire Wand - Similar to the starting weapon in Heretic, this wand fires weak (but fast) energy blasts. It has infinite ammo, even though it's a long-range weapon.Frost Shards - Uses blue mana to fire a blast of ice shards in a diamond formation from your hand. When the enemy dies from it, it freezes and then shatters.Arc of Death - Uses green mana to fire a powerful bolt of electricity from your hand. The bolt follows a straight path along both the floor and the ceiling, over cliff sides and under arches before reaching an enemy, dealing electrical damage to that enemy.Bloodscourge - Uses both blue and green mana to fire three incredibly powerful fireballs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Hexen splits the levels into five key episodes, also known as "hubs." Each episode requires you to solve a very large puzzle.[CR]Seven Portals - After completing the prologue level (Winnowing Hall), players must venture through the guardians of Fire, Ice, and Steel to open all seven gates.[CR]Shadow Wood - Players must access a temple by finding the right keys in the Darkmere swamp, the rocky Wastelands, and the Caves of Circe. At the end, you must fight the Death Wyvern.[CR]Heresiarch's Seminary - Players must find gems in the Silent Refectory and the Orchard of Lamentations and place them in an astrological chart, then solve the puzzles of the Wolf, Dragon, and Griffin chapels. After solving these puzzles, you fight the first Heresiarch.[CR]Castle of Grief - Players must repair a big clock by finding gears scattered across the castle. After getting the clock to work, you must solve a string of puzzles to reach a key to fight the second Heresiarch.[CR]Necropolis - Players must travel to the tombs of their former masters (brought back from the dead by Korax) and kill them. After that, you must travel to the Dark Crucible to face the final battle with Korax.[CR]Timon's Axe, Serpent Staff and Frozen Shards are first found in the Seven Portals episode. Hammer of Retribution, Firestorm, and Arc of Death are first found in the Shadow Wood episode. Quietus, Wraithverge, and Bloodscourge require three components scattered throughout the game. The first component is found in the Seven Portals, the second component is found in the Shadow Wood episode, the third component is found in the Heresiarch's Seminary episode, and all three components can be found in the secret level of the Castle of Grief episode.[CR]The game also supports multiplayer in both co-operative and deathmatch settings for up to eight players. Some weapons, such as the Wraithverge, have been nerfed to keep deathmatch balanced.[CR]Deathkings of the Dark Citadel[CR]Box art for Deathkings of the Dark Citadel[CR]Hexen received one official expansion pack, named Deathkings of the Dark Citadel. Requiring the original Hexen to play, it added 20 new levels, split into three hubs, with new puzzles. It also featured six new deathmatch levels. The hubs include:BlightConstable's GateNave[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Hot Wheels - Turbo Racing</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing is a racing game for the PS1 and N64 released in 1991. It features a large selection of Hot Wheels branded cars and tracks for players to race on. Each track contains a number of jumps that launch players into the air so they can perform stunts, all of which earns them turbo. In addition to providing a short boost of speed, turbo can allow a player to unlock hidden shortcuts, some of which contain "Mystery Cars" that unlock a new car for them after the race is over. There are other places hidden on tracks accessible by means other than turbo as well.[CR]The Playstation version consisted of a full licensed soundtrack, with an edited-for-content version of Metallica's Fuel in the intro video.

		<title_clean>Hybrid Heaven</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Hybrid Heaven is an Action RPG for the Nintendo 64.  The player assumes the role of Johnny Slater, a bodyguard of the current United States president.  Johnny must infiltrate an enormous underground installation beneath Manhattan to try to stop a hostile race of aliens from replacing key humans within the United States Government with synthetic "hybrids".  Along the way, Johnny must avoid or disable mechanical defense systems and fight strange creatures (referred to as "biological weapons").  As the player progresses through the game, Johnny becomes more proficient at fighting and "levels up" as with other RPGs. Despite a high level of hype due to the lack of RPGs on the N64, the  game was met with lukewarm reviews and low sales in the wake of the  release of Ocarina of Time.  [CR]Exploration [CR]During exploration, Hybrid Heaven plays similar to 3D adventure games, such as Tomb Raider - the player must navigate the installation by jumping, crawling, climbing, and pressing switches.  The player also possesses an electronic defuser, which can damage or disable robots, but has no effect on living creatures such as the biological weapons.  While exploring, the player may discover storage compartments containing items for use in battles.  There are also many enemies strolling around the complex which the player will often stumble into.  If the player is spotted by one of these creatures, it will begin to hustle towards the player to engage in combat.  If the player is able to get behind an enemy without being spotted, the player can gain a significant advantage in the ensuing combat.  Either way, once the player comes into close proximity with an enemy, the game shifts into combat mode with very different gameplay and controls. [CR]Combat [CR]When the player engages an enemy in combat, the gameplay becomes similar to a 3D fighting game with RPG elements.  The player may move around the room in two dimensions and execute hand-to-hand attacks against the enemy, while blocking or avoiding the enemy's retaliation.  However, unlike most fighting games, when one combatant wishes to attack, the action is paused while the combatant chooses which body part to attack with (R/L leg, R/L arm, torso, head) and which attack to execute.  The opponent is then notified of an incoming attack and must choose how to defend (dodge, block, counter).  The type of attack and the attacker's skill level versus the defender's chosen defense and skill level will determine the attack's success.  The frequency of attacks is limited by each combatant's power bar, which slowly fills until it reaches full strength.  If a combatant attacks before it is completely full, his attacks will less powerful, proportional to the bar's state.  Eventually, the player will gain the ability to let his power bar fill to multiple stages, essentially storing power for multiple attacks, which can be unleashed in the form of combos - the player can create strings of attacks which are very difficult to defend against if properly executed.  In this style, the game focuses on strategy and tactics rather than  speed and reflexes.  [CR]Attacks and Defenses[CR]There are essentially three different subgroups of attacks: punches, kicks, and wrestling moves called "techniques". Punches A punch is made up of three components: the arm attacked with, the height of the attack, and the type of punch thrown.  For example, the "right mid hook" is a punch that attacks an enemy's midsection with the right hand in a sweeping motion from the side.  It is likely to strike the opponent's torso or left arm.  On the other hand, a "left upper punch" will throw a straight punch with the left hand, targeted at the opponent's head.  Punches are useful in close quarters and can stun an enemy if it receives enough blows to the head.  Kicks A kick is constructed similar to a punch: it has a side, a height, and a type of kick.  Kicks tend to be more powerful than punches but require precise placement or they will glance off, causing little damage.  In addition, kicks can be used to attack an enemy's legs, tripping him or possibly hampering his movement.  When an opponent is prone, kicks can be used as a ground attack to stomp on an enemy. TechniquesTechniques are wrestling moves that can be executed after the player grapples an enemy.  They can cause massive damage, but are dangerous to perform because the player must get in very close and attempt to grapple an enemy.  Even after being grappled, if the enemy's power bar is higher than the player's, it might be able reverse the attack and land its own technique.  A technique often uses the player's torso for the attack, as the player must lift or throw the enemy to the ground.  For example, the "lift up vertical drop" (more commonly known as a powerbomb) lifts the enemy into the air and slams him down onto his back, injuring the torso and possibly the head.  An exception to this is the headbutt, which uses the player's head to attack the enemy's head.  Against a prone enemy, techniques can be used to perform submission moves, such as a choke or arm bar.  Submission moves cause intense damage to the body part they target, but are difficult to perform because the enemy must stay down long enough for the player to execute the attack.  Defenses When attacked the player will be presented with options to defend, although the type of attack will not be displayed; hence the player must learn the strategy of his opponent to anticipate his attacks.  Against punches and kicks, the player may attempt to dodge, guard, or counter.  Dodging allows the player to move slightly in an attempt to get out of the way.  However, if the attack still lands, the player will take full damage.  Guarding almost always significantly reduces the damage and power of an attack that lands.  Countering causes the player to attempt to duck or sway out of the attack's range and follow up with a punch or kick that will always land.  Counters are difficult to perform but are extremely effective.  When a player is prone, he may only roll or counter.  Rolling functions similarly to dodging: the player attempts to move away from the attack's reach.  Countering allows the player to land his own attack and stand up, but does not always work properly.  Guarding is not possible while prone.  When a player is in a grapple, he may defend by taking the fall, escaping, or attempting a reversal.  Taking the fall functions like guarding: the player allows the enemy to perform the attack and focuses on reducing the damage.  Escaping causes the player to attempt to wrestle free of the enemy's grapple.  Finally, a reversal causes the player to attempt to turn the grapple into his own technique, but this only works against less skilled opponents.Injury When a powerful attack lands, it can cripple  the body part that was hit, causing the opponent to be temporarily hindered further.  An injured leg causes the combatant to move more slowly, while an injured arm makes it more difficult to guard.  An injured torso causes the combatant to recover stamina more slowly.  Finally, if the combatant suffers an injury to his head, he is knocked unconscious and the opponent is free to destroy him for several seconds.  In all cases, an injured body part cannot be used to execute attacks.  Injuries go away after a short amount of time.  [CR]RPG Elements [CR]As the player battles enemies, each body part will level up and become better at attacking and defending, depending on its frequency of use.  In addition, the player gains general statistics such as health, stamina, and reflexes.  Finally, the player has a chance to learn new attacks that were used against him at the end of each fight.  This is the only way to learn moves, so it is beneficial to allow an enemy to show off his moves in order to pick them up.  There are also many items that the player will gather over the course of the game.  These can be used to heal the player, enhance an attribute, or attack an enemy.  Also, defeated enemies drop items based on the rank a player receives at the end of the fight.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlockable Codes[CR]Beat the game on Hard and/or Ultimate, then enter the following codes at the title screen. If entered correctly, the word "Extra" will appear under the title name.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Demo Select (Movie Cut-scene viewer) option[CR]Complete the game (any difficulty) and go to Survival Mode (again, any difficulty). Defeat all 40 enemies in Survival mode - and after you beat it a menu appears letting you view any cutscene in any order. However once you exit this option you have to go through Survival mode all over again to get it back.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]  The arcade cabinet Hydro Thunder is a racing game develop by                        Eurocom and publish by                       Midway. It was released for the arcades,                      Dreamcast,                     Nintendo 64, and                    PlayStation; the game was a launch title for the Dreamcast then later released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. Hydro Thunder is also a part of Midway's "Thunder" franchise that includes: Offroad Thunder,  Arctic Thunder, and  4 Wheel Thunder.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Hydro Thunder follows the same format as many other racers. The player picks a powerboat to race on one of thirteen tracks. The game contains destroyed cities ancient ruins to race on, and all backed up with a orchestral musical score. The levels and boats are broken down into three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard; bonus levels and boats are available once the first nine levels are beaten.  Thunder Park  Boosting fuel will be laid out throughout the track. A meter will indicate how long the player can boost. The boosting will let the player boost for a certain amount of time. There are two version of the boost, the blue boost will add four seconds to the boosting meter; while the red boost will add twelve seconds. Another technique known as the "hydro jump," it can be use if the player has some boosting fuel. The way it works is the player hits the brake then lets go and hit boost; that will allow the player to jump and reach short-cuts and extra boost that are suspending up in the air.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Easy Tracks Thunder Park - "A traditional H.T.R.A circuit track. On a sunny day Thunder Park offers a competition-style hydroplane raceway loop. Try to find the hidden 9 second boost on this track."  Lost Island  Lost Island - "Located somewhere in the South Pacific, the Lost Island track offers a fast-paced trek through a volcanic island. Lush greenery, native villages, ancient ruins and numerous secrets await you!"Arctic Circle - "Gigantic ice formations and a variety of wildlife line this unique track. The race starts near a fishing village high above sea level, continues in a river that winds its way down a glacier, through water-carved ice tunnels until finally dropping you to the ocean for the remainder of the race."Medium TracksGreek Isles - "The Greek Isles water tracks winds through both modern towns and ancient ruins, providing one of the most visually stunning tracks available. This is a bright and challenging track, highlighted by a downhill sliding finish."  Greek Isles  Lake Powell - "Lake Powell, located in Utah, is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. With its gigantic narrow canyon walls, 1000-year-old Anasazi ruins and smooth water. It is the perfect place for a high-speed super-boat race. Unfortunately, the Utah state police don't agree."The Far East - "The Far East track, located on a river deep in the misty mountains of China, offers a unique blend of challenging river racing and beautiful scenery. The river drops from the mountains into small villages, ancient brick canals and even through palace motes."Hard Tracks Ship Graveyard - "This deserted atoll was once a productive military shipyard. Now, endless numbers forgotten, decrepit naval ships line the coast as far the eyes can see, forming a maze-like water raceway in and out of hollow steel hulls. Rough waves, shark-infested waters, stormy weather and the military police all await you!"  New York Disaster  Venice Canals - "Ah, Venice. One thinks of lovers, romance and of course the ear-piercing roar of sixteen super-boat motors tearing through the moonlight canals! With its extremely sharps turns that never let up, Venice Canals is arguably the most difficult track in Hydro Thunder."New York Disaster - "A giant meteor has destroyed the Big-Apple and flooded its once crowed streets. Sounds like a fun race, huh? Tear through the remains of the late city, avoiding the N.Y.P.D and the countless submerged vehicles along the way, until you come crashing down to a tragic finished."Bonus Tracks Nile Adventure - "Race through ancient pyramids and narrow waterways. This track features danger at every sharp turn. The longest track in Hydro Thunder, Nile Adventure is also perhaps the hardest."Hydro Speedway - "Set at night, Hydro Speedway is the second bonus circuit track in the game.With fast-pace excitement and boost icons at every turn; Hydro Thunder will test even the best racer."Catacomb - "Go full throttle through a mysterious cavern filled with crashed, sharp rocks and of course, the competition. Turn and hydro jump your way to victory, if you can."Castle Von Dany - "Journey to Scotland and take a watery romp through an abandon castle. Steer around the moat and ancient graveyard to victory." [CR]Boats [CR]Easy Boats   Damn The Torpedoes - "Damn The Torpedoes is a good introductory boat for racing. Although it is slower than most boats in speed and Mighty Hull activation time, it is the ideal for beginning racer."Midway - "Very stable and not susceptible to being knocked around by other boats, Midway is another good choice for the beginning racer. Midway's weaknesses are its slow booster and Mighty Hull activation times."Miss Behave - "Able to slice the water for better turning. Miss Behave is one of the smallest boats in the H.T.R.A lineup. The boosters are slightly under-powered but Miss Behave's real strength lies in her ability to glide while in the air. With parts salvaged from a World War II aircraft, Miss Behave is the "flyer" of the beginning boats."Medium Boats Banshee - "Once a standard hydroplane, Banshee was altered for H.T.R.A racing. Banshee is lightweight and easily knocked around by other boats, but once you've mastered unique handling of the boat you may never choose another boat again!"Tidal Blade - "Tidal Blade's sleek, dragster like hull design allows it to slice through any water condition. When you have activated your Mighty Hull feature, use Tidal Blade's long bow to knock the competition out of the water. At times, if Tidal Blade gets bumped it can be hard to control and keep stable."Thresher - "Known as the "    caddy" of the H.T.R.A lineup, Thresher is the easiest boat to control. Big and heavy, the boat is well balanced and is easy to steer. Although it has a fairly slow Mighty Hull activation time, Thresher secret weapon is its ability to knock opponents around by using its heavy frame."Advanced Boats Cutthroat - "Lightweight and as close to a military jet fighter as you can get, Cutthroat is one of the best boats in the H.T.R.A lineup. Heavily altered and using "borrowed" military hardware, Cutthroat can soar off of H.T.R.A ramps or other objects for great distances. Use this to your advantage. Even though it has an extremely fast Mighty Hull activation time, it is very light and easily tossed around by other boats." Cutthroat  Rad Hazard - "Created with scrap parts found outside U.S Government Area 51 property, Rad Hazard is recommended for the most experienced racers. Use the boosters to help you take corners better. The fast Mighty Hull activation time helps to keep the competition away. Fast and powerful, Rad Hazard is a boat to reckoned with."Razorback - "The most difficult boat to control in the H.T.R.A lineup! Once thought of as a total design failure, Razorback was forgotten until an H.T.R.A member learned the secret to mastering this fast and furious boat! With speed and Mighty Hull activation time like no other, Razorback is recommended for only the most experienced racers!"Bonus Boats The bonus boat are unlocked once the player beats the first nine levels of the game. The bonus boats include the following: ChumdingerBlowfish TinytanicArmed Response   [CR]Spiritual Successor [CR]A sequel to Hydro Thunder was supposedly in the works at one point, but was later cancelled.  In 2009,     Raw Thrills, which contains developers of the original game, announced a spiritual successor to Hydro Thunder; known as          H2Overdrive. Other than the spiritual successor, an  actual sequel was announced by previously unknown developer    Vector Unit in March 2010, under the name  Hydro Thunder: Hurricane, on        Xbox Live Arcade.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Iggy is Acclaim's iguana mascot in ball form.[CR]Iggy's Reckin' Balls is a game published by the now defunct Acclaim Entertainment and was exclusively for the Nintendo 64. The game's eight starting characters are all anthropomorphic balls that have to use their abilities to climb to the top of each of the game's towers first. While all the characters were the same in terms of their abilities, the game box boasts that all eight characters had different personalities; however, these seemed to have no impact in the gameplay.[CR]As well as the normal mode, which involved racing against three other computer or player controlled opponents. The game had other modes as well, such as time trial and battle mode.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level in the game was called a 'tower', due to the generally vertical nature of the levels. Traversing each tower is mainly undertaken via the use of a grapple hook - often the character's tongue. The grapple ability is primarily used to hook onto platforms - either to progress upwards or to avoid projectiles. The grapple can also be used to hook onto other players in order to stun them momentarily or to throw them off the course.[CR]As well the the grapple, players are able to flap for a short distance to bridge gaps, and initiate 'turbo mode' to roll at great speeds.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Characters[CR] At the player select screen, press Z,A,Left,Right[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Password Cheats[CR]Enter these codes on the password screen.

		<title_clean>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game takes place in Babylon where Indiana Jones meets up with Sophia Hapgood. Meanwhile, the Russians are digging around in old Babylonian ruins. At the request of Sophia, Indy attempts to discover what they are searching for. He finds that they are looking for an "infernal machine" that can be used to converse with the ancient Babylonian god, Marduk. Of course, Indy intends to find it first. Unfortunately though, the machine is broken up into many pieces. Fortunately however, he stumbles upon a tablet that points to the locations of the various pieces. And thus, this is where the game begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay has many notable similarities to the Tomb Raider series. To begin with, Indy is constantly exploring throughout the game. He runs through canyons, fields, and valleys (among other places). During this exploration, he is jumping across chasms, exploring hidden passages, and fighting wild beasts. The fighting system can also be compared to that of the Tomb Raider franchise; players "lock on" to one enemy and then circle around, dodging attacks and returning attacking with a gun, a whip, or fists. Furthermore, there are numerous collectibles hidden in various places which Indy must climb, swim, crawl, and swing to get to. Some items are required finds, while others are bonuses that unlock various special features.[CR]Nintendo 64 Version[CR]From March 1999 to October 2000 a team of eight Factor 5 employees ported the PC version of the game onto Nintendo 64. This version contains numerous improvements such as new lighting, particle system and camera. The music system was changed to use sequenced midi music instead of the PC version's pre-recorded music files and some new compositions were composed by Chris H&#252;lsbeck.[CR]This version of the game only saw release in North America and was only available on the LucasArts online store and at Blockbuster.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Guybrush Threepwood can be unlocked as a playable character via cheats.  Pressing F10 and typing 'Makemeapirate' turns Indiana Jones into Guybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island series. When using the bazooka it will shoot chickens.There is a hidden room in the game which is a replication of the Barbery Coast in 3D from The Curse of Monkey Island.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Return To Peru Bonus Level[CR]Acquire 1,500 IQ Points.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Juno[CR]Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64. While primarily a shooter, the game also contains many platforming elements. The platforming allows for a shift away from linear level progression towards one that encouraged exploration in a manner similar to other Rare produced games, such as Banjo Kazooie. Like Banjo Kazooie, and many platformers of the time, the game contains a huge number of collectible items. Reviewers considered this one of the game's weak points. In addition to an extensive single player campaign, Jet Force Gemini also offered split-screen mulitplayer modes.[CR][B]Storyline:[/B][CR]Juno attacks an enemy.[CR]The game starts with Gemini squadron (Juno, Vela and their trusty dog Lupus) in orbit of the planet Goldwood when they witness an attack upon the the planets native population, a bear like race called tribals. The attackers are the drones of space tyrant Mizar, who sees Goldwood as a valuable resource and the tribals as slaves and easily dispatched if need be. Frustrated at the inaction of their government who believe that Mizar is not a threat the Gemini squadron head towards the planet, splitting off into separate paths. Upon landing Juno is greeted by King Jeff, the leader of the tribals who shows him that Mizar is systematically invading planets and seems to have almost an infinite army. It soon becomes apparent that Mizar wants more than Goldwood's surrounding planets but wants to control the entire universe including the destruction of Earth. With the federation ignoring the threat only the Gemini squadron are left to save Earth.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Juno with Floyd. Floyd is controlled by the second player in Co-Op games. A Tribal is visible on the doorway in the background.[CR]Unlike many shooters, Jet Force Gemini featured a structure similar to 3D platformers of the time. Levels were non-linear, with a focus on exploration and the collection of items to aid the player or allow for further progression. Many levels feature situations where players can take different paths to reach objectives. Later in the game, players are able to visit each planet with any of the available characters. Because the three playable characters posses different abilities, each can access areas inaccessible to the other two. The game's main collectible item is the Tribal, a small Ewok-like creature. Tribals are hidden throughout the levels, and to fully complete the game and defeat Mizar a player must collect them all. This task is impossible during a player's first run through the game, as several Tribals in the earlier levels are unreachable without items gathered later in the game. Additionally, Tribals can be killed either by the the player or enemies. If a specific Tribal is killed, it cannot be collected, and the player will have to replay the level to save it.[CR]Multiplayer Modes[CR]Single Player (limited co-op)[CR]The single player campaign could be played cooperatively once the player rescues Floyd. From that point on another player can control Floyd's gun turrets but not his movements.Battle Mode[CR]The standard deathmatch option of Jet Force Gemini. While the matches could not be customised as heavily as game like Goldeneye, it did allow a few weapon choices and game scoring modes based on time, number of kills or number of lives.Target Practice Mode[CR]This mode is essentially an on rails shooter where the players controlled a cross hair and were taken through a set path on a course where they had to shoot at targets of drones and avoid targets of tribals.Racing Mode[CR]A simple arcade type racing game that is unlocked as a multiplayer option once the mini-game has been completed in the single player campaign.[CR]Development[CR]The original "child" designs for Vela and Juno. Lupus' design remained largely unchanged.[CR]Like another Rare game for the Nintendo 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Jet Force Gemini's character designs underwent significant changes during development. When the game was first shown at E3 in 1999, the protagonist characters, Juno and Vela were portrayed as children with large chibi-style heads. This elicited a negative response from show attendees, and the characters were changed to their final more "adult" versions.[CR]During development the game was slated to make use of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak accessory. This functionality was dropped, but boxes for the game still advertised it as Expansion Pak compatible. To correct this error, boxes for the game had a sticker placed over the Expansion Pak logo. The sticker correctly stated that the game utilized the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Jet Force Gemini a fairly positive response from reviewers, with the most common complaints focusing on the game's high difficulty and the game's requirement that players save every tribal.[CR]Rerelease[CR]Jet Force Gemini is one of the 30 games included in Rare Replay for the Xbox One.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>John Romero's Daikatana</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]John Romero's Daikatana (also known as simply Daikatana) is a science-fiction/fantasy first-person shooter developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos for the PC and Nintendo 64 (ported by Kemco) on April 14, 2000. It was re-released on Steam on October 1, 2013. Designed by id (and Ion Storm) co-founder John Romero, the game is known for being a critical and commercial flop due to both its overhype and continuous obsolescence thanks to its complicatedly-long development cycle, aggressive marketing, outdated graphics, and reliance on its flawed A.I. companions.[CR]Players control Hiro Miyamoto, a martial arts instructor in a futuristic, dystopian Japan (set in 2455 A.D.) where the world is run by powerful corporations (the most powerful owned by the ruthless Kage Mishima). After learning from a feeble old man (Toshiro Ebihara) that the current timeline is actually an alternate timeline after Kage has taken control of the Daikatana (a powerful, magical sword that allows its wielder to travel through time), Hiro (along with Toshiro's daughter Mikiko and a mercenary named Superfly Johnson) must recover the sword and, while traveling throuhg time, return Earth to its normal state.[CR]The game is known for having four separate time periods (ranging from the magical fantasy past to the technological sci-fi future), each with their own unique architecture, enemy types, and player arsenal (5-6 unique weapons per time period). These include future Japan (circa 2455 A.D.), ancient Greece (1200 B.C.), medieval Norway (560 A.D.), and near-future San Francisco (2030 A.D.). The game also includes an RPG-like experience system, where players can level up their character throughout the course of the game (or a single multiplayer match) and acquire significantly boosted strength, speed, and vitality.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Daikatana is primarily a first-person shooter in the style of John Romero's previous work on titles such as Doom and Quake. The focus of the setting is based around traveling through time with the power of the Daikatana, from dystopian, futuristic Japan to ancient Greece, the Dark Ages of Europe, and near-future San Francisco. An attempt was made at improving on the traditional formula by the player having two AI-controlled sidekicks - Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara. At any given time, the player can direct each sidekick to follow, wait, attack and take objects, but their AI was extremely poor, and if either of the sidekicks died, the game was over. Despite the heavy marketing focus on these sidekicks, this aspect of the game was specifically cited by many reviewers as a major negative towards Daikatana.[CR]In the Nintendo 64 version of the game, Superfly and Mikiko do not appear outside of cutscenes and are thus not part of the gameplay; ironically, this lack of one of the most touted features of the PC version was seen as one of the best parts of the otherwise poorly-reviewed N64 version.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]2455 CE (Common Era): Japan01.

Training Center[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game begins in the year 2455 AD, where the world is run by corporations - the most powerful owned by the ruthless Kage Mishima. The opening sequence depicts a young martial arts teacher named Hiro Miyamoto practicing late one night in his dojo. A sick, old man named Toshiro Ebihara appears on the dojo's doorsteps claiming to be a descendant of a group of skilled warriors known as the Ebihara Clan. He explains that centuries ago the Mishima's were a powerful clan that ruled with an iron fist and a bloody sword that only the Ebihara clan would dare oppose. In response to this the Mishima clan employed the services of a legendary swordsmith, an ancestor of Hiro. The swordsmith crafted a sword so powerful, it had the ability to manipulate time itself. The blade was named the "Daikatana" and through the blade, the swordsmith saw the evil that would befall the world if it was ever given to the Mishima clan. Instead, the swordsmith offers the Daikatana to the Ebihara clan and they promptly use it to utterly decimate the Mishima tyranny. Seeing how dangerous the sword could be in the wrong hands, the swordsmith threw the Daikatana into the centre of a volcano.[CR]Toshiro then goes on to explain that in his youth, he was wealthy and funded an expedition to the volcano to recover the Daikatana, but after Kage Mishima learned of this he stole the Daikatana and used its power to travel back in time to make his clan powerful once again. The current, bleak timeline where Mishima rules most of the world is not the way the world is meant to be. Toshiro also claims that Kage Mishima is responsible for the "MMP" virus that plagues the world and keeps the population under his control, as only he owns the vaccine. Hiro, unsure exactly where he fits into all of this is then asked by Toshiro to rescue his daughter, Mikiko, who has been training all her life to use the Daikatana and has recently been captured by Mishima's forces. As Hiro is about to decline, assassins suddenly appear taking the two men by surprise. Hiro is knocked unconscious and Toshiro is mortally wounded.[CR]When Hiro awakes, Toshiro is on the verge of death. He convinces Hiro to save Mikiko and Hiro, hiding inside a coffin carried by a Mishima truck, he begins his quest.[CR]Development[CR]Daikatana was meant to be what John Romero originally wanted Quake to be. Largely inspired by Chrono Trigger and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Romero wanted Quake to be a first-person action-RPG with a time travel theme, but the rest of id Software wanted it to be a sci-fi gothic FPS. In the end, it turned out to be neither, and was instead a fairly standard shooter with much the same imagery as Doom, just with primitive polygonal graphics instead of sprites. After some major arguments against the team at id, Romero was fired from the company and later formed Ion Storm (along with long-time pal Tom Hall).[CR]From very early on in the game's development, Daikatana was aggressively advertised as the brainchild of John Romero, a man famous for his work at id Software in the development of Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom and Quake. Time magazine gave Romero and Daikatana glowing coverage, saying "Everything that game designer John Romero touches turns to gore and gold." One infamous early advertisement for Daikatana, created by marketer Mike Wilson and approved by Romero, was a red poster with large black lettering proclaiming "John Romero's about to make you his bitch", a reference to Romero's signature trash talk during gaming. Nothing else was featured on this poster but a small tag-line reading "Suck It Down," an Ion Storm logo and an Eidos logo. The advertisements tarnished the company's image.The infamous Daikatana ad[CR]Romero originally completed his design concept for Daikatana in March of 1997. The design document that he had come up with called for a large amount of content. Included in this document were details for 24 levels, 12 weapons and 64 different types of monsters. Despite this utterly huge undertaking Romero remained convinced that development for the game could somehow be completed within the frame of 7 months, in time for Christmas '97.[CR]Romero's growing company Ion Storm had licensed the already-established Quake engine to power the game. id software had completed content development for the much less ambitious Quake in the frame of 6 months with 9 artists. John Romero figured that given these numbers , he could complete the same amount of work on Daikatana in the period of seven months with eight artists. John Carmack at id Software, was quoted in a June 1997 issue of TIME magazine as saying that there was "no chance" Romero would finish a game with 35 weapons and 64 monsters by Christmas 1997. Naturally, he turned out to be right.[CR]"It's just inside the edge of possible to do a commercial first-person shooter in 12 months. Raven [Software] did it with Heretic 2, but that is the only positive case. Even if I thought John had exactly the same positive conditions that Raven had, it wouldn't have been possible to build the company from scratch and still do it. With the combination of John's issues that led to us firing him and the huge game design he was proposing, the idea of getting it done for Christmas 1997 was just patently ludicrous."-John CarmackDaikatana Alpha in 1997[CR]The truth of the matter was that Romero didn't have enough of an established, experienced team to handle the project. At the time that all of this was going on, Ion Storm was still being built as a company, hiring in new staff, many of which were only mod makers and not experienced game designers/ programmers. Ion Storm first showed Daikatana at E3 1997, and the game was still running in software mode, which made it look underwhelming at the time. Romero went to see the id Software booth and was stunned by Quake II's dynamic colored lighting, and believed there was no way Daikatana could compete against Quake II's hardware acceleration. He decided to license the new Quake II engine to stay ahead of the competition, but there was one problem: id's contract specifically stipulated that a licensee couldn't use the new engine until id's game was released in December 1997, the same time Daikatana was scheduled to release. The switch forced Ion Storm to scrap eleven months worth of development.Romero, pictured in Ion Storm's lavish offices.[CR]Romero was confident that the game engine switch would reach the March 1998 deadline (only three months after the previous deadline!) but little did he know it was not that easy. In fact, his staff was against the switch and hated the decision. Romero seemed to have no idea how much work it was going to take just to implement the bare essentials of his four-hundred-page Daikatana design document. Eidos was displeased with Ion Storm's slow progress and the executives were worried that the company were spending millions of Eidos's money lightly. Compounding the belief that Romero was passive in his involvement was the perception that he wasn't working as hard as he could on Daikatana. It all started with John Carmack's comment to TIME magazine in 1997 that "after [Romero] got rich and famous, the push to work just wasn't there anymore." The online community also picked up on this theme, and before long Romero was depicted as a playboy with little interest in doing more than deathmatching all day long.[CR]Romero denied the claim that his heart wasn't in Daikatana, saying, "I'm here more than anyone in this company, period. Eidos is here every day and they know how hard I work." Besides Eidos, Tim Schafer, the designer of Grim Fandango and Psychonauts, said that Romero definitely did care about making a good game. According to Schafer, there was only one thing to say about Romero's interest in his game: "The dude cares."[CR]"In crunch mode on Grim [ Fandango], I sometimes wouldn't answer my e-mail until two in the morning. When I did, there would often be a response from John within a second, or even a phone call. I'd be like, 'John, it's two AM here in California; it must be like four in Texas. What are you doing at work?'" [Romero then replied] "I'm working on Daikatana. It's going to rock."-Tim Schafer[CR]Tensions began to arise between Romero and his staff and he fired a few of them one by one. In November 1998, eight members of the Daikatana team left Ion Storm in frustration and formed their own company: Third Law Interactive (originally Bloodshot Entertainment). In January 1999, Daikatana's basecode completed its switch to the Quake II engine. The switch had been scheduled to only take weeks, instead taking an entire year. Although plans had been made to have the game done by February 1999, they missed their deadline and were forced to push the game back still further. A demo of the game was released, but it underwhelmed many players due to the fact that it only included multiplayer death match, something that has ironically been lost on modern developers, who frequently put out multiplayer-only demos for no apparent reason. Ion Storm tried to make up for the demo's disappointment by making a more impressive singleplayer demo for that year's E3.[CR]Unfortunately, last-minute changes to the game's code and other issues had the game running at a less-than-impressive 12 frames per second. At this time Eidos became fed up with the project, given that it had funded the game for $25 million at that point. In June, 1999 Ion Storm and Eidos came to an agreement which resulted in Eidos receiving majority ownership of the company. In August, 1999, Daikatana's lead programmer Steve Ash left the company and Shawn Green (ex-id Software member) was his replacement.The Daikatana development team[CR]Daikatana was officially and finally released on April 14th, 2000, and after all the anticipation, excitement, and hype the game built over the years, Daikatana received overwhelmingly negative reviews. GameTrailers.com named Daikatana as the second most disappointing game of the decade, surpassed only by the MMORPG Star Wars: Galaxies.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Romero buys the first copy of Daikatana[CR]Daikatana only sold 200,000 copies upon release. Several common criticisms include:Poor AI implementation: One of the main criticisms was the enemy and sidekick AIs, which were profoundly unintelligent. Sidekicks would ignore orders from the player and get themselves killed by environmental hazards, including seemingly innocuous level elements, such as doors. Most enemies displayed minimal strategy and would simply charge the player head-on.Hard difficulty: Romero admits that he made a marketing blunder by making Daikatana a very difficult game with few save points and many death traps (although the saving system was much improved through a patch) Many players found the first opening level difficult and annoying, with its swarms of mosquitoes and squishy stampedes of robotic frogs.Outdated graphics: Running on the already-outdated Quake II engine, Daikatana looked technically unimpressive when compared to other games that were out at the time, such as Quake III: Arena and Unreal Tournament (which used brand-new game engines)[CR]Daikatana was considered to be one of the biggest disappointments in video game history because it did not live up to the hype Romero and Eidos created. It tarnished Ion Storm's reputation because of its poor quality and Romero's lavish rock-star lifestyle, which included the company's multimillion dollar office on the top floor of a Dallas skyscraper.[CR]Eidos reported a major loss of profit from the game's development costs and sales and fired many of the Ion Storm staff; including Romero, Tom Hall and Stevie Case. The three formed Monkeystone Games, a small company focusing on mobile games. Many believe the fallout from Daikatana sidelined Romero's career in the high-end PC gaming industry forever.[CR]Romero has said in recent interviews that he regretted some of the decisions he had made with Daikatana. He was actually against the "bitch" ad at first because he would never call anyone "his bitch" in his whole life. He admitted his regret for not rejecting it when marketer Mike Wilson presented him with the idea, as it ruined his connection between the fans and the community.[CR]"You know, I never wanted to make you my bitch, not you, not them, not any of the other players and, most importantly, not any of my fans. Up until that ad, I felt I had a great relationship with the gamers and the game development community, and that ad changed everything. That stupid ad. I regret it and I apologize for it. You know, when the ad was first presented to me, I knew it was risky, and I didn&#8217;t want to do it. It didn&#8217;t make sense. I mean, there&#8217;s the whole culture of smack talk that goes with games, and especially the FPSes, and that was something I was known for. While the game could have been better on a number of levels, that ad and the hype that preceded and followed it was clearly a marketing failure and that was followed by my failure to stop it. Even if I had come out with a brilliant game, it wouldn't have mattered. The ad nearly insulted everyone who read it."- John Romero[CR]The Nintendo 64 version received particularly harsher criticism than the PC version. Due to its rushed development, the graphics were poor, with blurry textures and a short draw distance. The characters Superfly and Mikiko were removed from gameplay but could still be seen in cutscenes. The version of Daikatana for the Game Boy Color however, was surprisingly well-received by the critics, and is considered one of the better titles for the handheld console.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The Daikatana soundtrack was released on October 6th, 2005 and the music comprised of classical, electronic, chorus, rock, and metal genres. It came in two separate discs (dubbed Volumes 1 and 2) and it was published by Dominus Animae, As of now, the soundtrack is out of print. All music was composed by Will Loconto, Stan Neuvo and Will Nevins, except Slow Doom by Bobby Prince.Volume 1[CR]Total Tracks: 17[CR]Total Time: 53 minutes[CR]1.

Alongside Cruis'n USA, the abandoned port was one of the first titles announced for the N64. When Nintendo realized however that the N64 wouldn't be ready for a holiday 95 release, it was decided to make a port for the Super Nintendo insead. With a port already released the team decided to work on a port of Killer Instinct 2 for the N64 instead.[CR]Killer Instinct 2 and Killer Instinct Gold may share the same story. Unlike the arcade version of Killer Instinct 2, Killer Instinct Gold did not have any FMV due to the lack of space on the N64 cartridge. To further conserve space, some frames of animation were removed and the backgrounds were rendered in 3D.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]FulgoreJagoSpinalT.J. ComboGlaciusSabrewulfB.

		<title_clean>Kirby 64 - The Crystal Shards</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (known in Japan as Kirby of the Stars 64) is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer developed by HAL and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 on March 24, 2000 (in Japan), June 26, 2000 (in North America), and June 22, 2001 (in Europe).[CR]The sixth main installment of the Kirby series (starring the pink puffball of the same name), The Crystal Shards expands on the previous platformers by introducing 3D graphics (still in a 2D movement plane) and the ability to merge two abilities together into a single powerful ability (giving him 35 total abilities). While Kirby does not have any animal friends or multiplayer "Helpers" from some of his previous games, he can enlist Waddle Dee, and Adeleine, and King Dedede for help at certain points in the game. The game also includes some some competitive multiplayer mini-games (for up to four players, with each player as either Kirby, Waddle Dee, Adeleine, or King Dedede).[CR]The game's story involves the Crystal, a sacred treasure of Ripple Star (a planet populated by fairies). When the planet is invaded by Dark Matter, one of the fairies (Ribbon) escapes with the Crystal only to crash land onto Pop Star (with the Crystal shattered into many pieces throughout the galaxy). It's up to Kirby and his friends to gather all the Crystal Shards throughout six different planets and cleanse Ripple Star of Dark Matter.[CR]The Crystal Shards was digitally re-released (via Virtual Console) for both the Wii (on February 25, 2008) and the Wii U (on July 30, 2015). The Wii version was also used in the Kirby's Dream Collection compilation to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series.[CR][B]Abilities:[/B][CR]While there are seven core abilities in the game, Kirby can merge two abilities into one combination ability (by either inhaling both ability enemies at the same time, by spitting an ability enemy onto another, or by transferring his ability into an Ability Star and throwing it an ability enemy to create a combination Ability Star). There are twenty-eight combination abilities in the game.Stand-alone AbilitiesBomb: Allows Kirby to throw bombs in front of him.Cutter: Kirby throws his face in the shape of a boomerang. His walking speed is slower when using this ability.Fire: Kirby transforms into a ball of fire that propels him forward for a brief amount of time.Ice: Kirby breathes ice that freezes enemies when hit.Needle: Kirby grows spikes that kill enemies, Kirby also sticks to any surface when using this ability.Spark: Electricity surrounds Kirby, hurting any enemy that he touches.Stone: Kirby turns to stone and squashes anything that's under him, Kirby can still move around in this form but the ability stops if Kirby falls off a ledge.Combination AbilitiesBomb+Bomb: Kirby shoots up to 3 rockets from his mouth.Bomb+Cutter: Kirby throws ninja stars that explode on impact with an enemy.Bomb+Fire: Kirby shoots fireworks and can launch himself in the air.Bomb+Ice: Kirby turns into a snowman that detonates on impact with an enemy.Bomb+Needle: Kirby turns into a Gordo, and when Kirby explodes he shoots needles around him.Bomb+Spark: Kirby turns into a light bulb that explodes after a brief amount of time.Bomb+Stone: Kirby throws dynamite that explodes after a brief amount of time. This can also damage Kirby if the player does not push down to put Kirby's hard hat on.Cutter+Cutter: Much like the stand alone Cutter ability, except the range of the Boomerang is bigger and the actual Boomerang is bigger.Cutter+Fire: Kirby gets a fire sword that he can swing around. The sword can be thrown and can also hurt enemies when it is dragged from behind.Cutter+Ice: Kirby puts on ice skates and skates along the level.Cutter+Needle: Kirby's arms grow into fangs that close when Kirby is on the ground to attack anything around Kirby.Cutter+Spark: Kirby uses a light saber-esque weapon to attack enemies.Cutter+Stone: Kirby transforms into stone, and then carves himself into some of Kirby's friends. The friends include Rick the Hamster, Coo the Owl, Kine the Fish, Pitch the Bird, Chuchu the Octopus, and Nago the cat.Fire+Fire: Much like the stand alone fire ability. Except Kirby travels further in a ball of fire, and there is more fire so the range is larger.Fire+Ice: Kirby gets put into a block of ice, which then melts away.Fire+Needle: Kirby transforms into a bow that shoots flaming arrows.Fire+Spark: Kirby gets caught on fire making him run around, hurting any enemies he touches.Fire+Stone: Kirby transforms into a volcano, and is able to shoot rocks at enemies.Ice+Ice: Kirby rolls into a big snowball, hurting any enemy he touches.Ice+Needle: Kirby transforms into a giant snowflake.Ice+Spark: Kirby transforms into a refrigerator, and can hurl food at enemies. Kirby can also eat the food to regain life.Ice+Stone: Kirby transforms into a curling stone that slides along the ground.Needle+Needle: Similar to the stone alone needle ability, except the spikes are longer. The spikes are actually a fork, a needle, a bee's sting, a cactus, a corkscrew, a pencil, and protractor.Needle+Spark: Kirby transforms into a needle that conducts lightning.Needle+Stone: Kirby has a power drill that drags him forward, hurting the enemies it hits.Spark+Spark: Similar to the stand alone spark ability, except the spark is larger.Spark+Stone: Kirby spits out a large rock that is lassoed by electricity, giving it a boomerang effect.Stone+Stone: Similar to the stand alone stone ability, except Kirby is much bigger.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Open up Boss Battles[CR]You can boss battles by beating O2.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get Kirby to say Hiiii....[CR]At the title screen hold L,R and Z, while holding those push the A button and Kirby will say ''hii!''[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] High Mini-Game Difficulties[CR]To access the higher difficulty settings for the mini-games, you must beat the difficulty setting before it. In the beginning, beat the Easy setting to unlock the Normal level. Beat the Normal level to open the Hard level. Then, beat the Hard level to access the Intense difficulty level.</plot>

Through an unprecedented cooperative effort, the New Frontier Plan members had built an orbiting space station; life on Mars would soon be a reality. [CR]This plan for developing Mars was officially named the "Mars Frontier Project" (MFP). At the end of the 21st century, a domed structure called the "Plant" was built on Martian soil, and colonization finally began. The first wave of colonists applied themselves to terraforming the planet for human survival; adjusting the atmosphere and securing water resources. [CR]Half a century passed. On Mars, the air was breathable, and oceans formed as the southern ice caps continued to melt. Trees and shrubs gradually flourished; Mars was evolving from a planet of red dust into a lush, green environment. At the beginning of the fifth emigration wave, MFP officials received an alarming report from the Martian colonists; "Unknown lifeforms were appearing near one of the colonies." [CR]Upon receiving the reports, key government officials on Earth were alarmed. To protect the colonists, the United Nations established a military relay station on the Martian moon Phobos and built a military post on Mars itself. This was the opportunity that restless armed forces worldwide had been awaiting. One day troops patrolling an undeveloped part of Mars discovered ancient ruins with what appeared to be signs of alien life. A reconnaissance unit was immediately dispatched; they reported that the ruins were of a civilization destroyed around the 11th century, Earth time. One theory was that the restored atmosphere had awakened the previously dormant Martian creatures, who had been sighted in the area in the past. [CR]Soon after this the trouble began. First, communications from one of the other colonies was suddenly cut off. Then, one after another, each of the other colonies as well as the military post lost all communication channels. An investigative party could leave immediately from Earth but would require several days to reach Mars. The United Nations therefore ordered a test squadron for a new type of experimental assault aircraft, stationed on Phobos, to investigate and eliminate the disturbances on Mars. [CR]Soon after the squadron was airborne, transfer station monitors received the final communication from the military post on Mars: &#8220;Mayday! Mayday! What is that?! It&#8217;s crawling on the surface&#8230; It&#8217;s attacking!! Mayday, mayday!&#8221;[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Legend of Zelda, The - Majora's Mask</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released on October 26, 2000, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is the follow-up to previous Nintendo 64 favorite The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Majora's Mask features several technological upgrades over its predecessor, as well as new game mechanics, such as a time travel element which can be used to influence events in the game's non-linear structure. The game was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo.[CR]Critical reception was almost unanimous in favor of the game, with many critics praising the game's darker story, the time travel element, its non-linearity, and the evolution of Ocarina of Time's gameplay systems. Fan reception was more mixed, as is typical with a major Zelda release, with some fans complaining about the game's departure from the norm, as well as the reduced accessibility. In 2010, Majora's Mask was voted as "Game of the Decade" by users of GameFAQs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Link "Z targets" an enemy.[CR]The actual mechanics of controlling Link are identical to the mechanics in Ocarina of Time. Link moves with the analog stick, can lock on to enemies with the Z button, and equip three items to the three C buttons. The core sword-fighting handles exactly the same as it was in Ocarina of Time, as is playing the Ocarina and using items. However, unlike the previous installment, there is a much greater emphasis on time management, since Link is constantly on the clock. The game starts Link at 6:00 AM on the First Day (which can be observed on the new Clock icon at the bottom of the screen, displaying the time and the date) and the Moon will destroy Termina at 6:00 AM on the Third Day.[CR]Since the seventy-two game hours last approximately fifty-four minutes of real time, it seemed, at the outset, that the game had provided Link with an impossible task. However, upon completing the game's tutorial level (in which Deku Link is confined to the city, allowing the player to see how the seventy-two hour cycle affected the game world) Link reclaims the Ocarina of Time. Playing the Song of Time on the Ocarina (identical to the version in Ocarina of Time) would warp Link back to the beginning of the First Day, starting again at 6:00 AM. By traveling back to the beginning of the First Day, the player has, effectively, an infinite amount of time to do everything needed in order to complete the game.By playing the Song of Time, Link can return to the dawn of his first day in Termina.[CR]More importantly, the passage of time can be slowed down significantly by playing the Inverted Song of Time, the notes of the Song of Time backwards. While this slows down the in-game passage of time, it does not slow down Link's perception of time, giving the player just over two and a half hours to complete tasks in a given cycle.[CR]To create a game that utilizes the player's need to travel back in time every two and a half hours, the entire game is designed around "scheduled events." Similar to the system used in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, every single character in the game world operates on their own "schedule." Non-player characters (NPCs) will appear in certain places only at certain times, and certain events can only be witnessed at certain times and at specific places. Link can learn the schedules of the various in-game characters by investigating them and (automatically) recording the information in his journal. The Journal can then be used to help Link meet up at specific locations to complete side missions, unlock the path to the next dungeon, or complete a dungeon altogether. Link can use this journal to be at the right place at the right time, allowing him to solve the puzzles necessary to move foreword, and complete NPC quests in order to earn items key to progressing in the game.[CR]When the end of the Third Day draws near, Link can then warp back to the beginning of the First Day and continue on his journey through the same three days again. However, warping back to the start of the first day means that everything in the world moves back to the first day. All the puzzles solved to go to new areas are now again unsolved. The NPCs won't remember that Link solved their problems, because he hasn't done it yet. All the quests Link completed are no longer completed. Furthermore, once Link goes back in time, he loses all of the weapon ammunition he has collected (such as arrows and deku nuts) as well as all of the Rupees carried in his wallet and the small/ Big keys he obtained from the game's dungeons. Link will not, however, lose any masks, songs, sword upgrades, Rupees stored in the bank, or items obtained over the past three days.[CR]This design setup, initially, seems maddening, but the game provides a few ways to mitigate the headache of repeating the same sections over and over again over seventy-two hours. First, Majora's Mask effectively splits game progression into three parts. To move forward in the game, the player must first go to the unique zone where the next objective is located. Next, the player has to find the entrance to the dungeon in the zone. Finally, the player has to complete the dungeon. Each of these steps can be completed in two-and-a-half hours and completing each of these steps rewards Link with a way to avoid repeating the puzzles/dungeon/traveling over and over again.Heart Containers are one of several items which are spared the negative effects of time travel.[CR]Completing the first two steps (going to the new area or finding the entrance to the dungeon) will usually put Link close to a warp point (in the form of an owl statue). By playing the Song of Soaring, Link can warp to any of these statues once having discovered them. Because songs and warp points don't disappear when Link travels back in time, the player can often times find the warp point, go back the beginning of the First Day, warp to the newly discovered point, and continue the game from there. This keeps the game&#8217;s time limit from being too unmanageable, as it simply encourages the player to play the game in chunks, completing one section, going back in time and moving onto the next section.[CR]Defeating a dungeon's main boss will reward Link with a part of the Oath of Order, a song that can summon the four giants, protectors of Termina who are Clock Town's only hope in stopping the Moon. Just like the warp song and warp points, going back in time doesn&#8217;t cause Link to forget the song. Thus, all the player has to do is complete each of the game's four dungeon's once in order to learn the full Oath of Order to use against Skull Kid, the game's primary antagonist.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask, the antagonist of the game.[CR]Shortly after defeating Ganondorf and saving Hyrule in Ocarina of Time, Link sets off on a new journey to reunite himself with "a lost friend," implied to be Navi the Fairy. With Epona and the Ocarina of Time, Link travels to a mysterious forest when he encounters the Skull Kid. Armed with the great power of Majora's Mask, the Skull Kid steals the Ocarina of Time, scares Epona away, and magically turns Link into a Deku Scrub. As Deku Link gives chase to Skull Kid, he inexplicably finds himself inside a mysterious clock tower. Inside, Link is greeted by the Happy Mask Salesman from Ocarina of Time, from who the Skull Kid stole Majora's Mask, claiming that it holds a terrible power. The Happy Mask Salesman tasks Link with recovering the mask within seventy-two hours, before, the Happy Mask Salesman claims, he must leave the town.The game begins:[CR]The town in question is the bustling locale of Clock Town, in the land of Termina (a parallel world to Link's Hyrule). After stepping outside the Clock Tower, Link (and the player) understand the reason they have only seventy-two hours to recover the Mask: the Moon is falling from the sky. Using the power of the dark mask, Skull Kid has turned the Moon into a terrible monster and has willed his creation to crash into Termina in seventy-two hours, precisely three days from the moment Link exits the clock tower.[CR]Three days later, with the Moon threatening to crush Clock Town and destroy all of Termina, Link gets the Ocarina of Time back from the Skull Kid in Clock Town. He remembers the Song of Time and plays it as soon as he picks it up. This magically rewinds time to the beginning of the three days, when he first met the Happy Mask Salesman. Link and the Salesman seem to be the only ones who remember everything that happened in those three days. The Happy Mask Salesman sees the instrument in Link's hands and teaches him the Song of Healing which returns him to his original form, transforming the curse into a Deku Mask that will allow him to become a Deku Scrub at will. In return, the Happy Mask Salesman once again asks that Link retrieve Majora's Mask. To do so, he must venture into the four regions surrounding Clock Town and acquire the masks worn by four evil monsters. Only then can he face the Skull Kid and retrieve the mask. Now, Link has to once again take up the sword, and find a way to defeat Skull Kid, recover Epona, and stop the Moon from destroying Termina.[CR]Masks[CR]Transformation MasksLink's Deku Scrub transformation form.[CR]Over the course of Majora's Mask, Link will acquire a variety of masks that can confer various abilities. After completing the initial tutorial section, Deku Link learns the Song of Healing, and playing the song turns Link back to his human form, while containing the Deku form into a Deku Mask. Wearing the Mask at any time (which can be equipped to the C buttons like any other item) will turn Link back into the Deku scrub, while taking it off returns Link to Human form. Along with the Deku Mask, Link can find a Goron Mask (turning Link into a Goron) and a Zora Mask (turning Link into a Zora). These transformation masks are the more important of the game's 24 masks, as the game requires Link to switch between the various forms (Human Link, Deku Link, Goron Link and Zora Link) to complete puzzles and defeat Bosses. Each of the forms has specific abilities that the player can use to solve these puzzles.Link's Goron transformation form.[CR]Human Link is the most versatile of the 4 forms, and can use all of the items in the game that he finds during his travels (like the bow and hookshot, etc.). Human Link can pull himself onto ledges, grab onto heights, and has the greatest maneuverability in combat. Deku Link is too short to grab ledges, and cannot swim in water (the form can hop across Water, but after five hops, Link falls into the water and drowns). Deku Link can use magic to fire a magical spitball at opponents to stun them, as well as to pop balloons in the air. Deku Link can also launch out of flower pads, and use large petals as propellers to float to a new location (giving Link a float after his jump for more Air Control. Goron Link is extremely heavy, very slow in normal combat, has a hard time pulling himself up ledges, and is damaged greatly by Water. The Goron Mask lets Link, however, curl into a ball and roll at opponents, even growing spikes to damage enemies and break boulders (much like Sonic the Hedgehog). Zora Link can breathe underwater and swim much faster than Human Link. He can also use his fins as boomerangs (much like the Boomerang in Ocarina of Time), but the form has no melee attacks.Link's Zora transformation form.[CR]While only Link can use the various weapons in the game, all four forms can use the Ocarina of Time and play songs to solve puzzles. Each form creates a different instrument when the Ocarina is selected; Deku Link pulls out a large Organ and keyboard, Goron Link grabs a huge set of bongo drums, and Zora Link uses a marlin skeleton as a Guitar. In addition to these three masks, there are 21 other masks spread throughout the game. While many of the masks can be collected simply through normal game progression, many of the masks can only be earned by completing a certain NPC's quest (usually tied to that NPC's schedule, requiring Link to do something specific at a certain time). To collect the Fierce Deity Mask (the 24th and final Mask, which greatly increases Link's power and defense), the player will have to complete every sub quest in the game, which means collecting the other 23 masks. Like the weapons, songs and warp points, Masks aren&#8217;t lost when Link travels to the beginning of the "First Day."Additional MasksAll Night MaskAll Night MaskThis mask has one use only: to listen to Anju's Grandmother's stories, which normally make Link fall asleep.Listen to the first story (Carnival of Time) and choose all the top answers to receive a Piece of a Heart.Listen to the second story (Four Giants) and choose "I dunno" to receive another Piece of a Heart.To get it, on the First Night at 12:00 AM, Link has to stop Sakon the Thief from stealing the Bomb Bags from the Old Lady, or else those will be at the Curiosity Shop later.Then, on the Final Night at 10:00 PM, Link can buy the All-Night Mask at the Curiosity Shop for 500 Rupees.Bomb MaskBomb MaskWear this mask and press B to explode. Nothing else to it really. Use this when Link is out of Bombs.Hold R immediately after Link presses it to not take any damage!To get it, save the Old Lady in North Clock Town on the First Night at 12:00 AM from being robbed by Sakon the Thief. She'll give Link this as a reward.Bremen MaskBremen MaskWear this and press B to parade small animals around.Link can use it at the chicken coop at Romani Ranch to make all of the ten baby chicks grow up instantaneously one by one. Grog will reward Link with the Bunny Hood.To get it, go to the Laundry Pool in Clock Town during the First or Second Night and talk to Guru-Guru who is practicing there by himself. He will talk about the past and give Link the mask he stole because he doesn't need it anymore.Bunny HoodBunny HoodWear this to run twice as fast, thus, jump twice as far! This is extremely useful.Also, wear this while playing the Postman's Timing Game to see the timer for the full 10 seconds.To get it, go to the chicken coop at the back of Romani Ranch and use the Bremen Mask to parade the ten baby chicks around. If Link gets all of them, they will one by one grow up. Once they are all finished, Link will receive his prize.Captains HatCaptains HatWear this to speak with and command the warriors of Ikana, the Stalchildren (skeletons).To get it, play the Sonata of Awakening to the giant skeleton built into the wall near Damp&#233;'s house. Chase him down and kill him. Once he's defeated, run up the trail and speak with him.He will then grant Link the contents of the chest behind him. After he disappears, Link must jump to the other side using the Bunny Hood, the Zora Mask, or get as close as he can and Hookshot to the chest.Couple's MaskCouple's MaskWear this and talk to the people arguing in the Mayor's Office to make them stop. Afterwards, talk to the Mayor by himself to receive a Piece of a Heart.To get it, complete the Anju &amp; Kafei Quest. Go to that section to see how.Circus Leader MaskCircus Leader MaskThis mask has one, simple use in the game. To cause the thieves (the Gorman Brothers) to stay far away when chasing Link and Cremia on the way to Clock Town through Milk Road.To get it, go to the Latte Milk Bar during the First or Second Night and play each part of the song for Toto the band leader of the Indigo-Go's in all four forms. Gorman will cry and give this mask in thanks.Deku MaskDeku MaskWear it with (C) to assume Deku form. Use (C) to change back.This allows Link to interact with other Deku Scrubs, stun enemies, hop on water, use flowers to fly, as well as shoot bubbles once he learns it from the Great Fairy. Because Link is made of wood, fire is his weakness in this form.To get it, Link must get back his Ocarina of Time from Skull Kid and speak with the Mask Salesman.Don Gero MaskDon Gero MaskAfter Goht is defeated, the whole Snowhead area will begin turning back to normal. In the lake in Mountain Village (where the Smiths are) there are some lily pads and a lone Frog. We have to find the other four frogs and bring them here by talking to them with the Don Gero Mask on. When that is done, return here and talk to them using the mask to receive a Piece of a Heart.To get it, Link must light the torches in the Goron Shrine after he puts the Elder's Son to sleep with the Goron Lullaby.

Play the Song of Healing to put the spirit of Mikau the guitarist into a mask.[CR]Graphics[CR]Majora's Mask was created using an updated, more robust version of the Ocarina of Time engine. Part of the game's superior visual fidelity is due to the game's required use of the Nintendo 64 "Memory Pak." The expanded RAM capacity of the pak (8 MB instead of the initial 4MB inside the N64) allowed for more detailed character models than seen in Ocarina of Time, as well as higher resolution textures and less "fog" obscuring objects in the distance (meaning a longer draw distance). The pak also provided slight improvements to the game's frame rate, as well as superior lighting effects.Dance the time away![CR]While the game looks better than its predecessor, Majora's Mask still retains the art design seen in Ocarina of Time. While many of the game's textures, locations, and effects are new, character models were lifted straight out of Ocarina of Time and only slightly changed for the new game. For instance, the Twinrova witches (the boss fight from Ocarina of Time's spirit temple) were potion sellers in Majora's Mask, and the Kakariko/Hyrule Castle soldiers now patrol the streets of Clock Town. Some of the character models aren't altered in the slightest from Ocarina of Time, but most of them have been upgraded. For example, Link looks distinctly different from the appearance of "Young Link" in Ocarina of Time.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Disc 1 (59:40)Disc 2 (59:05)Title Screen (2:13)Forest Ambush (1:11)Forest Chase (0:50)Clock Tower Cavern (1:44)Majora's Theme (1:32)The Clock Tower (1:39)Mask Salesman (0:53)Clock Town Day 1 (1:29)Fairy's Fountain (1:10)Mayor Dotour (1:36)Milk Bar Latte (1:26)Guru-Guru's Song (1:16)Clock Town Day 2 (1:07)House (1:10)Kamaro's Dance (0:45)Store (1:14)Sword Training (1:05)Complete a Heart Piece (0:05)Clock Town Day 3 (1:09)Keaton (1:23)Target Practice (1:13)Rosa Sisters' Dance (1:07)Mini Game (1:07)Final Hours (2:08)Astral Observatory (1:24)Song of Time (1:41)Ocarina Song of Time (0:13)Ocarina Song of Healing (0:08)Song of Healing (1:23)New Song (0:12)A New Mask (0:07)Inverted Song of Time (0:11)Song of Double Time (0:12)Termina Field (1:31)Gaebora's Theme (1:07)Battle (1:36)Game Over (0:10)Open Chest (0:10)Item Catch (0:06)Small Item Catch (0:05)Southern Swamp (1:44)Kotake's Potion Shop (1:35)Woods of Mystery (1:14)Boat Tour (1:55)Court of the Deku King (2:28)Ocarina Sonata of Awakening (0:05)Sonata of Awakening (0:25)Ocarina Song of Soaring (0:05)Song of Soaring (0:10)Surfacing of Woodfall (0:06)Woodfall Temple (1:20)Mini Boss (2:07)Woodfall Clear (0:19)The Four Giants (1:40)Ocarina Oath to Order (0:08)Oath to Order (0:25)Gorman Bros.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released in Japan on November 21, 1998, and in North America two days later. It was the first Zelda game to be produced in 3D, and creator Shigeru Miyamoto was almost universally praised for smoothly transitioning Zelda into the 3D space and preserving the feel of the franchise. Ocarina of Time is the fifth game in the series and was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development division for the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Legend of Zelda series' first appearance on the Nintendo 64 brought many of the franchise's mainstays along with it. There are dungeons with forest, fire, and water themes, for instance, and trademark weapons and items like the bomb and boomerang are also available. Because it was the first 3D game in the series, many innovations made their first appearance in the game play. This is the first game to feature a lock-on targeting system whereby Link can circle around and direct his attacks at the targeted enemy. The so-called "Z-targeting" system was subsequently adopted by numerous third-person action games.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Great Deku Tree.[CR]In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule, the Great Deku Tree served as the guardian spirit. The children of the forest, the Kokiri, lived with the Great Deku Tree. Each Kokiri had his or her own guardian fairy, except one. His name was Link.[CR]This is where the game begins, with the player as Link, a simple young boy living with the Kokiri tribe who are elf-like children that never grow up and can never leave the Kokiri Forest. After having an inexplicable dream, the game's hero, Link, is awakened by a guardian fairy named Navi. She explains that the Great Deku Tree has summoned him and there is no time to waste. After searching the town for the Kokiri Sword, and finding enough rupees to buy the Deku Shield, Link is allowed to enter the presence of the Great Deku Tree. Link finds out that he has been summoned to attempt to save the Deku Tree from death after being cursed by an evil man. After defeating the curse, but failing to save the Great Deku Tree, Link is told the origin of the world of Hyrule&#8230;..[CR]"A long time ago . . .[CR]Before life began, before the world had formed, three golden goddesses descended upon the chaotic land of Hyrule.[CR]They were Din, the goddess of power, Nayru, the goddess of wisdom and Farore, the goddess of courage.[CR]Din, with her strong flaming arms, cultivated the land to create the earth.[CR]Nayru poured her wisdom onto the earth to give the spirit of law to the world.[CR]Farore's rich soul created all life forms who would uphold the law.[CR]These great goddesses returned to the heavens, leaving behind the golden sacred Triforce.Since then, the Triforce has become the basis for Hyrule's providence.[CR]Where the Triforce Stood became sacred land."The Triforce - A sacred object left by the gods in Hyrule.[CR]The Deku Tree then reveals that the &#8220;wicked man from the desert&#8221; that cursed him was searching for one of three sacred stones, the keys to opening the door of time located in Temple of Time and gaining access to the Triforce. After giving Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, the Deku Tree tells Link that he is different from all the other Kokiri and has a destiny that lies beyond the forest. Before he dies he sends Link to search out the other two spiritual stones, and specifically to the Hyrule Castle. As the story unfolds it is learned that Link needs to stop the &#8220;wicked man from the desert&#8221;, named Ganondorf, from gaining access to all three pieces of the Triforce and gaining the full power of the Goddesses.[CR]Just as Link leaves Kokiri Forest, his old friend Saria gives him the Fairy Ocarina. A musical device capable of playing numerous melodies. As he steps onto Hyrule Field, he meets a wise owl, Kaepora Gaebora, who gives advice to Link on his quest. Link makes his way across the Hyrule Field and eventually arrives at Hyrule Castle. He storms through the market and reaches the castle gate. It is here that he meets Malon, a dairy maid and daughter of the owner of Lon Lon Ranch, who she gives him an egg after stating that her dad is missing after doing a milk delivery. Being refused entry to the castle, Link climbs up some vines around the side of the gate and sneaks past all the guards to get into the castle. The only way in being a small trapdoor on the side of the building. However, this is blocked by a sleeping Talon, the missing owner of Lon Lon Ranch. Not being awoken by normal methods, Link waits a night and a day and the egg hatches into a Cuckoo. The Cuckoo wakes up Talon, who runs back home after he realizes that Malon is upset. Link now sneaks into the castle via the small trapdoor.[CR]As he goes into the Castle, there are more guards patrolling the grounds. Link successfully sneaks past them and is greeted by Princess Zelda. She tells the story of how Hyrule was created and how Ganondorf, the Gerudo King, is trying to harness the power of the Triforce for himself. After agreeing to help the Princess, Link meets Impa, nurse of Zelda, who teaches him Zelda's lullaby and escorts him out of the castle, but not before giving him a note to allow him to climb Death Mountain.[CR]Once back in Hyrule Field, Link goes back to Kokiri Forest to get Saria's Song, as it is one of the Goron's favorite songs. However, Saria is nowhere to be seen, so Link searches for her and ends up in the Lost Woods, an eerie forest which seems to be an endless maze. After Link makes his way through the Lost Woods, with the help of Kaepora Gaebora, he eventually finds Saria sitting on a tree stump. It is here Link learns Saria's Song, this allows him to ask for Saria's advice whenever he needs it wherever he may be. Link makes his way to Death Mountain, and his second Spiritual Stone.[CR]Making his way back through Hyrule Field, Link heads for Kakariko Village, at the base of Death Mountain. Once here, he shows the guard guarding the entrance to Death Mountain, the letter that Impa gave him and Link is granted permission to make his way up the dangerous mountain. Avoiding various Tektites and other dangers, Link finally arrives at Goron City. Encountering a locked door, Link plays Zelda's Lullaby and meets Darunia, who refuses to talk to him as he is a bad mood. To brighten the atmosphere, Saria's Song is played and Darunia breaks into dance. Finally being in a good mood again, Darunia gives link the Power Bracelet, which allows him to pick up Bomb Flowers. Using this new found strength, Link picks up a Bomb Flower and blows up the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern.[CR]Link makes his way through Dodongo's Cavern, fighting various enemies such as Keese, Lizalfos and Dodongos. He obtains the dungeon's treasure which are bombs. This allows him to carry bombs with him instead of depending on Bomb Flowers and the Goron Bracelet. Link makes his way through the dungeon and eventually reaches King Dodongo. After defeating King Dodongo and ridding Dodongo's Cavern of any threats, Darunia congratulates Link making him a 'brother' and gives him the second spiritual stone, the Goron's Ruby.[CR]With two out of the three spiritual stones obtained, only the Zora's Sapphire remains. Link makes his way to the Zora domain, gaining entrance by playing Zelda's Lullaby. He speaks to the king of the Zoras who tells him that his daughter, Princess Ruto is missing and asks Link to go find her. Link can then take part in a diving game which if he completes, it will give him the silver scale. Using his new found ability to breathe underwater for longer, Link uses the secret entrance to Lake Hylia found in Zora's domain. It is here that he finds a message in a bottle. The message states that Princess Ruto has gone to see Jabu Jabu. Link shows the king this message and the king allows him to pass. Jabu Jabu has been acting strangely recently and when Link feeds him a fish, Jabu Jabu engulfs Link.[CR]When inside Jabu Jabu, Link finds Princess Ruto, who is rather rude. Link has to escort her around the body while avoiding the enemies that plague the area. As Link reaches the end of the dungeon, he fights the dungeon boss using his new found boomerang. Once defeated, Princess Ruto is saved and she gives him the Zora's Sapphire as an engagement present stating that she will get married to Link in the future.[CR]Now that Link has all three spiritual stones he makes his way back towards Hyrule Castle. As he reaches the gates of the market place, he sees Zelda and Impa ride out on horseback, Zelda notices Link and throws the Ocarina of Time back into the moat surrounding the castle. Just after they disappear, Ganondorf comes storming through the gates and asks Link where the princess went. He refuses to answer and then is hit by Ganondorf's thunderball.[CR]When Link awakens, he jumps into the moat and finds the Ocarina of Time and proceeds to the Temple of Time. He opens the Door of Time by placing all three spiritual stones on the alter, this reveals the Master Sword resting in the Pedestal of Time. After Link unsheathes the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time he unknowingly and unwillingly gives Ganondorf access to the Sacred Realm.Map of Hyrule, from The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time[CR]Ocarina of Time takes place in two different time settings with players controlling both young Link and adult Link. The game starts when Link is a young boy trying to stop Ganondorf from gaining the Triforce. Upon gaining access to the Temple of Time and the Master Sword, Link travels seven years into the future. Link learns that the time travel happens because, although Link is the chosen one to remove the Master Sword from its stone sealed sheath, he must be of a certain age to wield it. Therefore Link is trapped in a sort of &#8220;hibernation&#8221; until he is old enough to fulfill his destiny. When Link awakens he finds that in his absence, Ganondorf has used the Triforce of Power to take control of Hyrule and turn it into a post-apocalyptic world. Link must now embark on a quest to save the once beautiful land of Hyrule.[CR]Control Scheme[CR]In a situation similar to the development of Super Mario 64 (released in 1996), Nintendo faced the difficult task of translating one of gaming's most beloved franchises into 3D, which meant a complete overhaul of the series' classic design mechanics.Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.[CR]Unlike the previous, top-down 2D Zelda games, Ocarina of Time utilized a completely 3D view. The player could control both Link's direction and the velocity of movement via the Analog Stick. The camera in Ocarina of Time floated around Link (as opposed to the greater camera controls in Super Mario 64), and could be instantly directed behind Link by pressing the Z button. Although the B button permanently controlled use of the sword, the games various other items (such as the Bow and the Hookshot) could be mapped onto the Left, Right, and Down C-Buttons, allowing Link to access more of his weaponry without pulling up a menu.[CR]Nintendo brought two major control innovations to bear in Ocarina of Time. The first, and most obvious, new control feature was Lock-On Targeting (referred to as Z-Targeting in the game). Pressing the Z button when Link was near a person, enemy, sign or interactive part of the environment caused the camera to lock onto the target (in game, Link's fairy, Navi, would fly to the nearby target and Link would turn his eyes directly towards Navi's new location). From the locked on position, Link could strafe around his target, use rolls and flips to dodge enemy attacks, and easily interact/talk to NPCs in three dimensional space.[CR]The idea of locking on to a target was revolutionary: game programmers and designers, who were trying to understand how characters would be able to physically interact in 3D, couldn&#8217;t understand how to make a game with the same type of tight control they could achieve in a 2D perspective. Characters could never line up properly with their targets and movement speed was too slow. Many games had control schemes that confused players. In Ocarina of Time however, players could instantly face and run directly to characters, would always be facing toward an enemy, and had more control over Link.[CR]The second key innovation of Ocarina of Time was the creation of the context-sensitive buttons. Rather than map every single one of Link's abilities to a different button on the N64 controller, or only provide Link with a handful of abilities, Nintendo mapped many "secondary" control features to the A button. When in a certain situation or "context" (in front of a door, near a block, in combat, playing the Ocarina, riding Epona), the on-screen A button would display a word, indicating what the button could currently be used for (e.g. opening doors, pushing blocks, jump attacks in combat, putting the Ocarina away, speeding Epona up). This was a more subtle change to the series, but Context-Sensitive buttons became the industry standard way for developers to assign controller buttons, using permanent assignment only for important actions, while letting a player use "secondary functions" only in the proper context.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.[CR]Perhaps the biggest surprise for players who purchased the game was that, despite the new perspective, brand new controls, and 3D graphics, Ocarina of Time was still a full-blooded Zelda game. Sticking to its roots, the game led players through nine different dungeons, having them complete tricky puzzles and defeat big bosses along the way.[CR]Ocarina of Time, like the Zelda games that came before it, is primarily an exploration and puzzle solving game, with sword combat, horseback riding, and boss fights playing providing a change of pace. The player progresses through the game by guiding Link to one of the nine dungeons and collecting a mystical artifact at the end (three jewels in the first half of the game, six medallions in the second half). Each of these dungeons is filled with puzzles that hinder Link's progress, and the player must solve them to continue their quest. In every dungeon (after the first one) players will encounter a "Sub-Boss", a powerful enemy that the player will be forced to do battle with. Defeating the Sub-Boss will lead the player to an item that will be necessary to solve puzzles farther in the dungeon. At the very end, players will encounter the Boss of the dungeon, who can only be defeated with tactical use of the new weapon retrieved in the dungeon (and some well placed sword slashes).Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3D[CR]Puzzles in the dungeons often share very basic similarities (there's quite a bit of time spent pushing blocks, standing on switches, and pushes blocks onto switches). However, each dungeon has a "theme" that changes the way the player moves through the dungeon. The Water Temple, for example, can only be beaten if the player raises and lowers the water levels, which they can only do at specific parts of the dungeon. The Shadow Dungeon, on the other hand, is filled with invisible walls and traps, not to mention mirages. The player can only see through these disguises with the Lens of Truth.[CR]Main Characters[CR]Ocarina of Time boasted a cast of dozens of characters, including both series stalwarts (like Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon) while also introducing new denizens of the land of Hyrule that would go on to be featured in later installments of the series.Link: The Hero of TimeYoung Link[CR]The main character of Ocarina of Time, and the protagonist of nearly all the Legend of Zelda games (with rare exception). Like previous Zelda games, the player may choose any name they want for the main character(including their own), but the default character name is Link. The name Link, according to Shigeru Miyamoto, comes from a literal interpretation of what the main character is in a video game: a link between the player and the game.[CR]The Link featured in Ocarina of Time is not a continuation of his adventures from the NES, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo games, but a whole new Link in a whole new story unrelated to those previous games. Ocarina of Time helped to cement the fact that the Legend of Zelda games were not a series of stories connected together in a linear timeline, but rather a retelling of the same story: different plot details, character interactions, and action sequences may occur, but the core theme(boy saves princess/world) remains the same throughout many of the main story.[CR]The player will eventually control two different "versions" of Link: first as a boy, and then later as a young adult, after he travels forward in time 7 years. This older incarnation of Link is widely regarded as the most popular representation of the series' protagonist, and fan clamor for a game starring the older, more "mature" Link was so strong that Nintendo obliged with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in 2006 for both the GameCube and Wii, which were designed around the mature Link aesthetic.[CR]Link begins Ocarina of Time as a small boy, a native of the Kokiri tribe designated as protectors of the forests of Hyrule. Link is still a child in the eyes of his peers; he's the one member of the tribe that has not been granted a fairy, a companion sprite to help him out in the world (hence his early-game nickname, "The Boy without a Fairy). At the outset of the game, Link is trouble by strange dreams, visions of a man dressed in black from the west whose presence seems to be a threat (effectively predicting the invasion of Hyrule by Ganondorf and the Gerudo Tribe).Adult Link[CR]As Link is awakened from his slumber, he meets Navi, the fairy and companion throughout the game. Link has been tasked by the Guardian of the Great Deku Tree, to remove a dark curse planted inside it by the Court Adviser and dark Wizard Ganondorf (the Gerudo man seen in Link's dreams). Despite Link's triumph over the monster deep inside the Tree's Roots, Link was too late to save the Great Deku Tree, as the curse had already taken its toll. With it's last wish, the Great Deku Tree gave Link a quest: he must leave the forest and travel across the world to Hyrule, and present a mysterious green stone, the Kokiri Emerald, to Princess Zelda, implying that she would know how to stop Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule.[CR]Link's journey will take him to the Princess Zelda, and together the two would hatch a plan to defeat Ganondorf by acquiring the Triforce, the mystical relics that helped to preserve the land and make it flourish after the goddesses created Hyrule. The Triforce was also the object of Ganondorf's desires, as the mystical triangles were able to grant any wish the holder of the relic desired. Link and Zelda decided to get to the Triforce before Ganondorf by getting to the Triforce first. To access the Sacred Realm (where the Triforce has been stored by the gods), Link must locate two more sacred stones, the Goron's Ruby and the Zora's Sapphire. Together with the Kokiri Emerald, Link and Zelda are able to open the Door of Time. When Link draws the fabled Master Sword from its pedestal from behind the door of time, he opened the Sacred Realm and access the Triforce. However, Ganon managed to get the Triforce before Link and Zelda, and with his first wish, the dark wizard declared himself the new ruler of Hyrule.[CR]When Link returns to consciousness, he finds himself inside the fabled Chamber of Sages. Inside, he is given his next task by Rauru, the Sage of Light. In order to combat Ganon and deliver Hyrule from evil, Link must awaken the other 5 sages, denizens of Hyrule that must take on the mantle of protectors of the Triforce and Hyrule. Only Link, the legendary Hero of Time (with the power to travel between the past and future) can defeat Ganondorf's evil forces. With the power of the awakened Sages, Link would be able to seal Ganondorf away inside the Sacred Realm for all time.[CR]Upon obtaining all 6 of the Sage Medallions (designators that the sage has been awakened), Link learns that Ganondorf only managed to grab one piece of the three pronged Triforce. Ganondorf possessed the Triforce of Power, while Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Courage would help give Link the strength to rescue the Princess Zelda and defeat Ganondorf once and for all.Princess Zelda / SheikPrincess Zelda (Young)[CR]The titular character of the Legend of Zelda series, Princess Zelda is a member of Hyrule's royal family. The young princess is the only member of her family that suspects Ganondorf's treachery, fearing that his true interests are to take control of the Triforce (which the Royal Family is sworn to protect).[CR]Link first meets Princess Zelda at the behest of the Great Deku Tree. His task was to take the Kokiri Emerald to the Princess. After sneaking his way into the castle and avoiding guards in the Castle Royal Gardens, Link finally makes his way into Zelda's room and private garden. At first, Zelda was surprised that the young boy had managed to sneak past the guards, but when she discovers that Link had arrived in the Castle from the forest, and had a fairy companion, Zelda remembered the dream she had of the boy emerging from the forest with a fairy, and was convinced that Link was the one destined to help her keep the Triforce away from Ganondorf. Zelda tells Link of her fears about the dark wizard, and together, the two children hatch a plan to protect the Triforce from Ganondorf's evil.Princess Zelda (Adult)[CR]To open the Door of Time and Access the Sacred Realm, the pair would need to play the Song of Time on Zelda's greatest treasure, the Ocarina of Time, passed down throughout the Royal Family.[CR]However, before Link and Zelda use the Sacred Stones to open the Door of Time, Ganondorf begins his coup in Hyrule Castle and chases the Princess and her guardian Impa from the Castle. As they cross the gate to Hyrule Castle Town, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the moat for Link to recover, imbued with a secret message from the princess that teaches Link how to play the Song of Time. The young Princess Zelda won't be seen again until the player has completed the game.[CR]When Link awakens in the Temple of Time seven years in the future, he is greeted by the mysterious Sheik, the last surviving member of the Sheikah, a tribe dedicated to the protection of the royal family. Sheik describes to Link the new world, one controlled and maintained by Ganondorf from the safety of Hyrule Castle. Sheik points Link towards the first Sage, the Sage of the Forest, and gives Link hints about the tools he will need to help save and awaken the various Sages. Sheik will eventually teach Link special "warp" songs that will instantly whisk the Hero of Time to the entrance of the five dungeons, or send him back to the Master Sword's pedestal at the Temple of Time, making the navigation of Hyrule much easier.[CR]After Link awakens all six Sages, he returns to meet Sheik at the Temple of Time. Sheik tells Link that, although Ganondorf was the ruler of Hyrule, his victory of the land was not complete. Ganondorf only possessed one piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Power. Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Wisdom, on the other hand, was bound on the hand of a mysterious "seventh sage", the leader of the other six. To Link's (and the player's) shock, Sheik removes his mask and vestments, and reveals himself to be none other than the Princess Zelda! Her disguise was a ruse to keep the Princess out of Ganondorf's clutches to protect the Triforce of Courage. As the legendary Seventh Sage, Zelda uses her power to grant Link a weapon, the mystical Arrows of Time, that could penetrate any darkness and fill it with light. However, upon revealing her true self, Ganondorf captures the Princess and brings her to Hyrule Castle. Only Link can rescue her from his clutches, so he sets off to Ganon's castle, and ascends to the top and faces the Evil King. Zelda is released upon Link's victory, but the tower starts to collapse, and the two have to escape before they're buried along with it. She helps open the gates that will lead the two to the exit and escape just as the building is destroyed. After a final battle between Link and Ganon, Zelda uses her powers to hold Ganon in place so Link can deliver the final blow to the beast. She then uses her powers in conjunction with the six sages to seal Ganon within the Sacred Realm. With Hyrule saved, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood, where he is supposed to be.Navi the Fairy"Hey!" "Listen!"[CR]Navi is one of the mysterious fairy's of the Deku Forest. We are introduced to Navi at the very start of the game when she wakes Link from his nightmare, telling Link the Deku Tree has sent her to aid Link on his journey.[CR]Navi is the secondary character that the player controls throughout the game with the new and innovative Z-Targeting mechanic. When the player presses and holds the Z-button, Navi will float over the nearest target in order to keep the players attacks directed to that object or enemy. As well as being a part of a mechanic, Navi is also one of the first characters to have voice acting. She will occasionally yell out "Watch Out" if there is something Link needs to....well, watch out for. She also says "Hey" when she has something important to tell Link, followed by a "Listen" when the player presses the Up C-button. After doing so Navi will give a hint as to what the player  should be doing next in terms of the story line, just in case they are lost.GanondorfGanondorf[CR]Ganondorf (aka Dark Lord, Great King of Evil, and Man from the West) is the main villain in Ocorina of Time as well as most of the other Zelda games. Ganondorf is from the Gerudo Tribe which is made up primarily of women except for their King and is located in the desert to the west of Hyrule. Ganondorf came to power by simply being the chosen male child to be born every hundred years. He then uses his status as King of the Gerudo to make peace with the King of Hyrule and become an adviser to the king. As a young child Princess Zelda senses something dishonest and evil about Ganondorf as he is making a truce with her father. It is through this suspicion that Princess Zelda recruits Link to help her keep Ganondorf from achieving his goal, whatever it may be. Little do they know that Ganondorf will actually use Link as a pawn to get to the Triforce.The Six SagesForestSariaSaria Main page: SariaThe sage Link saves from the Forest Temple, Saria is also a childhood friend of Link's. Unlike the other Kokiri that teased Link for lack of having a fairy, Saria spent time and often played together. When Link is told by the Great Deku Tree to leave the forest and go to Hyrule Castle, Saria gives him a Fairy Ocarina as a memento. Some moments later in the game, Link returns to the forest and finds Saria in the Sacred Forest Meadow, which is also the entrance to the Forest Temple as an adult. Here Saria teaches Link a new song for his Ocarina, that can let him communicate with Saria if he needs any advice. After becoming an adult and gaining the Hookshot, Link returns to the Sacred Forest Meadow, Saria's favorite spot, to see she isn't there. After fighting through the temple and defeating Phantom Ganon, Saria is saved and is awakened as the Sage of Forest, and gives Link the Forest Medallion.FireDaruniaDarunia Main page: DaruniaDarunia is the second sage to be awakened, and is another character Link meets in his youth. In a grouchy mood initially, Link makes him happy and dancing when he plays Saria's Song. Darunia tells Link of the Goron's predicament, their main food supply in Dodongo's Cavern being cut off by a massive boulder, and promises to give him the Spiritual Stone of Fire, Goron's Ruby, if he destroys the boulder and the monsters inhabiting Dodongo's Cavern. Link defeats the monsters and earns Darunia's respect by becoming his "Sworn Brother." They would soon meet again when the ancient dragon Volvagia was released in Death Mountain, and the two worked to free the Gorons and defeat the beast. Upon doing so, Darunia was awakened as the Sage of Fire, and grants Link the Fire Medallion.WaterRutoRuto Main page: Princess RutoPrincess of the Zoras, Sage of the Water Temple, and another childhood friend of Link. The King Zora asked of Link to find his daughter inside Lord Jabu-Jabu's belly. The reason she was inside? To find her precious gem Zora's Sapphire, the Spiritual Stone of Water. She is initially reluctant and rude towards Link, as she does not want his help. However, after saving her and defeating the monster inside Jabu-Jabu, she becomes impressed by Link's skills, and gives him the stone on the promise that he will marry her. Seven years later, Zora's Domain is frozen, and Ruto travels to the Water Temple to find out the problem. Link catches up, and Ruto had not forgotten the promise they made, though they both realize that there are other matters at hand. After navigating the temple and defeating Morpha, Ruto is awakened as the Sage of Water, presents the Water Medallion to Link.ShadowImpaImpa Main page: ImpaImpa was Zelda's handmaid, and took care of her in her youth. After Link and Zelda meet at the castle, Impa teaches him Zelda's Lullaby, which serves him many purposes, mainly to show connection with the Royal family. She is last seen in Link's youth, riding off from Hyrule Castle Town as Ganondorf is in pursuit of Zelda and the Ocarina of Time. Seven years later, Kakariko village comes under attack by the evil spirit Bongo Bongo, and Impa heads into the Shadow Temple to stop the creature. Link follows as well and defeats the creature, overcoming the illusions of the temple. Upon awakening Impa as the Sage of Shadow, Impa reassures Link that Zelda is safe, and gives him the Shadow Medallion.SpiritNabooruNabooru Main page: NabooruGanondorf's Second in Command, well originally, Nabooru finds Link as a child in the Spirit Temple, and the two decide to work towards finding out the Gerudo King's schemes, though not before Koume and Kotake capture Nabooru, Link is left to finish the job and explore the rest of the temple as an adult. The two witches had taken Nabooru and brainwashed her as an Iron Knuckle, and is forced to fight Link. Link breaks the spell over Nabooru, and Koume and Kotake, rather irritated, casts a spell on Nabooru transporting her to parts unknown. Link must then defeat the two witches in their separate and combined form Twinrova, and with their hold on the temple gone, Nabooru is freed and awakened as the Sage of Spirit, and gives Link the Spirit Medallion.LightRauruRauru Main page: RauruThe Light Sage who resides in the chamber of sages, Rauru wakes up Link from his seven year slumber after removing the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time. He takes the time to explain to Link what has happened to Hyrule in his absence, how Ganondorf was able to get his hand on the Triforce and become the King of Evil. After providing this exposition on events, he sends him back to the Temple of Time, after handing him the Light Medallion.The Seventh SageZelda's Alter-Ego, Sheik.[CR]A childhood friend of Link's are revealed to be the seventh sage. During his quest as an adult, Zelda disguised herself as Sheik and taught him new songs for his Ocarina as well as updating him on the events around Link. After returning to the Temple of Time after awakening the sages, Sheik arrives, provides more exposition on the Triforce, and reveals herself not only to have the Triforce of Wisdom, but also to be Zelda. She uses her powers to grant Link the Light Arrows, the only weapon to destroy Ganondorf, and along with the other sages seals the Evil King in the Sacred Realm.[CR]Songs[CR]Link can play a variety of songs on his ocarina. Some can be used to warp to specific locations, others have an effect on NPCs. Here's a run down of the most notable ones:[CR] Whenever Link needs to show his connection to the royal family, he plays this song. Initially to open Darunia's chamber, but subsequently whenever he sees a Triforce sign.[CR] Lets Link talk to Saria whenever he likes. She'll give advice on what to do next, much like Navi. Perhaps more importantly, it can be played to Darunia to cheer him up.[CR] Summons Epona; instrumental in the quest to obtain her as an adult, but rather useless as Young Link. It also entices the cows to give Link milk if he has a free bottle.[CR] Turns Night to Day and Day into Night. Playing the song in a area where time doesn't pass in real time will return Link to the most recent exit.[CR] Opens the Door of Time and also moves "Time Blocks" in general.[CR] It makes rain start and thunder sound in the background. Can be used to make beans sprout into a transportation vine, often leading to hidden and otherwise unreachable areas.[CR]Key Equipment[CR]Kokiri Knife - The primary sword used by Young Link, as when he claims the Master Sword he transitions into Adult Link. The weakest of all of the swords with the smallest range.Master Sword - The main sword of the game. The second strongest sword. Can be used by Adult Link only. When placed back in the Temple of Time, the player resumes as Young Link.Giant's Knife - Two-handed, breaks easily.Biggoron's Sword - Two-handed, does not break. Requires completing a long task with many steps before it can be acquired.Deku Shield - The first shield in the game. This is an item that cannot be used by adult Link. This is the primary shield for Young Link as it is the only shield that he can use to actually protect himself. The flaw with this shield is that it burns up if it comes into contact with any fire.Hylian Shield - The Hylian Shield is the main shield throughout the game. It can be used for all the same things as the Deku Shield with the added benefit of being able to block fire attacks. Young Link can actually equip this shield, however it is too heavy for him to lift. When holding the trigger to block as Young Link with the Hylian Shield equipped Link simply crouches, protecting his back from damage. The only difference between this shield and the mirror shield is that it cannot reflect light.Mirror Shield - The Mirror Shield is the third shield in the game. It is found in the Spirit Temple. The mirror shield has a shiny surface and is used to be a surface to bounce light off of. This is important for completing the Spirit Temple and beating the Spirit Temple boss, Twinrova.Kokiri Tunic - Standard green tunic. Link begins the game wearing it.Goron Tunic - Protects against heat. Red in color.Zora Tunic - Lets Link breathe under water. Blue in color.Iron Boots - The Iron Boots are found in the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon right before entering the Water Temple. These boots are equipment modifiers like the Hover Boots and the Tunics in the game. When equipped the boots slow down Link and make him take very heavy steps. This is used to have link sink to the bottom of water so he can walk on the surface. This is necessary for completing the Water Temple.Hover Boots - The Hover Boots are procured in the Shadow Temple and act as one of the equipment modifiers in the game as opposed to a C-Button item. When these are equipped Links steps become slippery as if he were running on ice. The benefit is that Link can run between two platforms and float a small distance between them which is good for gaining some distance.Ocarina of Time - The Ocarina of Time is the second Ocarina that Link gets in the game. The first one is the Fairy Ocarina. The Ocarina of Time can be played to warp the the entrance areas of every Temple in the game.Deku Stick - These fragile sticks are a consumable weapon much like bombs. They are dropped from Deku Babas. The sticks have a long range and one of the highest damage modifiers in the game. They can also be lit and used to light sconces and torches, which is used to solve puzzles.Fairy Slingshot - The Fairy Slingshot is the first dungeon item found in the game. It is found inside the tree dungeon as Young Link. This acts as Young Link's primary ranged weapon as the Fairy Bow acts the same way for adult Link.Fairy Bow - The Fairy Bow is the first dungeon item found as adult Link. The Fairy Bow is found in the Forest Temple. The Fairy Bow is needed to beat Phantom Ganon and is very helpful in handling final Ganon at the end of the game. It is often used for puzzles throughout the game. There are three elemental modifiers which can be added to the arrows. The Fire Arrows are good for lighting torches on fire. The Ice Arrow is good for freezing enemies. And the Light Arrow is strong against evil.Hookshot / Longshot - The Hookshot is needed to enter the Forest Temple as Link. This makes it one of the first necessary items to procure as adult Link. The Hookshot can be received after racing Dampe in the Kakariko graveyard. The Longshot is an upgrade for the Hookshot and acts as the dungeon weapon for the Water Temple. The Longshot is needed to reach the final boss room of the Water Temple. The Longshot is also needed for beating the Water Temple boss, MorphaMegaton Hammer - The Megaton Hammer is found in the Fire Temple as Link. Using the C-Button that the hammer is attached to can cause the hammer to be swung horizontally to knock barriers out of the way, or hammered vertically downward to crush things. The Megaton Hammer is crucial for beating the boss of the Fire Temple, Volvagia. The Megaton Hammer is also the best way to defeat the Shadow Link mini-boss in the Water Temple. Since Shadow Link copies all sword attacks that regular Link uses switching to the Megaton Hammer confuses Shadow Link.Lens of Truth - The Lens of Truth is one of the dungeon items in Ocarina of Time. The Lens of Truth is found in the first half of the Shadow Temple when Young Link goes into the Bottom of the Well mini-dungeon. Much like the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon before the Water Temple the player receives a key item needed for Link to complete the following dungeon. The Lens of Truth is used to spot fake walls and other hidden things which Link can walk through or on. The Lens of Truth is crucial for Adult Link to navigate the Shadow Temple. It is also used to fight the Shadow Temple's boss, Bongo Bongo.Bottles - There are four bottles to be obtained throughout Ocarina of Time. Bottles can be used to store potions, milk, fairies, or Poe ghosts. To use items like the Poe ghosts or fairies there is no need to equip the bottle. Fairies will automatically resurrect Link with full health when he dies, and the Poe ghosts can be cashed in by simply talking to the vendor.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time received universal critical acclaim and had a huge commercial success. It was the best selling game of 1998, with up to 2.5 million sales, even though it was released only 39 days before the end of the year. The game was praised for the intuitive controls, depth, and wonderful story. The games received Perfect 10 scores from numerous websites and magazines and won many Game Of The Year Awards. Ocarina of Time has often been called the greatest game of all time and to this day remains a classic.[CR]Nintendo 3DS Remake[CR]It was announced at E3 2010 that Ocarina of Time would be getting it's first real remake on Nintendo 3DS with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. The graphics, aside from being presented in full stereoscopic 3D and in 30 frames-per-second, have been greatly improved with redrawn textures and completely redone character models. Significant updates to the gameplay like being able to switch the Iron Boots on and off from the touch screen were also included. The game includes a mirrored version of version of Ocarina of Time: Master Quest, the harder alternate version of the game with re-arranged dungeon puzzles and other smaller changes.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]1."Title Theme"1:202."Enter Ganondorf"0:133."Deku Tree"0:364."Fairy Flying"0:235."House"0:366."Kokiri Forest"1:017."Open Treasure Box"0:108."Item Catch"0:049."Small Item Catch"0:0510."Shop"1:0811."Battle"1:0712."Inside the Deku Tree"1:2713."Boss Battle"1:1914."Boss Clear"0:1315."Heart Container Get"0:0516."Legend of Hyrule"1:5817."Spiritual Stone Get"0:1618."Fairy Ocarina Get"0:1119."Hyrule Field Main Theme"4:4320."Kepora Gebora's Theme"1:0021."Market"0:5922."Shooting Gallery"0:3923."Hyrule Castle Courtyard"0:5324."Enter Zelda"0:0625."Ocarina "Zelda's Lullaby""0:1226."Zelda's Theme"0:4927."Ocarina "Epona's Song""0:0928."LonLon Ranch"2:0829."Mini Game"0:3230."Kakariko Village"1:4431."Ocarina "Sun's Song""0:0732."Hyrule Field Morning Theme"0:3733."Goron City"1:3834."Ocarina "Saria's Song""0:0935."Lost Woods"0:3936."Dodongo's Cavern"0:4637."Middle Boss Battle"1:0738."Dinosaur Boss Battle"1:0839."Zora's Domain"1:3040."Great Fairy's Fountain"0:3541."Potion Shop"0:5242."Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly"0:3443."Ocarina "Song of Time""0:1244."Temple of Time"1:1945."Open Door of Temple of Time"0:1546."Master Sword"0:1347."Ganondorf's Theme"0:4148."Chamber of the Sages"1:4349."Medal Get Fanfare"0:1450."Sheik's Theme"0:3051."Horse Race"0:4652."Horse Race Goal"0:0553."Ingo's Theme"0:3954."Escape from LonLon Ranch"0:0955."Kakariko Village Orchestra Ver."1:4456."Ocarina "Song of Storms""0:0757."Windmill Hut"0:5258."Minuet of Woods"0:1759."Forest Temple"1:5260."Bolero of Fire"0:2061."Fire Temple"0:4262."Ice Cavern"0:4563."Serenade of Water"0:1964."Water Temple"1:4465."Nocturne of Shadow"0:2366."Prelude of Light"0:1867."Shadow Temple"1:4568."Gerudo Valley"1:3469."Spirit Temple"2:5770."Requiem of Spirit"0:2471."Kotake &amp; Koume's Theme"0:5272."Meet Again Zelda"0:5173."Game Over"0:0974."Ganon's Castle Bridge"0:2275."Ganon's Castle Under Ground"0:5376."Inside Ganon's Castle"3:2677."Ganondorf's Battle"1:1278."Escape from Ganon's Castle"0:3379."Last Battle"2:1080."Seal of Six Sages"0:2981."Ocarina of Time"0:3282."End Credits"7:10[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug/Error Mode[CR]NOTE: There is always a possibility your game data can be corrupted, so do this at your own risk![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Elemental Arrows[CR]Complete the task listed to have a cow put in your tree house.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Bowser broach[CR]If you look at the broach that Malon is wearing, you will notice that it is actually Bowser's face.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Free Hylian Shield[CR]When you're a kid you can get the Hylian Sheild for free instead of wasting 80 rupees.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released in Japan on November 21, 1998, and in North America two days later. It was the first Zelda game to be produced in 3D, and creator Shigeru Miyamoto was almost universally praised for smoothly transitioning Zelda into the 3D space and preserving the feel of the franchise. Ocarina of Time is the fifth game in the series and was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development division for the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Legend of Zelda series' first appearance on the Nintendo 64 brought many of the franchise's mainstays along with it. There are dungeons with forest, fire, and water themes, for instance, and trademark weapons and items like the bomb and boomerang are also available. Because it was the first 3D game in the series, many innovations made their first appearance in the game play. This is the first game to feature a lock-on targeting system whereby Link can circle around and direct his attacks at the targeted enemy. The so-called "Z-targeting" system was subsequently adopted by numerous third-person action games.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Great Deku Tree.[CR]In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule, the Great Deku Tree served as the guardian spirit. The children of the forest, the Kokiri, lived with the Great Deku Tree. Each Kokiri had his or her own guardian fairy, except one. His name was Link.[CR]This is where the game begins, with the player as Link, a simple young boy living with the Kokiri tribe who are elf-like children that never grow up and can never leave the Kokiri Forest. After having an inexplicable dream, the game's hero, Link, is awakened by a guardian fairy named Navi. She explains that the Great Deku Tree has summoned him and there is no time to waste. After searching the town for the Kokiri Sword, and finding enough rupees to buy the Deku Shield, Link is allowed to enter the presence of the Great Deku Tree. Link finds out that he has been summoned to attempt to save the Deku Tree from death after being cursed by an evil man. After defeating the curse, but failing to save the Great Deku Tree, Link is told the origin of the world of Hyrule&#8230;..[CR]"A long time ago . . .[CR]Before life began, before the world had formed, three golden goddesses descended upon the chaotic land of Hyrule.[CR]They were Din, the goddess of power, Nayru, the goddess of wisdom and Farore, the goddess of courage.[CR]Din, with her strong flaming arms, cultivated the land to create the earth.[CR]Nayru poured her wisdom onto the earth to give the spirit of law to the world.[CR]Farore's rich soul created all life forms who would uphold the law.[CR]These great goddesses returned to the heavens, leaving behind the golden sacred Triforce.Since then, the Triforce has become the basis for Hyrule's providence.[CR]Where the Triforce Stood became sacred land."The Triforce - A sacred object left by the gods in Hyrule.[CR]The Deku Tree then reveals that the &#8220;wicked man from the desert&#8221; that cursed him was searching for one of three sacred stones, the keys to opening the door of time located in Temple of Time and gaining access to the Triforce. After giving Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, the Deku Tree tells Link that he is different from all the other Kokiri and has a destiny that lies beyond the forest. Before he dies he sends Link to search out the other two spiritual stones, and specifically to the Hyrule Castle. As the story unfolds it is learned that Link needs to stop the &#8220;wicked man from the desert&#8221;, named Ganondorf, from gaining access to all three pieces of the Triforce and gaining the full power of the Goddesses.[CR]Just as Link leaves Kokiri Forest, his old friend Saria gives him the Fairy Ocarina. A musical device capable of playing numerous melodies. As he steps onto Hyrule Field, he meets a wise owl, Kaepora Gaebora, who gives advice to Link on his quest. Link makes his way across the Hyrule Field and eventually arrives at Hyrule Castle. He storms through the market and reaches the castle gate. It is here that he meets Malon, a dairy maid and daughter of the owner of Lon Lon Ranch, who she gives him an egg after stating that her dad is missing after doing a milk delivery. Being refused entry to the castle, Link climbs up some vines around the side of the gate and sneaks past all the guards to get into the castle. The only way in being a small trapdoor on the side of the building. However, this is blocked by a sleeping Talon, the missing owner of Lon Lon Ranch. Not being awoken by normal methods, Link waits a night and a day and the egg hatches into a Cuckoo. The Cuckoo wakes up Talon, who runs back home after he realizes that Malon is upset. Link now sneaks into the castle via the small trapdoor.[CR]As he goes into the Castle, there are more guards patrolling the grounds. Link successfully sneaks past them and is greeted by Princess Zelda. She tells the story of how Hyrule was created and how Ganondorf, the Gerudo King, is trying to harness the power of the Triforce for himself. After agreeing to help the Princess, Link meets Impa, nurse of Zelda, who teaches him Zelda's lullaby and escorts him out of the castle, but not before giving him a note to allow him to climb Death Mountain.[CR]Once back in Hyrule Field, Link goes back to Kokiri Forest to get Saria's Song, as it is one of the Goron's favorite songs. However, Saria is nowhere to be seen, so Link searches for her and ends up in the Lost Woods, an eerie forest which seems to be an endless maze. After Link makes his way through the Lost Woods, with the help of Kaepora Gaebora, he eventually finds Saria sitting on a tree stump. It is here Link learns Saria's Song, this allows him to ask for Saria's advice whenever he needs it wherever he may be. Link makes his way to Death Mountain, and his second Spiritual Stone.[CR]Making his way back through Hyrule Field, Link heads for Kakariko Village, at the base of Death Mountain. Once here, he shows the guard guarding the entrance to Death Mountain, the letter that Impa gave him and Link is granted permission to make his way up the dangerous mountain. Avoiding various Tektites and other dangers, Link finally arrives at Goron City. Encountering a locked door, Link plays Zelda's Lullaby and meets Darunia, who refuses to talk to him as he is a bad mood. To brighten the atmosphere, Saria's Song is played and Darunia breaks into dance. Finally being in a good mood again, Darunia gives link the Power Bracelet, which allows him to pick up Bomb Flowers. Using this new found strength, Link picks up a Bomb Flower and blows up the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern.[CR]Link makes his way through Dodongo's Cavern, fighting various enemies such as Keese, Lizalfos and Dodongos. He obtains the dungeon's treasure which are bombs. This allows him to carry bombs with him instead of depending on Bomb Flowers and the Goron Bracelet. Link makes his way through the dungeon and eventually reaches King Dodongo. After defeating King Dodongo and ridding Dodongo's Cavern of any threats, Darunia congratulates Link making him a 'brother' and gives him the second spiritual stone, the Goron's Ruby.[CR]With two out of the three spiritual stones obtained, only the Zora's Sapphire remains. Link makes his way to the Zora domain, gaining entrance by playing Zelda's Lullaby. He speaks to the king of the Zoras who tells him that his daughter, Princess Ruto is missing and asks Link to go find her. Link can then take part in a diving game which if he completes, it will give him the silver scale. Using his new found ability to breathe underwater for longer, Link uses the secret entrance to Lake Hylia found in Zora's domain. It is here that he finds a message in a bottle. The message states that Princess Ruto has gone to see Jabu Jabu. Link shows the king this message and the king allows him to pass. Jabu Jabu has been acting strangely recently and when Link feeds him a fish, Jabu Jabu engulfs Link.[CR]When inside Jabu Jabu, Link finds Princess Ruto, who is rather rude. Link has to escort her around the body while avoiding the enemies that plague the area. As Link reaches the end of the dungeon, he fights the dungeon boss using his new found boomerang. Once defeated, Princess Ruto is saved and she gives him the Zora's Sapphire as an engagement present stating that she will get married to Link in the future.[CR]Now that Link has all three spiritual stones he makes his way back towards Hyrule Castle. As he reaches the gates of the market place, he sees Zelda and Impa ride out on horseback, Zelda notices Link and throws the Ocarina of Time back into the moat surrounding the castle. Just after they disappear, Ganondorf comes storming through the gates and asks Link where the princess went. He refuses to answer and then is hit by Ganondorf's thunderball.[CR]When Link awakens, he jumps into the moat and finds the Ocarina of Time and proceeds to the Temple of Time. He opens the Door of Time by placing all three spiritual stones on the alter, this reveals the Master Sword resting in the Pedestal of Time. After Link unsheathes the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time he unknowingly and unwillingly gives Ganondorf access to the Sacred Realm.Map of Hyrule, from The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time[CR]Ocarina of Time takes place in two different time settings with players controlling both young Link and adult Link. The game starts when Link is a young boy trying to stop Ganondorf from gaining the Triforce. Upon gaining access to the Temple of Time and the Master Sword, Link travels seven years into the future. Link learns that the time travel happens because, although Link is the chosen one to remove the Master Sword from its stone sealed sheath, he must be of a certain age to wield it. Therefore Link is trapped in a sort of &#8220;hibernation&#8221; until he is old enough to fulfill his destiny. When Link awakens he finds that in his absence, Ganondorf has used the Triforce of Power to take control of Hyrule and turn it into a post-apocalyptic world. Link must now embark on a quest to save the once beautiful land of Hyrule.[CR]Control Scheme[CR]In a situation similar to the development of Super Mario 64 (released in 1996), Nintendo faced the difficult task of translating one of gaming's most beloved franchises into 3D, which meant a complete overhaul of the series' classic design mechanics.Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.[CR]Unlike the previous, top-down 2D Zelda games, Ocarina of Time utilized a completely 3D view. The player could control both Link's direction and the velocity of movement via the Analog Stick. The camera in Ocarina of Time floated around Link (as opposed to the greater camera controls in Super Mario 64), and could be instantly directed behind Link by pressing the Z button. Although the B button permanently controlled use of the sword, the games various other items (such as the Bow and the Hookshot) could be mapped onto the Left, Right, and Down C-Buttons, allowing Link to access more of his weaponry without pulling up a menu.[CR]Nintendo brought two major control innovations to bear in Ocarina of Time. The first, and most obvious, new control feature was Lock-On Targeting (referred to as Z-Targeting in the game). Pressing the Z button when Link was near a person, enemy, sign or interactive part of the environment caused the camera to lock onto the target (in game, Link's fairy, Navi, would fly to the nearby target and Link would turn his eyes directly towards Navi's new location). From the locked on position, Link could strafe around his target, use rolls and flips to dodge enemy attacks, and easily interact/talk to NPCs in three dimensional space.[CR]The idea of locking on to a target was revolutionary: game programmers and designers, who were trying to understand how characters would be able to physically interact in 3D, couldn&#8217;t understand how to make a game with the same type of tight control they could achieve in a 2D perspective. Characters could never line up properly with their targets and movement speed was too slow. Many games had control schemes that confused players. In Ocarina of Time however, players could instantly face and run directly to characters, would always be facing toward an enemy, and had more control over Link.[CR]The second key innovation of Ocarina of Time was the creation of the context-sensitive buttons. Rather than map every single one of Link's abilities to a different button on the N64 controller, or only provide Link with a handful of abilities, Nintendo mapped many "secondary" control features to the A button. When in a certain situation or "context" (in front of a door, near a block, in combat, playing the Ocarina, riding Epona), the on-screen A button would display a word, indicating what the button could currently be used for (e.g. opening doors, pushing blocks, jump attacks in combat, putting the Ocarina away, speeding Epona up). This was a more subtle change to the series, but Context-Sensitive buttons became the industry standard way for developers to assign controller buttons, using permanent assignment only for important actions, while letting a player use "secondary functions" only in the proper context.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.[CR]Perhaps the biggest surprise for players who purchased the game was that, despite the new perspective, brand new controls, and 3D graphics, Ocarina of Time was still a full-blooded Zelda game. Sticking to its roots, the game led players through nine different dungeons, having them complete tricky puzzles and defeat big bosses along the way.[CR]Ocarina of Time, like the Zelda games that came before it, is primarily an exploration and puzzle solving game, with sword combat, horseback riding, and boss fights playing providing a change of pace. The player progresses through the game by guiding Link to one of the nine dungeons and collecting a mystical artifact at the end (three jewels in the first half of the game, six medallions in the second half). Each of these dungeons is filled with puzzles that hinder Link's progress, and the player must solve them to continue their quest. In every dungeon (after the first one) players will encounter a "Sub-Boss", a powerful enemy that the player will be forced to do battle with. Defeating the Sub-Boss will lead the player to an item that will be necessary to solve puzzles farther in the dungeon. At the very end, players will encounter the Boss of the dungeon, who can only be defeated with tactical use of the new weapon retrieved in the dungeon (and some well placed sword slashes).Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3D[CR]Puzzles in the dungeons often share very basic similarities (there's quite a bit of time spent pushing blocks, standing on switches, and pushes blocks onto switches). However, each dungeon has a "theme" that changes the way the player moves through the dungeon. The Water Temple, for example, can only be beaten if the player raises and lowers the water levels, which they can only do at specific parts of the dungeon. The Shadow Dungeon, on the other hand, is filled with invisible walls and traps, not to mention mirages. The player can only see through these disguises with the Lens of Truth.[CR]Main Characters[CR]Ocarina of Time boasted a cast of dozens of characters, including both series stalwarts (like Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon) while also introducing new denizens of the land of Hyrule that would go on to be featured in later installments of the series.Link: The Hero of TimeYoung Link[CR]The main character of Ocarina of Time, and the protagonist of nearly all the Legend of Zelda games (with rare exception). Like previous Zelda games, the player may choose any name they want for the main character(including their own), but the default character name is Link. The name Link, according to Shigeru Miyamoto, comes from a literal interpretation of what the main character is in a video game: a link between the player and the game.[CR]The Link featured in Ocarina of Time is not a continuation of his adventures from the NES, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo games, but a whole new Link in a whole new story unrelated to those previous games. Ocarina of Time helped to cement the fact that the Legend of Zelda games were not a series of stories connected together in a linear timeline, but rather a retelling of the same story: different plot details, character interactions, and action sequences may occur, but the core theme(boy saves princess/world) remains the same throughout many of the main story.[CR]The player will eventually control two different "versions" of Link: first as a boy, and then later as a young adult, after he travels forward in time 7 years. This older incarnation of Link is widely regarded as the most popular representation of the series' protagonist, and fan clamor for a game starring the older, more "mature" Link was so strong that Nintendo obliged with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in 2006 for both the GameCube and Wii, which were designed around the mature Link aesthetic.[CR]Link begins Ocarina of Time as a small boy, a native of the Kokiri tribe designated as protectors of the forests of Hyrule. Link is still a child in the eyes of his peers; he's the one member of the tribe that has not been granted a fairy, a companion sprite to help him out in the world (hence his early-game nickname, "The Boy without a Fairy). At the outset of the game, Link is trouble by strange dreams, visions of a man dressed in black from the west whose presence seems to be a threat (effectively predicting the invasion of Hyrule by Ganondorf and the Gerudo Tribe).Adult Link[CR]As Link is awakened from his slumber, he meets Navi, the fairy and companion throughout the game. Link has been tasked by the Guardian of the Great Deku Tree, to remove a dark curse planted inside it by the Court Adviser and dark Wizard Ganondorf (the Gerudo man seen in Link's dreams). Despite Link's triumph over the monster deep inside the Tree's Roots, Link was too late to save the Great Deku Tree, as the curse had already taken its toll. With it's last wish, the Great Deku Tree gave Link a quest: he must leave the forest and travel across the world to Hyrule, and present a mysterious green stone, the Kokiri Emerald, to Princess Zelda, implying that she would know how to stop Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule.[CR]Link's journey will take him to the Princess Zelda, and together the two would hatch a plan to defeat Ganondorf by acquiring the Triforce, the mystical relics that helped to preserve the land and make it flourish after the goddesses created Hyrule. The Triforce was also the object of Ganondorf's desires, as the mystical triangles were able to grant any wish the holder of the relic desired. Link and Zelda decided to get to the Triforce before Ganondorf by getting to the Triforce first. To access the Sacred Realm (where the Triforce has been stored by the gods), Link must locate two more sacred stones, the Goron's Ruby and the Zora's Sapphire. Together with the Kokiri Emerald, Link and Zelda are able to open the Door of Time. When Link draws the fabled Master Sword from its pedestal from behind the door of time, he opened the Sacred Realm and access the Triforce. However, Ganon managed to get the Triforce before Link and Zelda, and with his first wish, the dark wizard declared himself the new ruler of Hyrule.[CR]When Link returns to consciousness, he finds himself inside the fabled Chamber of Sages. Inside, he is given his next task by Rauru, the Sage of Light. In order to combat Ganon and deliver Hyrule from evil, Link must awaken the other 5 sages, denizens of Hyrule that must take on the mantle of protectors of the Triforce and Hyrule. Only Link, the legendary Hero of Time (with the power to travel between the past and future) can defeat Ganondorf's evil forces. With the power of the awakened Sages, Link would be able to seal Ganondorf away inside the Sacred Realm for all time.[CR]Upon obtaining all 6 of the Sage Medallions (designators that the sage has been awakened), Link learns that Ganondorf only managed to grab one piece of the three pronged Triforce. Ganondorf possessed the Triforce of Power, while Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Courage would help give Link the strength to rescue the Princess Zelda and defeat Ganondorf once and for all.Princess Zelda / SheikPrincess Zelda (Young)[CR]The titular character of the Legend of Zelda series, Princess Zelda is a member of Hyrule's royal family. The young princess is the only member of her family that suspects Ganondorf's treachery, fearing that his true interests are to take control of the Triforce (which the Royal Family is sworn to protect).[CR]Link first meets Princess Zelda at the behest of the Great Deku Tree. His task was to take the Kokiri Emerald to the Princess. After sneaking his way into the castle and avoiding guards in the Castle Royal Gardens, Link finally makes his way into Zelda's room and private garden. At first, Zelda was surprised that the young boy had managed to sneak past the guards, but when she discovers that Link had arrived in the Castle from the forest, and had a fairy companion, Zelda remembered the dream she had of the boy emerging from the forest with a fairy, and was convinced that Link was the one destined to help her keep the Triforce away from Ganondorf. Zelda tells Link of her fears about the dark wizard, and together, the two children hatch a plan to protect the Triforce from Ganondorf's evil.Princess Zelda (Adult)[CR]To open the Door of Time and Access the Sacred Realm, the pair would need to play the Song of Time on Zelda's greatest treasure, the Ocarina of Time, passed down throughout the Royal Family.[CR]However, before Link and Zelda use the Sacred Stones to open the Door of Time, Ganondorf begins his coup in Hyrule Castle and chases the Princess and her guardian Impa from the Castle. As they cross the gate to Hyrule Castle Town, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the moat for Link to recover, imbued with a secret message from the princess that teaches Link how to play the Song of Time. The young Princess Zelda won't be seen again until the player has completed the game.[CR]When Link awakens in the Temple of Time seven years in the future, he is greeted by the mysterious Sheik, the last surviving member of the Sheikah, a tribe dedicated to the protection of the royal family. Sheik describes to Link the new world, one controlled and maintained by Ganondorf from the safety of Hyrule Castle. Sheik points Link towards the first Sage, the Sage of the Forest, and gives Link hints about the tools he will need to help save and awaken the various Sages. Sheik will eventually teach Link special "warp" songs that will instantly whisk the Hero of Time to the entrance of the five dungeons, or send him back to the Master Sword's pedestal at the Temple of Time, making the navigation of Hyrule much easier.[CR]After Link awakens all six Sages, he returns to meet Sheik at the Temple of Time. Sheik tells Link that, although Ganondorf was the ruler of Hyrule, his victory of the land was not complete. Ganondorf only possessed one piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Power. Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Wisdom, on the other hand, was bound on the hand of a mysterious "seventh sage", the leader of the other six. To Link's (and the player's) shock, Sheik removes his mask and vestments, and reveals himself to be none other than the Princess Zelda! Her disguise was a ruse to keep the Princess out of Ganondorf's clutches to protect the Triforce of Courage. As the legendary Seventh Sage, Zelda uses her power to grant Link a weapon, the mystical Arrows of Time, that could penetrate any darkness and fill it with light. However, upon revealing her true self, Ganondorf captures the Princess and brings her to Hyrule Castle. Only Link can rescue her from his clutches, so he sets off to Ganon's castle, and ascends to the top and faces the Evil King. Zelda is released upon Link's victory, but the tower starts to collapse, and the two have to escape before they're buried along with it. She helps open the gates that will lead the two to the exit and escape just as the building is destroyed. After a final battle between Link and Ganon, Zelda uses her powers to hold Ganon in place so Link can deliver the final blow to the beast. She then uses her powers in conjunction with the six sages to seal Ganon within the Sacred Realm. With Hyrule saved, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood, where he is supposed to be.Navi the Fairy"Hey!" "Listen!"[CR]Navi is one of the mysterious fairy's of the Deku Forest. We are introduced to Navi at the very start of the game when she wakes Link from his nightmare, telling Link the Deku Tree has sent her to aid Link on his journey.[CR]Navi is the secondary character that the player controls throughout the game with the new and innovative Z-Targeting mechanic. When the player presses and holds the Z-button, Navi will float over the nearest target in order to keep the players attacks directed to that object or enemy. As well as being a part of a mechanic, Navi is also one of the first characters to have voice acting. She will occasionally yell out "Watch Out" if there is something Link needs to....well, watch out for. She also says "Hey" when she has something important to tell Link, followed by a "Listen" when the player presses the Up C-button. After doing so Navi will give a hint as to what the player  should be doing next in terms of the story line, just in case they are lost.GanondorfGanondorf[CR]Ganondorf (aka Dark Lord, Great King of Evil, and Man from the West) is the main villain in Ocorina of Time as well as most of the other Zelda games. Ganondorf is from the Gerudo Tribe which is made up primarily of women except for their King and is located in the desert to the west of Hyrule. Ganondorf came to power by simply being the chosen male child to be born every hundred years. He then uses his status as King of the Gerudo to make peace with the King of Hyrule and become an adviser to the king. As a young child Princess Zelda senses something dishonest and evil about Ganondorf as he is making a truce with her father. It is through this suspicion that Princess Zelda recruits Link to help her keep Ganondorf from achieving his goal, whatever it may be. Little do they know that Ganondorf will actually use Link as a pawn to get to the Triforce.The Six SagesForestSariaSaria Main page: SariaThe sage Link saves from the Forest Temple, Saria is also a childhood friend of Link's. Unlike the other Kokiri that teased Link for lack of having a fairy, Saria spent time and often played together. When Link is told by the Great Deku Tree to leave the forest and go to Hyrule Castle, Saria gives him a Fairy Ocarina as a memento. Some moments later in the game, Link returns to the forest and finds Saria in the Sacred Forest Meadow, which is also the entrance to the Forest Temple as an adult. Here Saria teaches Link a new song for his Ocarina, that can let him communicate with Saria if he needs any advice. After becoming an adult and gaining the Hookshot, Link returns to the Sacred Forest Meadow, Saria's favorite spot, to see she isn't there. After fighting through the temple and defeating Phantom Ganon, Saria is saved and is awakened as the Sage of Forest, and gives Link the Forest Medallion.FireDaruniaDarunia Main page: DaruniaDarunia is the second sage to be awakened, and is another character Link meets in his youth. In a grouchy mood initially, Link makes him happy and dancing when he plays Saria's Song. Darunia tells Link of the Goron's predicament, their main food supply in Dodongo's Cavern being cut off by a massive boulder, and promises to give him the Spiritual Stone of Fire, Goron's Ruby, if he destroys the boulder and the monsters inhabiting Dodongo's Cavern. Link defeats the monsters and earns Darunia's respect by becoming his "Sworn Brother." They would soon meet again when the ancient dragon Volvagia was released in Death Mountain, and the two worked to free the Gorons and defeat the beast. Upon doing so, Darunia was awakened as the Sage of Fire, and grants Link the Fire Medallion.WaterRutoRuto Main page: Princess RutoPrincess of the Zoras, Sage of the Water Temple, and another childhood friend of Link. The King Zora asked of Link to find his daughter inside Lord Jabu-Jabu's belly. The reason she was inside? To find her precious gem Zora's Sapphire, the Spiritual Stone of Water. She is initially reluctant and rude towards Link, as she does not want his help. However, after saving her and defeating the monster inside Jabu-Jabu, she becomes impressed by Link's skills, and gives him the stone on the promise that he will marry her. Seven years later, Zora's Domain is frozen, and Ruto travels to the Water Temple to find out the problem. Link catches up, and Ruto had not forgotten the promise they made, though they both realize that there are other matters at hand. After navigating the temple and defeating Morpha, Ruto is awakened as the Sage of Water, presents the Water Medallion to Link.ShadowImpaImpa Main page: ImpaImpa was Zelda's handmaid, and took care of her in her youth. After Link and Zelda meet at the castle, Impa teaches him Zelda's Lullaby, which serves him many purposes, mainly to show connection with the Royal family. She is last seen in Link's youth, riding off from Hyrule Castle Town as Ganondorf is in pursuit of Zelda and the Ocarina of Time. Seven years later, Kakariko village comes under attack by the evil spirit Bongo Bongo, and Impa heads into the Shadow Temple to stop the creature. Link follows as well and defeats the creature, overcoming the illusions of the temple. Upon awakening Impa as the Sage of Shadow, Impa reassures Link that Zelda is safe, and gives him the Shadow Medallion.SpiritNabooruNabooru Main page: NabooruGanondorf's Second in Command, well originally, Nabooru finds Link as a child in the Spirit Temple, and the two decide to work towards finding out the Gerudo King's schemes, though not before Koume and Kotake capture Nabooru, Link is left to finish the job and explore the rest of the temple as an adult. The two witches had taken Nabooru and brainwashed her as an Iron Knuckle, and is forced to fight Link. Link breaks the spell over Nabooru, and Koume and Kotake, rather irritated, casts a spell on Nabooru transporting her to parts unknown. Link must then defeat the two witches in their separate and combined form Twinrova, and with their hold on the temple gone, Nabooru is freed and awakened as the Sage of Spirit, and gives Link the Spirit Medallion.LightRauruRauru Main page: RauruThe Light Sage who resides in the chamber of sages, Rauru wakes up Link from his seven year slumber after removing the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time. He takes the time to explain to Link what has happened to Hyrule in his absence, how Ganondorf was able to get his hand on the Triforce and become the King of Evil. After providing this exposition on events, he sends him back to the Temple of Time, after handing him the Light Medallion.The Seventh SageZelda's Alter-Ego, Sheik.[CR]A childhood friend of Link's are revealed to be the seventh sage. During his quest as an adult, Zelda disguised herself as Sheik and taught him new songs for his Ocarina as well as updating him on the events around Link. After returning to the Temple of Time after awakening the sages, Sheik arrives, provides more exposition on the Triforce, and reveals herself not only to have the Triforce of Wisdom, but also to be Zelda. She uses her powers to grant Link the Light Arrows, the only weapon to destroy Ganondorf, and along with the other sages seals the Evil King in the Sacred Realm.[CR]Songs[CR]Link can play a variety of songs on his ocarina. Some can be used to warp to specific locations, others have an effect on NPCs. Here's a run down of the most notable ones:[CR] Whenever Link needs to show his connection to the royal family, he plays this song. Initially to open Darunia's chamber, but subsequently whenever he sees a Triforce sign.[CR] Lets Link talk to Saria whenever he likes. She'll give advice on what to do next, much like Navi. Perhaps more importantly, it can be played to Darunia to cheer him up.[CR] Summons Epona; instrumental in the quest to obtain her as an adult, but rather useless as Young Link. It also entices the cows to give Link milk if he has a free bottle.[CR] Turns Night to Day and Day into Night. Playing the song in a area where time doesn't pass in real time will return Link to the most recent exit.[CR] Opens the Door of Time and also moves "Time Blocks" in general.[CR] It makes rain start and thunder sound in the background. Can be used to make beans sprout into a transportation vine, often leading to hidden and otherwise unreachable areas.[CR]Key Equipment[CR]Kokiri Knife - The primary sword used by Young Link, as when he claims the Master Sword he transitions into Adult Link. The weakest of all of the swords with the smallest range.Master Sword - The main sword of the game. The second strongest sword. Can be used by Adult Link only. When placed back in the Temple of Time, the player resumes as Young Link.Giant's Knife - Two-handed, breaks easily.Biggoron's Sword - Two-handed, does not break. Requires completing a long task with many steps before it can be acquired.Deku Shield - The first shield in the game. This is an item that cannot be used by adult Link. This is the primary shield for Young Link as it is the only shield that he can use to actually protect himself. The flaw with this shield is that it burns up if it comes into contact with any fire.Hylian Shield - The Hylian Shield is the main shield throughout the game. It can be used for all the same things as the Deku Shield with the added benefit of being able to block fire attacks. Young Link can actually equip this shield, however it is too heavy for him to lift. When holding the trigger to block as Young Link with the Hylian Shield equipped Link simply crouches, protecting his back from damage. The only difference between this shield and the mirror shield is that it cannot reflect light.Mirror Shield - The Mirror Shield is the third shield in the game. It is found in the Spirit Temple. The mirror shield has a shiny surface and is used to be a surface to bounce light off of. This is important for completing the Spirit Temple and beating the Spirit Temple boss, Twinrova.Kokiri Tunic - Standard green tunic. Link begins the game wearing it.Goron Tunic - Protects against heat. Red in color.Zora Tunic - Lets Link breathe under water. Blue in color.Iron Boots - The Iron Boots are found in the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon right before entering the Water Temple. These boots are equipment modifiers like the Hover Boots and the Tunics in the game. When equipped the boots slow down Link and make him take very heavy steps. This is used to have link sink to the bottom of water so he can walk on the surface. This is necessary for completing the Water Temple.Hover Boots - The Hover Boots are procured in the Shadow Temple and act as one of the equipment modifiers in the game as opposed to a C-Button item. When these are equipped Links steps become slippery as if he were running on ice. The benefit is that Link can run between two platforms and float a small distance between them which is good for gaining some distance.Ocarina of Time - The Ocarina of Time is the second Ocarina that Link gets in the game. The first one is the Fairy Ocarina. The Ocarina of Time can be played to warp the the entrance areas of every Temple in the game.Deku Stick - These fragile sticks are a consumable weapon much like bombs. They are dropped from Deku Babas. The sticks have a long range and one of the highest damage modifiers in the game. They can also be lit and used to light sconces and torches, which is used to solve puzzles.Fairy Slingshot - The Fairy Slingshot is the first dungeon item found in the game. It is found inside the tree dungeon as Young Link. This acts as Young Link's primary ranged weapon as the Fairy Bow acts the same way for adult Link.Fairy Bow - The Fairy Bow is the first dungeon item found as adult Link. The Fairy Bow is found in the Forest Temple. The Fairy Bow is needed to beat Phantom Ganon and is very helpful in handling final Ganon at the end of the game. It is often used for puzzles throughout the game. There are three elemental modifiers which can be added to the arrows. The Fire Arrows are good for lighting torches on fire. The Ice Arrow is good for freezing enemies. And the Light Arrow is strong against evil.Hookshot / Longshot - The Hookshot is needed to enter the Forest Temple as Link. This makes it one of the first necessary items to procure as adult Link. The Hookshot can be received after racing Dampe in the Kakariko graveyard. The Longshot is an upgrade for the Hookshot and acts as the dungeon weapon for the Water Temple. The Longshot is needed to reach the final boss room of the Water Temple. The Longshot is also needed for beating the Water Temple boss, MorphaMegaton Hammer - The Megaton Hammer is found in the Fire Temple as Link. Using the C-Button that the hammer is attached to can cause the hammer to be swung horizontally to knock barriers out of the way, or hammered vertically downward to crush things. The Megaton Hammer is crucial for beating the boss of the Fire Temple, Volvagia. The Megaton Hammer is also the best way to defeat the Shadow Link mini-boss in the Water Temple. Since Shadow Link copies all sword attacks that regular Link uses switching to the Megaton Hammer confuses Shadow Link.Lens of Truth - The Lens of Truth is one of the dungeon items in Ocarina of Time. The Lens of Truth is found in the first half of the Shadow Temple when Young Link goes into the Bottom of the Well mini-dungeon. Much like the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon before the Water Temple the player receives a key item needed for Link to complete the following dungeon. The Lens of Truth is used to spot fake walls and other hidden things which Link can walk through or on. The Lens of Truth is crucial for Adult Link to navigate the Shadow Temple. It is also used to fight the Shadow Temple's boss, Bongo Bongo.Bottles - There are four bottles to be obtained throughout Ocarina of Time. Bottles can be used to store potions, milk, fairies, or Poe ghosts. To use items like the Poe ghosts or fairies there is no need to equip the bottle. Fairies will automatically resurrect Link with full health when he dies, and the Poe ghosts can be cashed in by simply talking to the vendor.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time received universal critical acclaim and had a huge commercial success. It was the best selling game of 1998, with up to 2.5 million sales, even though it was released only 39 days before the end of the year. The game was praised for the intuitive controls, depth, and wonderful story. The games received Perfect 10 scores from numerous websites and magazines and won many Game Of The Year Awards. Ocarina of Time has often been called the greatest game of all time and to this day remains a classic.[CR]Nintendo 3DS Remake[CR]It was announced at E3 2010 that Ocarina of Time would be getting it's first real remake on Nintendo 3DS with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. The graphics, aside from being presented in full stereoscopic 3D and in 30 frames-per-second, have been greatly improved with redrawn textures and completely redone character models. Significant updates to the gameplay like being able to switch the Iron Boots on and off from the touch screen were also included. The game includes a mirrored version of version of Ocarina of Time: Master Quest, the harder alternate version of the game with re-arranged dungeon puzzles and other smaller changes.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]1."Title Theme"1:202."Enter Ganondorf"0:133."Deku Tree"0:364."Fairy Flying"0:235."House"0:366."Kokiri Forest"1:017."Open Treasure Box"0:108."Item Catch"0:049."Small Item Catch"0:0510."Shop"1:0811."Battle"1:0712."Inside the Deku Tree"1:2713."Boss Battle"1:1914."Boss Clear"0:1315."Heart Container Get"0:0516."Legend of Hyrule"1:5817."Spiritual Stone Get"0:1618."Fairy Ocarina Get"0:1119."Hyrule Field Main Theme"4:4320."Kepora Gebora's Theme"1:0021."Market"0:5922."Shooting Gallery"0:3923."Hyrule Castle Courtyard"0:5324."Enter Zelda"0:0625."Ocarina "Zelda's Lullaby""0:1226."Zelda's Theme"0:4927."Ocarina "Epona's Song""0:0928."LonLon Ranch"2:0829."Mini Game"0:3230."Kakariko Village"1:4431."Ocarina "Sun's Song""0:0732."Hyrule Field Morning Theme"0:3733."Goron City"1:3834."Ocarina "Saria's Song""0:0935."Lost Woods"0:3936."Dodongo's Cavern"0:4637."Middle Boss Battle"1:0738."Dinosaur Boss Battle"1:0839."Zora's Domain"1:3040."Great Fairy's Fountain"0:3541."Potion Shop"0:5242."Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly"0:3443."Ocarina "Song of Time""0:1244."Temple of Time"1:1945."Open Door of Temple of Time"0:1546."Master Sword"0:1347."Ganondorf's Theme"0:4148."Chamber of the Sages"1:4349."Medal Get Fanfare"0:1450."Sheik's Theme"0:3051."Horse Race"0:4652."Horse Race Goal"0:0553."Ingo's Theme"0:3954."Escape from LonLon Ranch"0:0955."Kakariko Village Orchestra Ver."1:4456."Ocarina "Song of Storms""0:0757."Windmill Hut"0:5258."Minuet of Woods"0:1759."Forest Temple"1:5260."Bolero of Fire"0:2061."Fire Temple"0:4262."Ice Cavern"0:4563."Serenade of Water"0:1964."Water Temple"1:4465."Nocturne of Shadow"0:2366."Prelude of Light"0:1867."Shadow Temple"1:4568."Gerudo Valley"1:3469."Spirit Temple"2:5770."Requiem of Spirit"0:2471."Kotake &amp; Koume's Theme"0:5272."Meet Again Zelda"0:5173."Game Over"0:0974."Ganon's Castle Bridge"0:2275."Ganon's Castle Under Ground"0:5376."Inside Ganon's Castle"3:2677."Ganondorf's Battle"1:1278."Escape from Ganon's Castle"0:3379."Last Battle"2:1080."Seal of Six Sages"0:2981."Ocarina of Time"0:3282."End Credits"7:10[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]Upon release, Lego Racers was noted for its creation tools which allowed the player to create their own vehicle and driver. At the time the concept was regarded as innovative, and is one which has transcended through many other genres and is a staple in many new releases today. The player could then take their custom vehicle and driver for use in the game's adventure mode. The adventure mode consisted of numerous different worlds, each inhibiting their own end of series boss aswell as track. Upon defeat of the boss, their lego head, torso and legs, aswell as vehicle were them available to the player for use in the creation modes. The game reaches a climax as the player must defeat "Rocket Racer" the fastest racer in the lego universe, in order to claim the final trophy and title the ultimate lego racer  [CR]Customization[CR]Lego Racers offers much in the way of customization. The player's car can be customized, using the Lego builder,  by adding Lego Bricks and various accessories onto a variety of unchangable pre-built chassis. Characters can also be customized in a way that , for the time, was quite revolutionary and innovative. The player can customize his/her character by changing headwear, heads, torsos, and legs.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Go to the ''Build'' menu. Then select ''New Driver'' from the Build Driver screen. Enter the following code at the ''Make License'' screen. Once you have entered the code remember to press down instead of a button. The code will be active as long as the driver with that name is still in the line-up of available racers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip the last lap of a race[CR]In 2 player mode, you do not need to complete the final lap of a race in order to win. When you pass the finish line to start the last lap of the race, simply turn around and re-cross the line. You will win the race without doing the final lap.</plot>

Battle the enemy in the air and on the ground and listen in as Fox McCloud interacts with a cast of characters.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Title Screen Trick[CR]On the Title Screen, press the B button for one time, then start rotating your analog joystick around until the number 64 on the end of the logo starts to move. Move it anywhere on the screen. You realise that the characters will follow it with their heads. Try letting go of the stick and it will return back to its initial position.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] A never ending versus match.[CR]Normally a game will end when one player reaches the ammount of points he is supposed to get. However, if you have a game of 3-4 players, and your person has 2 kills(you have to get 3 to win), if that person kills two people at once, it skips the 3 and goes to 4, thus messing up the counter, and the game will never end untill you reset the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Artwork[CR]You can view two different pieces of artwork for beating Venom on expert mode. The artwork you see depends whether you beat Venom on the easy path or hard.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Disable the Crosshair[CR]When the game is paused, press the R trigger to turn off the crosshairs.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Story Overview[CR] For centuries an impenetrable darkness has shrouded Europe and North Africa, with countless victims succumbing to the ravenous hunger of unchecked pestilence and war. Once a promising glimpse of humanity&#8217;s potential, the cradle of civilization has become a well of despair.   Many great kingdoms have been devastated, but a select few have grown more powerful. These comprise of the covenant of seven &#8211; lords who have allied with Asmodeus, a practitioner of the dark arts who wields the fabled Mace of Tanis. The Mace is imbued with necropotic energy, offering those who wield it a tantalizing promise of ever-lasting life and unbridled power.   With this power comes a terrible price: Asmodeus must feed off despair, disease, and poverty. In limited doses, Asmodeus grants the Seven the power they need and crave. In return, they expand their kingdoms with bloody battles and torment their peasants. But can no longer sustain Asmodeus&#8217; ravenous appetite. He now reaches east into the orient, to find new lords who yearn to sample the dark powers.   But there is a rebellion. Each of the Seven, addicted to the corrupting power of the Mace, dispatch their best warriors to kill Asmodeus and steal his power. Leaders from the east sense Asmodeus&#8217; plottings and strive to destroy him before it&#8217;s too late.   Heirs to kingdoms long since vanquished, seek revenge on Asmodeus and those who wield the dark energy. They are the fiercest fighters on Earth, and they all have one thing in common.

		<title_clean>Major League Baseball featuring Ken Griffey Jr.</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Major League Baseball is one of the few games Nintendo has published that was a affiliated with an official sports league. Nintendo is the owner of the Seattle Mariners, and Griffey Jr. was playing for them at the time of release. Nintendo used their authority as owners of the Mariners and featured Griffey Jr. in their game. The game featured all the teams, players, and parks that were part of MLB at the time of release. Griffey also supplied his voice for spoken commentary in the game.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]This is Griffey's hitting cursor in Major League Baseball      Major League Baseball featured robust features for a arcade style baseball game. There is a Exhibition, Season Mode, and Home Run Derby, and these modes act as they would in most baseball games. Every single player in the game had their stats used in the game, and they usually played according to their stats. In order to hit the ball you were given a cursur to line up with the ball and hit, and the players stats decided how big their cursor would be. Griffey Jr. for example had a large cursor considering his offensive stats at the time of release. Major League Baseball was a very simple and accessible game because of its arcade style set up. Games would often be high scoring because of it's arcade nature. You could make batting more difficult by removing your cursor or you could set the defense to manual allowing you to control defensive portions of the game. These changes could make the game considerably more difficult. Major League Baseball also featured multiplayer for players to compete in various modes. All of the game modes except for the Season Mode could be used for multiplayer. The game also had an interesting feature that would allow you to tour the stadiums in the league at the time. To tour the stadium you could use the analogue stick on N64 controller to move about the park.   Additionally the game featured various button command cheats, including one specifically that would allow Ken Griffey Jr to raise his bat towards the center field bleachers, essentially calling his shot. On the very next pitch, if the player made contact with the ball Griffey Jr would hit a homerun, no matter the location of the pitch. The command to perform the called shot is:  Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Left, Left on the C-Buttons.   There are also two unlockable teams after the player wins the World Series in Season Mode. Players can go all 162 games, or if they choose they can pick "Pennant Race" as season duration and only play roughly 25 games, depending on a teams schedule. The unlockable teams were "Angel Studios", the developer, and "Nintendo", the games publisher. The names used for each teams were developers who worked on the game. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Uniform Color[CR]Select exhibition mode, then at the team selection screen, repeatedly tap C-Left + C-Right + C-Up + C-Down[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Homerun Denial[CR]To do this, the ball needs to be hit very high, to the point where you see the huge shadow on the field. When you see the huge shadow, run all the way back to the wall and get in alignment with the shadow. Now instead of jumping and trying to rob the homerun just stand there, and when you do this, your player should warp through the wall and catch the ball for an out. And if it's not a homerun, the ball will bounce off the wall right into your hands.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's title screen.[CR]Mario Kart 64 is a Mario themed go-kart racing game developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64, released in 1996. It is the sequel to Super Mario Kart for the SNES and features characters and track locations from the Mario universe. Mario Kart 64 made the leap from Mode 7 to full 3D computer graphics, which allowed for complex track designs. The characters, however, remain 2-dimensional sprites. The game was a huge success, selling millions of copies and eventually became a Player's Choice title.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bowser in Mario Kart 64[CR]At its most bare-bones, Mario Kart 64 only requires the player to press the accelerate button to drive and use the analog control stick to control the kart's direction. More experienced players will be able to use drifting and Mario themed weapons and items such as Turtle Shells and Mushroom Boosts to get the advantage over their opponents. Items are scattered in rainbow colored boxes across each track and as the items in each box are random and potentially very powerful, they add a certain level of uncertainty to each race. The drifting mechanic is performed by hopping and turning in mid air which allows a player to take sharp turns without losing speed, and if done correctly one can obtain a speed boost.[CR]The game is separated into four play types, Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial. In each of these modes the player chooses from 16 race tracks and 8 playable racers, each of which have different attributes such as speed, acceleration, and weight. These attributes affect how each character handles. The Grand Prix mode has four difficulties, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Extra, each progressively faster with more difficult opponents, or in the case of Extra, mirrored versions of all of the tracks. The 16 tracks are divided into 4 cups, and the player is tasked with racing these cups to win trophies. If they achieve all gold trophies in all the cups in each difficulty, they are rewarded with a new title screen. Versus and Battle mode allow players to compete with up to four of their friends via split screen. Versus allows friends to race together on any of the single player tracks, and battle allow players to fight in large arenas using items. Time Trial has a player racing against the clock. This mode will display a " ghost" of the best time, which is a translucent recording of the previous best lap.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The playable characters are:LightweightPlayer select screenToadPrincess PeachYoshiMiddleweightMarioLuigiHeavyweightDonkey KongWarioBowser[CR]Lightweight racers have quick acceleration and excellent handling, but have slow top speeds and are easily knocked around. Middleweight racers are good all around racers with middle of the road attributes. Heavyweight racers have high top speeds and are very difficult to bully, but have slow acceleration and can be difficult to handle.[CR]An early version of the game featured the character Magikoopa instead of Donkey Kong.[CR]Tracks[CR]The 16 tracks in Mario Kart 64 are:Mushroom CupSherbet LandLuigi Raceway - A simple course that slightly resembles a Nascar track.Moo Moo Farm - A bumpy dirt course that circles a farm pasture. Watch out for jumping Monty Moles.Koopa Troopa Beach - A sandy beach island course. A rocky interior is to one side and the ocean to the other.Kalimari Desert - This course is a desert course that weaves across train tracks. Make sure to stop for trains.Flower CupToad's Turnpike - A simple freeway made difficult by oncoming traffic. Avoid getting hit at all cost.Frappe Snowland - A snowscape littered with explosive snowmen and thick snow dunes.Choco Mountain - Race along chocolate cliff overhangs and dodge falling boulders.Mario Raceway - A twisty thin track with piranha plants and a huge green pipe tunnel.Star CupWario Stadium - Resembles a dirt bike race course. Many great jumps and full of shortcuts.Sherbet Land - An ice course around a freezing lake. Avoid the sledding penguins big and small.Royal Raceway - Windy and thin asphalt course. Watch for the hidden Mario 64 castle.Bowsers Castle - Filled with menacing traps and hazards.Special CupDK's Jungle Parkway - A Jungle course with a large jump across a river. Watch out for the ferry.Yoshi Valley - A thin twisting multi-path course. It has many bottomless pits.Banshee Boardwalk - A rickety wooden course with ghosts and a haunted house full of bats.Rainbow Road - A long course in space made of rainbows.[CR]Soundtracks[CR]Mario Kart 64 Race Tracks[CR]The soundtracks to Mario Kart 64 were composed by Kenta Nagata.Mario Kart 64 Greatest Hits Soundtrack[CR]Released: March 1st, 1997[CR]Total length: 31:44Mario Kart 64 ThemeCircuit SelectMoo Moo FarmKoopa Troopa BeachFrappe SnowlandKoopa CastleKalimari DesertRainbow RoadDK's Jungle ParkwayToad's TurnpikeBattle 1Results ThemeTrophy PresentationVictory Lap[CR]Mario Kart 64 Tracks[CR]Mario Kart 64 Theme3 Raceways/Wario StadiumMoo Moo Farm/Yoshi ValleyKoopa Troopa BeachKalimari DesertToad's TurnpikeFrappe Snowland/Sherbet LandChoco Mountain/Battle ArenasKoopa CastleDK's Jungle ParkBanshee BoardwalkRainbow RoadStar PowerSetup and Kart SelectBattle ArenasWinning ResultsLosing ResultsTime Trial ResultsTrophy PresentationsNo Trophy for You!Victory LapBonus TracksStart Your EnginesFinish TrialFinal LapFinish FirstFinish OKFinish OutFinish LastVoice Collection[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Mario Kart 64 initially received relatively positive reviews.

It sold 5.5 million copies in the US and 2.24 million in Japan.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra in Mario GP[CR]Get the gold trophy in the Special Cup 150cc in Mario GP. You will see the credits roll. After that you will be able to access "Extra" mode in Mario GP, which allows you to play the courses as if they were mirrored.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Ending[CR]To get a hidden ending in Mario Kart 64, place 4th place overall. This is a lot harder than it sounds because if you place 5th or lower in any one race, you must restart. The easiest way to place 4th overall is just to get 4th place in every race. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Booster[CR]To get a boost at the start of the race and an early lead, do not hold the acceleration button before the race.  Wait until after the last light flashes, then punch the gas.  If you time it just right, you should get a boost that puts you into first place!</plot>

		<title_clean>Mario Party</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Party is the first game in Nintendo's popular Mario Party franchise. Mario Party was released on February 8, 1999 in North America, December 14, 1998 in Japan, and March 9, 1999 in Europe and Australia. Mario Party was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. The release of Mario Party for the Nintendo 64 marked the beginning of Nintendo's long-running Mario Party franchise (which now contains eleven games total). Mario Party received generally positive reviews, currently holding a 77% average rating on Game Rankings and a 79% average rating on Metacritic. The game was criticized for not having an entertaining single-player, but was praised for its strong multiplayer elements.[CR]The game's story involves a group of Nintendo characters ( Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong) arguing over who is the best. Each character brings up their strong aspect, saying that the one who is the best should have that aspect. Toad then suggests that they all take a journey to Mushroom Village, and during their adventures discover who is the best. The group then departs for Mushroom Village, to see who is the best of them all.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mushroom Village, the "menu screen" of the game.[CR]Mario Party establishes many of the gameplay aspects that have become standard in the Mario Party franchise. The player (or players in multiplayer) are placed on one of many "boards" (essentially stages or levels). These boards are separated by spaces (like a regular game board). The goal of the game is to collect the most stars. Only one star is on the board at one time, and it can be purchased for the price of 20 coins. The one other way to get stars is to steal them by using a Boo, who will steal another player's star for the price of 50 coins.[CR]Coins can be collected by landing on blue spaces on the game board or by winning minigames. Coins can then be used to purchase items and stars. In addition, if the game is a tie, then the player with the most coins will win. Coins can be lost as well; if the player lands on a red space, a Bowser space, or loses a certain minigame (not all minigames cause the loser to lose coins).[CR]At the end of a game, three bonus stars are granted to the players. One star goes to the person who had the most coins during the game (not total, at one point), one goes to the person who got the most coins during minigames, and one star goes to the person who landed on the most question mark spaces. If there is a tie for these awards, then the player who has the most coins will be awarded the star.[CR]Minigames are what Mario Party was most praised for. Mario Party has 56 minigames in all of four different types. These types are four player minigames (a free-for-all minigame), two versus two (where two players are on a team versus another team), one versus three (where one player with a large advantage competes against the other three), or one player minigames (they only occur when the player lands on a one-player minigame space, and give the player the opportunity to either gain or lose coins.[CR]A couple of the games minigames involve turning the analong stick in a circular motion as fast as possible. Players quickly relaized that the best strategy to winning was to place their palm flat on the analog stick and spin. This had an unfortunate side effect of the analog sick cutting into the players skin causing noticeable blisters. Nintendo, fearing a lawsuit, eventually offered free latex gloves to anyone who was hurt in this way. Subsequently, follow up games in the series replace this action with alternating between two face buttons rapidly.Boards (Stages)[CR]Artwork of Mario's Rainbow Castle.Mario's Rainbow Castle: A linear board where the path ends at the main tower, there the player will meet either Toad or Bowser. They switch places everytime someone meets them or land on a "?"-space.Luigi's Engine Room: Walk around a giant engine room, paths are limited by blue and red doors that close/opens each turn or by landing on a "?"-space. You can also pay a robot to change them.Eternal Star: The final board that the player need to collect 100 stars in total to enter. You need to buy the stars from Baby Bowser instead of Toad on this board, but only if you roll a bigger dice than him.DK's Jungle Adventure: A jungle board that features path blocking Whomps, Indiana Jones boulder and the only board with two Boos to visit. "?"-space will trigger the boulder and chase all players in it's path.Yoshi's Tropical Island: Two tropical islands connected by bridges, Toad is on the right island, Bowser on the left. However these two swap places every time a "?"-space is landed on.Wario's Battle Island: On this board player will meet Bom-ombs that force them into a cannon and blast them to the next section of the board. Cannons directions is reversed if a "?"-space is landed on.Peach's Birthday Cake: This board have most "?"-spaces in the game. If player lands on one, they can pay 30 coins for a star stealing Pirhana plant, then if a opponent land on that space his/her star is stolen and given to you, then the plant disappear. In addtion to that: The player must "lose" a lottery in order to see Toad, while the "winner" will meet Bowser.Bowser's Magma Mountain: Bowser's board, players should avoid Bowser at all cost on this board as he might steal a star from you. "?"-space will make all blue spaces red for the next 3 turns. This board can bepurchased in the shop when the other boards have been played.SPACESBLUE SPACE: Player gets 3 coins. The player panel will become blue.RED SPACE: Player loses 3 coins. The player panel will become red."?"-SPACE: Will make something happen on the board you're playing on. The player panel will become green."!"-SPACE: This will send the player to Chance-time, you hit three rotating block that will determine what will happen, results can be like anything like giving a oppenent 30 coins or getting a star from him. Player panel will become blue.BOWSER SPACE: Player will trigger a Bowser event and nobody's coins is safe when that happens. However you are able to gain coins if the event is "Bowser revolution". If the player lands on this space with 0 coins however, Bowser will actually give you coins, leaving a confused player character. The player panel will become red.STAR-SPACE: This will let the player play "1-player mini-game" to earn some extra coins, losing it however will result in losing 5 coins instead. The player panel will become blue.MUSHROOM-SPACE: Will make the player hit a special dice with two outcomes, either you roll a extra dice the current turn or you have to skip your next one. The player panel will become blue.[CR]Mini-Game Island[CR]From Mushroom village it is possible to go to the Mini-game island. At the beginning you choose a your character and ally character. (For 2 vs 2 games, you'll never face this character as a opponent) You're then presented with a map screen (Mario World style) and it's your objective to make it from the start to the goal and recieve a secret price. The stages is actually the mini-games from the game and you need to win them or beat their condition to pass them and be allowed to move on. The coins you earn from mini-games goes into a total and earn you a extra life each time it passes 100. Fail the mini-game and you lose a life, lose all of them and you start from where you last saved. On the map there is also some Koopa Troopa spaces where you can save and return to the village. The map path is linar but does a split and reconnects later at some point, allowing the player to chose what mini-games he wants to challenge.[CR]Mini Games[CR]4-Player Mini GamesBalloon Burst: Hit A and B (or A and Z) back and forth repeatedly in order to make a Bowser balloon inflate and, eventually, explode.

		<title_clean>Mario Party 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Party 2 is the second game in the Mario Party franchise. Mario Party 2 was released on January 24, 2000 in North America, December 17, 1999 in Japan, October 12, 2000 in Europe, and November 6, 2000 in Australia. The game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo (as with every other game in the franchise besides Mario Party-e). Mario Party 2 was generally well-received from critics, garnering an average review score of 76% from Game Rankings. The game was criticized for not differing much from its predecessor, however.[CR]The plot of the game involves Mario and his friends creating a world called "Mario Land," but then Wario wants to call the world "Wario Land." They begin arguing over the name, with other characters introducing their own names. As this is happening, Bowser decides to try and invade the world. Whoever can defeat Bowser will get the world named after them.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the game's many four player minigames.[CR]The goal of Mario Party 2 is to gather the most stars before the end of the game. To do this, players are placed on a game board (similar to that of a real life board game) in which they travel spaces each turn, gathering coins and items to the ultimate goal of a star. Coins can also be gathered by participating in minigames. The winner is presented with a set amount of coins, while the losers are rewarded with nothing.[CR]Mario Party 2 has several new features. Each character (Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong) has a costume unique to each game board. So, depending on which board the game is on, the costume for the character changes to that certain theme. For example, if the players are in Space Land, then the characters will be dressed in space-related attire.[CR]The game also adds new spaces to the game board. In addition to adding buildings (which have their own spaces on the game board), Mario Party 2 adds a Battle Space, Item Space, and Bank Space. The battle space will trigger a battle minigame, which are introduced in this game. The item space begins a minigame that allows the player to win an item. The bank space opens up the Koopa Bank, giving whoever stepped on the bank space all coins currently in the bank.[CR]The minigames are what the Mario Party franchise is most known for. In addition to introducing the battle minigames, Mario Party 2 contains four player minigames, two versus two minigames, one versus three minigames, item minigames (triggered by the item space), and duel minigames. Four player minigames pit all four players into a free-for-all, two versus two is a team game with randomly selected teams, one versus three pits one player with an advantage versus the other three, and duel minigames are minigames between two players.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]"Even when you win, you lose, Mario Party..."Jeff Gerstmann, (Mario Party Party 2)[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Mario Party 3</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's title screen with the Mario Party crew.[CR]Mario Party 3 was the final game in the popular series to be released on the Nintendo 64.It was the first in the series to feature duel maps, multiple save slots, and allowing characters to carry three items instead of one. Copies of the game have become very rare in Europe and are now sold online for very high prices. Mario Party 3 probably made the biggest additions and changes in the history of the series and because of this, hard core fans of the series are divided between those who love it dearly and those who desperately hate it. Many of the new additions made in this game did not make a return when the series shifted over to the GameCube with Mario Party 4.[CR]Battle Royal[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Battle Royal is the same mode that was used in previous Mario Party games. The objective is to move around the game board and collect as many stars as possible. The person who has the most stars by the end of the predetermined amount of turns wins. Players obtain stars at the Star Space for 20 coins. The Star Space is randomly determined and each time somebody gets a star, the Star Space moves to another location on the board. At the end of each turn, the 4 characters compete in a mini-game. The winner(s) of the mini-game receives 10 coins. To move around the board, players hit a 10-sided dice block, and the number they get determines how far they move.Spaces[CR]There are a total of 8 different spaces players can land on each board:Blue Space: The most frequent space on all of the boards. If you land on this, you will get 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and a blue status for that turn.Red Space: Landing on this will make you lose 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and give you a red status for that turn.Happening Space: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location. It will give you a green status for that turnBowser Space: The worse space to possibly land on. Bowser will bring up a roulette, each option with a horrible consequence, which includes losing stars and coins. This also gives a red status.Chance Time Space: A green space with an exclamation mark on top. This brings up a slot machine with 3 panels. The left and right panel are the playing characters while the middle one is the yield. Players can give a certain amount of coins or stars to the other player, or they could both swap coins or stars. This also gives a green status.Battle Space: All players must give up a certain amount of coins to the pot and play a mini-game. 1st place gets 70% and second place gets 30%.Item Space: One of the best spaces because there is a high reward and no risk. You either play an item mini-game to earn items or you get asked a question by Toad or Baby Bowser and they give you an item if you picked the right answer. This space gives a green status.Koopa Bank Space: Passing by this space will force you to give up 5 coins to the Koopa Bank. Landing on this space will give you all of the coins the Koopa Bank has collected. Landing here gives a green status.Game Guy Space: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost.[CR]Duel Mode[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Duel mode was a completely new addition to the Mario Party series. In duel mode there are only two combatants instead of the usual 4. The objective here is different than Battle Royal; instead of collecting stars, the mission is to remove the enemy's 5 heart pieces. To do this, you can use a partner that you pay 10 coins for, and they will move in front of you. If you walk into the enemy, they will attack him or her which will result in lost heart pieces, depending on how strong the partner is. You can also have a partner be put behind you so you can use some defense. The partner you get is determined by a roulette. Partners also have a salary that you have to pay on a turn-basis. They will disappear if you cannot pay for their services. If both combatants are still alive by the end of the predetermined amount of turns, then the character with the most heart pieces wins. If they have the same amount of heart pieces, then the character with the most coins wins. If they still somehow have the same amount of heart pieces and coins, then the winner will be determined by who rolls a higher number on 10-sided dice block.Spaces[CR]There are some new spaces exclusively for the Duel Mode and some from Battle Royal. There are also others from Battle Royal that are not present in Duel Mode. The following are the spaces in Duel Mode:Normal Space: A normal, blank space. When you land on one, your characters face will mark it. If you land on the same space again, you will earn 5 coins. If enemy lands on it, you will receive 5 coins from them. You can also land it your enemy's space(s).Mini-Game Space: When this space is landed on, a mini-game begins and the winner receives 5 coins.Power-Up Space: When somebody lands on a Power-Up Space, his or her characters' stats will go up, however, so will their salary.Reverse Space: If landed on, you are forced to roll again and move in the opposite direction.Happening Space: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location.Game Guy Space: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost.[CR]Story Mode[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]In story mode, the objective is to collect 7 star-stamps. In order to do this, you must win in Battle Royal and Duel Mode games. For each stamp you must first one a Battle Royal and then win a Duel Mode game. However, for the seventh stamp, you must beat a boss. After doing so, you beat the Story Mode. By beating it, the face of the character that you beat it with will be engraved into Mt. Mariomore, a play on the American monument, Mt. Rushmore. You will also unlock a hidden mini-game and unlock super hard difficulty if you beat Story Mode on hard.[CR]Mini-Games[CR]4 Player Mini-Games:[CR]This mini-game will take place after the turn is over if all of the characters have a blue status* or if all have a red status*.

		<title_clean>Mega Man 64</title_clean>
		<plot>Description[CR]Mega Man blasts his way onto the Nintendo&#174; 64 System for the first time ever! This epic adventure combines the best of classic Mega Man action with enormous bosses, a riveting storyline and all the depth of the hottest RPG. Explore vast 3-D worlds in your quest to find the treasure of all treasures, the Mother Lode. You'll love the stunning 3-D graphics, powerful weapons and non-stop action ...unless of course, you're a boos.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Setting and characters[CR]The Legends series take place on a flooded Earth. Because of the flooding, only a few sparse islands exist and energy sources are rare. In order to satisfy this increasing demand for energy to power up machinery, quantum refractors found in ancient ruins are used. These refractors are valuable, they serve as an energy source, and their shards are used as currency. However, the main goal of every person is to find the Mother Lode, an item of supposed infinite power that can fill the need for the energy in one swoop. Those who try to excavate these ruins are called "Diggers" ("Digouters" in the Japanese version). The protagonist of the game is Mega Man Volnutt, a Digger living in a ship called Flutter. He lives there alongside Roll Caskett, his Spotter who is searching for her missing father, Barrel Caskett, Roll's grandfather, and Data, a mysterious monkey that talks in gibberish only Mega Man himself can understand. The game's antagonists are pirates known as the Bonnes who want to steal Kattelox's secret treasure in order to become rich. They consist of Teisel Bonne, the leader of the group.[11] His sibling are Tron Bonne, who builds most of their robots used in their elaborate schemes (and develops feelings for Mega Man), and the youngest brother, Bon Bonne, who can only say one word&#151;"Babu!" The Bonnes are accompanied by forty Servbots, robots under the care of Tron.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game begins with MegaMan Volnutt trying to exit a ruin after finding the refractor inside. After dealing with the Reaverbots blocking his way out, he makes his way to the Flutter, which leaves the ruin. However, the Flutter experiences some engine problems and crash lands on Kattelox Island. From there, the Caskett try to find a way to repair their ship. However, when the pirates the Bonnes attack Kattelox's city with giant mechanicals, Mega Man decides to stop them. Once Mega Man is able to defeat each member individually, Kattelox's mayor, Amelia, tells Mega Man the Bonnes are searching for the island's secret treasure and that it is said if somebody obtains it, a disaster will happen in the island. Amelia asks Mega Man to explore the island's ruins in order to investigate it. With a refractor found in a ruin, Roll and Mega Man are able to repair the Flutter, allowing them to find a cave to continue exploring the island. While exploring the cave, Mega Man activates the Main Gate, a dungeon where he should be able to find the reason why Reaverbots from the island are being activated. Before being able to enter into the Main Gate, Mega Man once again confronts the Bonnes who after being defeated once again, decide to let Mega Man enter the Main Gate and then take their chance to steal the treasure.[CR]When Mega Man enters the Main Gate, he discovers it is actually a stasis chamber for the robot Mega Man Juno, a 3rd class bureaucratic unit from Eden, a space station orbiting above the planet. When he is accidentally awakened from his sleep by Mega Man, Juno makes many strange revelations, among them referring to Mega Man as "Mega Man Trigger", and realizing that Mega Man is suffering from memory loss. Juno claims that the island's population needs to be purged so it will be more controllable confronts Mega Man when he tries to stop him. After a struggle, Juno is defeated and dies. Even with Juno's physical body gone, he transfers his backup data into the systems of Eden, and the Carbon Purification Process was still continuing its preparations. Data gives new commands to the system, stopping the Purification and also deleting Juno's backup data from Eden. Data then reveals to Mega Man that he contains all of his previous memories, when he was Mega Man Trigger. Mega Man had stored his memories into Data as a way to prevent Eden from ever tampering with it. Data promises that he will restore Mega Man's memory when the time comes. The residents proclaim Mega Man a hero and the Caskett family rides the repaired Flutter to continue their journey.[CR][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mega Man Legends differs greatly from the platforming gameplay of past Mega Man games, the main factor being the three-dimensional worlds, and three-dimensional movement therein. Unlike the original Mega Man series which are platform games, Legends is an action roleplaying game. The player controls Mega Man Volnutt across the title, in which he has to complete different missions such as investigating ruins or fighting pirates. The player travels through a large world, with various dungeons that are explored in a certain order, as well as a town with non-player characters to talk to. As such, the plot is revealed through cutscenes.[CR]An early boss battle in which Mega Man battles robots controlled by pirates.[CR]Although the only way to move on the game is by walking, once Roll Caskett repairs support car, she is able to directly take Mega Man to specific areas. In Legends, large gems called Refractors are used as a power source. Small shards of them can be exchanged for money, and in the game, enemies that are destroyed will often drop these Refractor Shards. When shards are picked up, the equivalent amount of Zenny, the game's basic unit of currency, is added automatically. The health of Mega Man can be increased through the game in the shops, while it can be recovered through packs bought at shops, obtaining red spheres from defeated opponents or by asking the character Data to recover Mega Man's health. Mega Man also has a Life Shield which reduces the damage that he can receive from enemies. The damage caused by enemies can also be reduced by obtaining upgrades to Mega Man's armor or his helmet. Mega Man's interactions with characters from the game can also affect the price of objects. If the player makes Mega Man be rude with characters, prices from objects will be increased and the dialogues with people will also change.[CR]The power of Mega Man's main weapon - the Buster Gun - depends on Buster Parts equipped. Buster Parts can be equipped to upgrade four stats of the Buster Gun; Attack (how strong it is), Rapid (how fast it fires), Range (how far the shots go), and Energy (how many shots can be fired before stopping). Buster Parts can be retrieved from stores or from dungeons. Additionally, Roll is able to create Buster Parts from unusable objects found in the ruins. Roll is also able to make weapons for the player, using specific combinations of parts that can be found in dungeons or bought in shops. Many of these weapons supplement the Buster Gun. The only way to refill them in the field is an item that can be bought, but only one can be carried. Only one special weapon can be equipped at a time, and the only way to switch is to talk to Roll, unlike the original series. Special weapons can be upgraded, and have five stats; Attack, Rapid, Range, Energy, and Special. In order to upgrade them, the player must pay a specific amount of Zenny.[CR][CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]    * MegaMan Volnutt (???&#183;??????, Rock Volnutt in the original version?) is the main character of the series. He is found sealed within a crystal along with Data during an excavation of Nino Island by Barrell Caskett, who brings him in and raises him. He is named after Roll's favorite video game character and soon grows up to be a Digger, searching for adventure, providing for his makeshift family, and protecting them all from the Bonnes and other dangers. It is eventually revealed that he was once as a First Class Purifier Unit named Mega Man Trigger charged with the protection of Elysium. After being told to destroy the Master System by the Master, he battled and defeated Sera. However his damage was so extensive that he was forced to have his memory removed and placed within Data and was reset to the default configuration of a newborn baby. He was then sealed within the crystal by Yuna. Volnutt also appears as a playable character in Namco X Capcom and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars.[CR]    * Roll Casket is Mega Man's friend and Digging partner. She often aids MegaMan as a Spotter during his dungeon adventures by keeping in radio contact and warning him of dangers and hidden caches. She also makes weapons for him and transports him around the city using the Caskets' van that she fixed. Her parents (Barrell's daughter and her husband) were diggers who mysteriously disappeared on a dig of Forbidden Island. She appears in Namco X Capcom as MegaMan's partner character.[CR]    * Professor Barrell Caskett is Roll's grandfather, and MegaMan's adoptive grandfather. Barrell is a famous Digger and the author of various books on the subject. He discovers MegaMan while on Nino Island without permission, and takes in Roll after her parents disappear.[CR]    * Data is a small robot monkey found with MegaMan. He accompanies Roll as a pet, and he can communicate with MegaMan, though others eventually learn to understand him. He holds all of MegaMan's memories, and MegaMan is the only person able to retrieve them.[CR]    * The Bonne Family are the leaders of the Servbots, who often create difficulties for Mega Man and Roll as they continue on their adventures. Tron Bonne is the genius of the trio, and the creator of the Servbots and various fighting machines. She harbors a crush on MegaMan. Bon Bonne is essentially a baby, encased in a large, mechanical fighting suit and he is only able to say "Babu." Teisel Bonne is the tactician of the group, though most of his plans are very extravagant. Tron Bonne is a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and Namco X Capcom with Servbots as a partner character; she has also starred in her own spinoff game, The Misadventures of Tron Bonne.[CR]    * Servbots (???, Kobun?) are a group of forty-one small, indestructible robots created by Tron Bonne to do her bidding. Each Servbot has an ability from cooking to cleaning to battle, and they do various chores on board the Bonne family airship, the Gesellschaft. They behave like children and love and adore Tron like a mother, however strict she may be with them. Somehow, they look like a trademark of Lego characters. Despite their small size, they can be quite powerful fighters and are vital to the Bonnes' success as pirates. Servbots accompany Tron in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes and Namco x Capcom during several of her special moves, and one is also a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes. They also cameo in Dead Rising as a toy helmet that can be worn or placed on zombies (which is also implemented as one of Frank West's hyper combos in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars), the Mega Man Battle Network series as merchandise found throughout the games, and Onimusha 3: Demon Siege as a weapon. They are voiced by Chisa Yokoyama.[CR]    * Mistress Sera and Mistress Yuna are "Mother Units" specifically designed to watch over Elysium and Terra. Sera, jealous of the attention MegaMan receives from the Master, the final living human and overseer of Elysium, does battle with MegaMan after he is ordered by the Master to destroy the System Library. She is defeated and sealed on Forbidden Island by Yuna, and Yuna also takes care of MegaMan. Yuna inhabits the body of Matilda, Roll's mother, because she used her own body to repair Matilda's dying body. They are served by Gatz and Geetz, who have the ability to change from humanoid forms to large bird forms.[CR]    * MegaMan Juno is the master of all the ruins on Kattelox Island. He is awakened by Volnutt, and he attempts to reinitialize the island's systems, which have the potential to kill the island's inhabitants.[CR]    * Lex Loath is a loan shark, who wishes to awaken the Sleeping Colossus, a giant Reaverbot. His main henchman is Glyde, the leader of the "Birdbots", small bird-like robots.[CR]    * Bola and Klaymoor are two veteran pirates, who search for the keys to the Mother Lode, though only Klaymoor really cares. Bola wields a claw and a sword, while Klaymoor has a machine gun as a replacement for his arm.[CR][CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/913960-mega-man-64[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Legends[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Zenny Glitch[CR]This glitch can be executed after opening the Central Gate (the three doors in the Main Gate opened with the three Sub-City keys). Speak with Data there and say "I keep losing fights...", then "Yes" to his next question, and "No" to his next two questions. As a result, you can repeat this process infinitely, gaining 1,100 Zenny each time. (Note: If you say "Yes" to his third question - the second "No" question - you will earn a total of 56,100 Zenny, but can no longer get Zenny from Data.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Difficulty Settings[CR]Successfully complete the game to unlock the Hard difficulty setting. Successfully complete the game on the Hard difficulty - or the Normal difficulty in under three hours  - to unlock the Easy difficulty setting.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite money[CR]Go to Apple Market and kick the can into the bakery. The woman behind the counter will give you 1000 Zenny. Enter any shop and exit. The can will reappear. Repeat this as many times as needed. Note: This will still work when everyone leaves.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mickey's Speedway USA is a game released late in the life span of the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color consoles. With several tracks, characters and quirky items, it was an unique game compared to other kart racers. It is one of the few games developed by Rare to use a license from an outside company (Disney). The game sports a large cast of most major Disney characters. Both versions make use of the Transfer Pak to connect both games to unlock hidden features.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mickey's Speedway USA has a Grand Prix mode which works similarly to how the cups in Mario Kart 64 works, you have each cup containing 4 tracks and the characters race to acquire points, the better position you finish the race the more points you get, in the end of the cup whoever has more points wins. There's also modes to run against the clock and try to set the fastest time and multiplayer, being race and battle modes.[CR]The characters have different focuses, some focus on speed and less on playability, others won't focus on speed but will be a lot easier to make turns, while some are somewhat balanced.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Mickey Mouse[CR]Minnie Mouse[CR]Donald Duck[CR]Daisy Duck[CR]Goofy[CR]Pete[CR]Louie Duck[CR]Dewey Duck[CR]Huey Duck[CR]Professor Von Drake[CR]Items[CR]Spritzer: The standard speed boost item.[CR]Baseball Chucker: Explodes when hit by another racer.

		<title_clean>Milo's Astro Lanes</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Milo&#8217;s Astro Lanes is simple enough to understand: knock down all ten pins ten (eleven if you&#8217;re lucky!) times in a row, with two chances before they reset and your score for the round is marked down. These lanes &#8211; the things you roll the ball down &#8211; have been changed throughout the years, and now that it is the 22nd century it&#8217;s possible to bowl in space, on other planets and even in a park. There are two modes, a league mode for a single player to go through each setting the game has to offer and try to beat the computer, earning trophies and completing challenges as you go. There is also a multiplayer mode, where you choose your ball, character and level and compete against up to three other people in space bowling. Utilize eight different power-ups scattered throughout the levels to help yourself or hurt your foes, ranging from a goo ball to a white dwarf.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are six characters that you can play as: Milo, Ann Droid, Dr. Onuki, Nutian Warbler, Johnny Slamball, and 10 PIN. Each has their own distinct model making it easy for you to tell who you&#8217;re playing as in the heat of the moment, but they largely play the same.[CR]Lanes[CR]There are twelve lanes in total in Milo&#8217;s Astro Lanes, five unique settings each with their own bowling alley. They range from a volcano on Venus, to the inside of an alien&#8217;s mouth, to a park![CR]Hyperspace Express: Hyperspace Express is perhaps the most basic of the Astro Lanes, but it quickly becomes complex. The first incarnation is a simple lane with a short hop, but the second adds bumps and side lanes to the half before the hop. Express III adds a large hole in the center which makes it much harder to get to the pins without a gutter ball.[CR]Venus Vacation: How about Venus? Another fairly straightforward level, except the pins are located in an active volcano which regularly erupts and may disrupt your ball with a splash of the magma erupting from the top. Venus II creates a second chasm for you to hurdle and in the third the geometry itself begins to warp, making it hard to traverse the other red planet.[CR]Alien Invasion: A lane on a giant alien head&#8217;s tongue, this particular level comes in three flavors. The first is very basic, with no obstacles to speak of, but Invasion II brings an alien spaceship to zap the ball (and the tongue!), slowing it down. The alien will bite down on his own tongue in regular intervals, making it harder for you to hit the pins. Invasion III is the same as II but the lane has been shrunk down significantly, giving an added challenge.[CR]Asteroid Terror: Unlocked in the second tier of the tournament mode, Asteroid Terror is a fairly standard lane with some environmental hazards to beware of. The first version of it just has a short bump in the center and is a straightaway, but the second incarnation has a larger bump and spills out to make a bowl shape, though it&#8217;s a bit hard to miss the pins. Both versions come with blue rabbits that pop out and deflect your ball away, Terror II&#8217;s version having more places for these bunnies to show up.[CR]Nebulous Park: Nebulous Park is only available in the last tier of the levels in the league play. It is a park in space, with a large hill and a tree in the background that houses the pins. The hill is especially problematic in getting the pins to the ball safely, so it&#8217;s easy to see why this is reserved for those who have persevered through to the final area.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Throughout the course of the game there are power-ups scattered around the field in the form of colored stars. You can hold one of each star, and use each in an offensive and defensive way; the latter you may only use when it is your opponent&#8217;s turn.[CR]Green: An offensive use of the green star turns it into the turbo ball, which is good for getting your ball out of danger but tends to cause more problems than it solves. Using it on the enemy drops a goo ball, causing it to corrode and eventually disappear.[CR]Yellow: Using it on your own ball turns it into a megaball, arguably the strongest power-up in the game. Using it on the enemy turns it into the peaball, making it harder to hit the pins but it&#8217;s still possible to hit them so it&#8217;s not as useful as some of the powers that stop play completely.[CR]Red: Using it on yourself replaces your ball with a white dwarf; in effect, it resets the state of your current ball. Using the red star it on the enemy makes their ball bounce with the help of a spring, each getting higher until it eventually bounces into space.[CR]Blue: Using a blue star on yourself creates two clones at your side which is a good defensive use for green, red and blue stars that may be coming at you, as well as making it easier to get easy pins. Using the blue star on the enemy drops a bomb that explodes and destroys the main ball, but leaves all clones alone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]When it's your turn to bowl, press:</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mischief Makers is an action-platformer for the Nintendo 64 developed by Treasure. In the game, the player controls Marina Liteyears, the robotic maid of Professor Theo, who is kidnapped while visiting the planet Clancer. It's up to Marina to save Professor Theo and the people of Clancer from an imperial invasion. One of the first 2D action games on the system, the game received mixed reviews.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]On a visit to planet "Clancer," Professor Theo, creator of Marina Liteyears, is kidnapped by the mysterious Empire while Marina is out. Upon realizing that the Professor has been kidnapped, Marina sets out to stop the Empire and rescue the Professor. On her journey, she meets the citizens of Clancer, takes part in a Olympic style mini-game festival, fights agents of the Empire and faces off against the Emperor himself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a side-scrolling platformer in which Marina's primary abilities are grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects as a means to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Shaking in particular has a wide range of effects such as causing enemies to drop gems or causing a projectile to grow larger before throwing it back at an enemy.[CR]The game had an unique mechanic involving the ending sequence and the collection of 52 "golden gems," special items that could be obtained by performing special tasks within the game's levels and including shaking certain enemies, projectiles or bits of scenery, beating mini-games in record times or clearing a stage without being hit once in the case of the several boss battles. How much the player is allowed to watch the complete ending depended entirely on how many gems they collected, with each gem adding 3 seconds of viewing time. If there were not enough gems to watch the entire cutscene, the game would interrupt the sequence and urge the player (and Marina) to collect more. If the player collects all of the golden gems, Marina is transformed into a human girl at the very end of the game.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Marina Liteyears - The main protagonist of the game and the person the player controls. She's trying to rescue Professor Theo.Professor Theo - The creator of Marina. He is kidnapped at the very beginning of the game by the Empire.Teran - A friendly Clancer wearing a baseball cap. He helps out Marina in a number of ways throughout the game.Lunar - One of the Beastector.Tarus - One of the Beastector.Merco - One of the Beastector.Emperor - The mysterious entity that runs the Empire.[CR]Development[CR]Treasure's CEO, Masato Maegawa, has stated that during development there was an average of 12 staff members working on the game. The maximum amount of staff working on the game was 15.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Mission Impossible</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Mission Impossible was announce alongside Goldeneye 007 as one of the first games for the Nintendo 64 system. Both games suffered numerous delays and were released way past the release dates of their films (In both cases almost a two year gap.) The game loosely borrowed it's plot from the 1996 film Mission: Impossible, starring Tom Cruise. Major strokes from the film play as centerpieces for the game, such as the iconic CIA computer room heist. The game was unable to secure the likeness of Tom Cruise, and subsequently features a generic character model for the main character, Ethan Hunt.[CR]Plot: Similarities &amp; Differences from the Film[CR]The story arc of the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt remains mostly intact in this adaptation. The NOC (Non-Official Cover-agents) list has been stolen, revealing the true identities of many CIA operatives. Hunt has been tasked to recover the list, and in the process is pinned as the CIA "mole," working secretly for the enemy. It is revealed to the player that Hunt has been framed, and must now clear his name while being chased by the CIA. [CR] Major key plot points which are unchanged in the game:Jim Phelps, leader of Hunt's IMF team, is revealed to be the actual moleHunt, incognito, must attend a foreign state dinner party; a hidden passage leads to the basement and supposed location of the missing NOC listHunt stealthily descends into a heavily secured CIA computer room, to retrieve the actual NOC listPhelps and Hunt face off on top of a speeding train; Hunt is successful in fouling Phelps' plan to escape via helicopter [CR]Major plot differences: Jim's wife, Claire, is nonexistent in the game; Candice is now the leading female love interest for HuntCandice also features a unique backstory from the film; She is one of Hunt's fellow secret agents who has been captured by the enemy, and player helps her escape early in the gameTwo "ice levels" bookend the game, exploring Hunt's additional IMF missions[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ethan Hunt, suspended over lasers in the CIA computer room[CR]Mission: Impossible's gameplay relies on stealth and disguise. Players have the ability to use the "Facemaker" to create identical masks of certain character targets, such as an enemy General. While disguised, the player will not be detected by enemies or surveillance cameras; however drawing a weapon, or delivering a kick will immediately expose Hunt. Many reviewers and gamers alike criticized the fact that even drawing a weapon could constitute a mission failure that would cause the player's game to end, Because of the game's close relationship with Goldeneye (Both titles were announced nearly simotaniously as some of the first N64 titles), a game that elavated the shooter genre, many were surprised that Mission Impossible penalized gamers for wanting to shoot enemies. The CIA computer room level features a wire hanging mechanic, similar to the film, in that the player cannot touch the ground, or be seen by any CIA operatives entering of leaving the sealed computer room. The third person action is sometimes replaced by rail shooter sequences, as well as a sniper level. [CR]Easter Egg[CR]Upon completing the game, the player is free to roam the state party level, where members of the Infogrames development team appear as character models. The player can trigger unique dialogue from each member of the team. (For example: The male with long hair states "I need a haircut," and the bald programmer states "I don't need a haircut."[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.[CR]Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.</plot>

The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent.

		<title_clean>Mortal Kombat 4</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sub-Zero with his Freeze Wand.[CR]Mortal Kombat 4 is a 3D fighting game developed and released by Midway on October 1997 for arcades. The game makes a significant shift to 3D while introducing weapon-based combat to the franchise. The setting reverts from the gritty, Western look of Mortal Kombat 3 to mythical, Eastern look of the first two Mortal Kombat games.[CR]The game has three revisions within a year, fixing various bugs and adding new secrets, bugfixes and features. The game was also ported to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in late June 1998, the PC in late July 1998, and was a launch title for the Sega Dreamcast under the name Mortal Kombat Gold. These home versions added exclusive content, including new characters and FMV intros, biographies, and endings. The game was also ported to the Game Boy Color in 1998 by Digital Eclipse.[CR]Taking place after the events of Mortal Kombat 3, the plot of Mortal Kombat 4 revolves around the war between the God of Thunder Raiden (along with the warriors of Earthrealm) and the fallen Elder God Shinnok (along with the evil sorceror Quan Chi and their army of darkness).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Despite the transition to 3D, the game plays very similarly to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Players have four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick), a Block button, and a Run button. Players have a Run Meter to prevent them from abusing the Run button, which gives them a quick dash forward for offensive manuevers. Players can now sidestep left and right (by tapping the Run button twice), allowing them to dodge projectiles and move the camera so that other players can not pick up items on the ground as easily.[CR]The "chain combo" system is still intact, where players use strings of normal attacks to perform a pre-programmed combo. However, Mortal Kombat 4 has added a "Maximum Damage" cap, automatically breaking off combos (in a similar vein to Killer Instinct's " Combo Breaker").[CR]One main concept introduced to the Mortal Kombat franchise in Mortal Kombat 4 is weapon-based combat. Players perform a specific button and joystick combination and the character would equip a weapon (usually a sword, an axe, or a club). The weapon deals more damage and changes certain attacks (Fujin's Crossbow, for example, can fire bolts). The weapon is knocked out of the player's hand on the first attack landed by an opponent, in which that weapon can be picked up by either player by pressing down on the joystick and the Run button. Some stages have objects (such as rocks in Goro's Lair) scattered around that can also be picked up and thrown at opponents.[CR]Some mechanics from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 were scrapped, including Friendships, Babalities, Animalities, the ability to show " Mercy", eight-player tournament mode, and mid-match stage transitions. There are no Endurance Matches, instead bringing back 2-on-2 mode.[CR]This is the first Mortal Kombat game to not include palette swaps, as each character is visually unique. This also marks the first game to include the ability to select an alternate costume (by holding the Start button while selecting a character).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The fifteen playable fighters from the Arcade version.[CR]The original Arcade release includes 15 starting playable characters and one secret playable character. Raiden, Liu Kang, Reptile, Scorpion, Jax, Johnny Cage, Sub-Zero, and Sonya return from previous Mortal Kombat games. New fighters include Shinnok (the fallen Elder God and boss of the game who has the ability to switch movesets to other characters in a similar way as Shang Tsung), Quan Chi (the evil sorceror and sub-boss of the game), Fujin (the God of Wind and ally of Raiden), Kai (a Shaolin monk and ally of Liu Kang), Reiko (general of Shinnok's army), Tanya (a female ninja of Edenia with shady motives), and Jarek (the last surviving member of Kano's clan, the Black Dragon). A secret easter egg changes the player's character to Meat, a bloody skeleton.[CR]All of the home versions (with the exception of the Game Boy Color version) added more characters from previous Mortal Kombat games. Goro from the original Mortal Kombat was a sub-boss that was playable with a cheat code. Noob Saibot was also playable with a cheat code. Mortal Kombat Gold for the Sega Dreamcast added Kitana, Mileena, Cyrax, Kung Lao, and Baraka as playable characters with Sektor as a secret playable character.Kai (not available in the Game Boy Color version)RaidenShinnok (boss)Liu KangReptile (secret character in the Game Boy Color version)ScorpionJax (not available in the Game Boy Color version)ReikoJohnny Cage (not available in the Game Boy Color version)Jarek (not available in the Game Boy Color version)TanyaFujinSub-ZeroQuan Chi (sub-boss in the Arcade version)Sonya (not available in the Game Boy Color version)Meat (secret character, not available in the Game Boy Color version)Noob Saibot (secret character, not available in the Arcade or Game Boy Color versions)Goro (sub-boss and secret character, not available in the Arcade or Game Boy Color versions)Kitana (only available in the Dreamcast version)Mileena (only available in the Dreamcast version)Cyrax (only available in the Dreamcast version)Kung Lao (only available in the Dreamcast version)Baraka (only available in the Dreamcast version)Sektor (secret character only available in the Dreamcast version)[CR]Arenas[CR]The MountainsReptile&#8217;s LairThe Shaolin TempleThe Living ForestThe PrisonGoro&#8217;s LairThe FurnaceBase of the HeavensThe Tomb[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 2-Player Mode Cheats[CR]Enter the following on the screen before the match:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Goro[CR]To unlock Goro, you have to either beat the game with Shinnok or unlock the hidden option cheat (hold Block + Run for 10 seconds while highlighting "Continue" on the Options). Now, at the character screen, select "hidden", then move the invisible cursor to Shinnok, hold Start + Block, release Start, and press Run.You can also just press Block + Run, but it's difficult to press them both at the same time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Automatic Fatalities[CR]Go to the Continue Options screen, then press and hold Block+Run for ten seconds.</plot>

		<title_clean>Mortal Kombat Mythologies - Sub-Zero</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] Sub-Zero, the titular protagonist     Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is a 2D action-adventure platformer developed and published by  Midway for the                                  Sony PlayStation on October 1, 1997. Ported to the                                Nintendo 64 on December 8, 1997 by                               Avalanche, Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is a                             spin-off title to the                              Mortal Kombat fighting game series, focusing on a narrow group of primary characters while serving as a prologue to the original                            Mortal Kombat (similar to                           Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, released three years later). The game blends fighting game mechanics of                          Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 with a beat-em-up platformer, adding some elements of RPGs (such as an inventory system and                         experience point system, where the player learns new special moves as he defeats opponents). Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is also the last Mortal Kombat game to feature                        digitized characters and the only Mortal Kombat game to have                     live-action cutscenes.In the game, players take the role of the              original      Sub-Zero (a ninja of the            Lin Kuei clan with the mastery of           frost-based attacks) who, after infiltrating the                 Shaolin Temple to steal the Sacred                Map of Elements (defeating, with the potential of killing,               Scorpion in the process), is sent by the mysterious sorceror        Quan Chi to retrieve a mysterious       amulet located in the Temple of Elements. It is revealed later, however, that Quan Chi is using this amulet to resurrect the dark fallen Elder God      Shinnok. After being confronted by     Raiden, god of thunder, the player must travel to the    Netherrealm, searching for the whereabouts of Quan Chi while fighting his three assassins (Kia, Jataaka, and   Sareena).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like Mortal Kombat 3, Mythologies consisted of 4 attack buttons, a block button, and a run button.  The game also used a "turn" button to deal with attackers on   either side of Sub-Zero, accompanied by an &#8220;action&#8221; button used for items. The gameplay took place on a 2D plane that consisted of a fighting system very similar to that of the Mortal Kombat fighting series. The "turn" button would alleviate the issue of Sub-Zero turning away from an opponent while performing a special move.  Platforming was also part of the 2D scrolling gameplay. Sub-Zero&#8217;s special abilities extinguished  an &#8220;Ice Meter&#8221; that was replenished by retrieving items.    Sub-Zero does not start the game with all his special abilities. The aforementioned "Ice Meter" does not appear until Sub-Zero learns abilities that use it. The system is very RPG-like in nature as it tracks experience points, ability upgrades, and inventory.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Here are the passwords for each level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bloopers[CR]Fill your Ice Meter.  Beat the Demon using Polar Blast.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Watch Scorpion F.M.V. + Unlock Scorpion as Final Boss[CR]Play the first level, when you get to Scorpion beat him. Do the fatality (F,D,F HP -one step away) and grab the scroll. Run to the rope and climb up. Pause the game, and exit. Go to the password screen and enter the code: RGTKCS.  Fight the enemies and get caught. You will then see an F.M.V. with Scorpion's spirit instead of Shinnok. You must then fight Scorpion a second time, as the boss.</plot>

		<title_clean>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a compilation of each previous Mortal Kombat game, bringing them together in a new, single title. Every fighter and most levels from every preceding title returns, bringing the total roster to over 32 fighters. Due to technical limitations at the time, there are several slight differences between the CD and cartridge based versions, most relating to the need to load and cache things on the CD version before play, such as transformations for Shang Tsung in order to reduce loading during a fight (an issue that existed in Mortal Kombat 3 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3). The most obvious difference is the extension of the " Shao Kahn's Treasure" in the Nintendo 64 version, where players have twenty-four options to pick from instead of twelve seen in the other versions. The CD versions feature more bosses than the N64 version as well as improved sound quality. Conversely, the Nintendo 64 version lacks several characters seen in the disc versions because of a lack of space on the cartridge. These are mainly classic versions of several characters, but two bosses were excluded as well: Goro and Kintaro.[CR]In 1998, Mortal Kombat 4 proceeded Mortal Kombat Trilogy on home consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat Trilogy uses the same story as Mortal Kombat 3, which has Shao Kahn acting as the main antagonist. Shao Kahn is presented as the millennium-old emperor of Outworld, a dark world that exists in parallel to Earth. Many years ago, the Elder Gods created the Mortal Kombat tournament in order to prevent an invasion from Outworld. For many years, Goro reigned as the supreme champion of the tournament, but eventually Liu Kang defeated him and became the new champion. Liu Kang, along with other fighters from the tournament, were drawn into Outworld and forced to compete in a new tournament. But the tournament was merely a ruse to distract the warriors from his true intentions: resurrecting Queen Sindel and taking over Earth. At the onset of the game, players must fight their way up the tournament roster, eventually reaching Shao Kahn and defeating him, thwarting his invasion and releasing many souls of fallen warriors from his body.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat Trilogy plays much like its predecessor Mortal Kombat 3/UMK3, with a few additions. Several characters have new moves, previously not seen in the series or ones that had to be cut for one reason or another. Another addition was the "Aggression" bar, which would increase as a player landed successful hits on their opponent; when the bar filled, they would temporarily move faster and deal more damage.[CR]Players can choose from the story-based Tournament mode as well as other arcade modes for quick matches. In the Tournament mode, a player selects one character and then battles their way up a tower of AI controlled opponents until the eventual showdown with Shao Kahn. The higher the difficulty level a player chooses, the more combatants they much fight as well as an overall increase in AI competency. A player works their way up the tower by beating each opponent in a standard match of first to get two victories. At the end of the second victory, the announcer shouts "Finish Him!" and players are able to perform a hallmark " Fatality" or any other finishing move that had been introduced in previous titles, including " Animalities," " Babalities," " Friendships" and the new " Brutalities," 11-input combos that result in the explosion of their opponent. Players will face off with bosses at various segments throughout their progression up the tower, most of which are less phased by attacks than a standard foe. The final boss of the tower is Shao Kahn, and upon defeating him, players can choose a "treasure" which demonstrates a certain aspect of the game or in one case on the Nintendo 64, shows each finishing attack for every character in the game.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The Character Select Screen from the PlayStation, PC, and Sega Saturn versions.[CR]The character roster is built from the roster from the console versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, adding characters and appearances from previous Mortal Kombat games while making boss characters playable. The PlayStation, PC, and Sega Saturn versions of the game include the full roster with the exception of Khameleon (bringing its total roster to 37). The Nintendo 64 version of the game includes Khameleon as a secret character, but leaves out Chameleon, Kano and Raiden's MK1 appearances, Jax and Kung Lao's MK2 appearances, unmasked Sub-Zero, Goro, and Kintaro (bringing its total roster to 30). The Game.com port includes only 13 playable characters.[CR]Johnny Cage is the only character in the game to receive entirely new digitized graphics (using another actor). Some characters received new graphics, primarily due to missing animations. The two new characters, Chameleon and Khameleon, are simply based on the male and female ninja bases from UMK3.Johnny Cage (not available in the Game.com version)Noob Saibot (console Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Baraka (Mortal Kombat II, not available in the Game.com version)Cyrax (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sonya (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Raiden (known in the game as Rayden, Mortal Kombat II (with secret Mortal Kombat appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64 and Game.com))Rain (console Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Shang Tsung (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Kitana (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Kano (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (with secret Mortal Kombat appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64), not available in the Game.com version)Scorpion (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Sub-Zero (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, both masked and un-masked in all versions except Nintendo 64 (where only masked Sub-Zero is included), not available in the Game.com version)Smoke (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, both human and robot, not available in the Game.com version)Reptile (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Jax (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (with secret Mortal Kombat II appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64), not available in the Game.com version)Mileena (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sektor (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Liu Kang (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Jade (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sheeva (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Kung Lao (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (with secret Mortal Kombat II appearance in all versions except Nintendo 64), not available in the Game.com version)Nightwolf (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Sindel (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Ermac (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Stryker (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Kabal (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, not available in the Game.com version)Goro (Mortal Kombat, not available in the Nintendo 64 or Game.com versions)Shao Kahn (final boss, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Motaro (boss, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)Kintaro (Mortal Kombat II, not available in the Nintendo 64 or Game.com versions)Chameleon (secret character, not available in the Nintendo 64 or Game.com versions)Khameleon (secret character, Nintendo 64 version only)[CR]</plot>

There are three separate tracks with some minor route variations in each.  Each course has  2-4 alternate segments that are turned on and off similar to Ridge Racer.[CR]The graphics have some variety as well.  The courses are: Sea Side (Easy), Mountain (Normal), and Down Town (Hard).  The look and handling of each changes as well with weather variations such as rain and snow.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Oedo town is being trashed by mysterious peach shaped space ship looking to turn all of japan into a stage for their perverse arts. It is up to Goemon and Ebisumaru to save lord of Oedo town and the rest of Japan from these peach obsessed degenerates. During their quest they are joined by Yae, Sasuke and a giant robot. You will also need more GATE PASSES![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Adventure Mode[CR]The majority of Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is a 3D action adventure game played from the 3rd-person perspective. It is very similar to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, although Mystical Ninja was released first. The game contains open-world exploration as well as separate dungeons and puzzle gameplay. In between the open-world areas are towns which feature shops where players can buy items, heal, or get hints on where to go next. The player can switch control between the four primary characters to take advantage of their individual powers. Players can also collect items to upgrade their basic weapons to do more damage.Characters[CR]Goemon: A blue-haired ninja and one of two characters available from the start of the game. His main weapon is a pipe, and his secondary weapon is throwing golden coins, or Ryo. His special ability is the chain pipe, which can be used similarly to Link's hookshot.[CR]Ebisumaru: A slightly odd ninja, and the second of two characters immediately available. His main weapon is a mallet, and his secondary weapon is a "meat mallet," which turns enemies into health upgrades. His special ability is a camera which can reveal hidden objects.[CR]Yae: A female ninja who tries to keep the group in check. Her main weapon is a katana, and her secondary weapon is a bazooka which costs money to fire, but can lock onto foes. Her special ability is a flute which, when played, can transport the player to any town they have visited.[CR]Sasuke: A small, mechanical ninja. His main weapon are Kunai, and his secondary weapon is a small bomb. His special ability is to fire ice kunai, which can cool down heated areas.Impact Mode[CR]Mystical Ninja's boss battles are third person action, as well as first-person fighting sequences played from the cockpit of a giant robot named Impact. At certain scripted events (usually at the end of a dungeon), Goemon blows a magical conch shell summoning Impact after a brief cutscene.[CR]The sequence begins with a third person 3d sidescroller, where impact must destroy as many obsticles as he can while skating forwards and trying to avoid death. He can swing his clubs to break buildings and destroy airborne enemies, as well as shoot coins at ground units.[CR]After the third-person segment, Impact enters first person mode and gains new attacks. Impact's attacks include hitting with a giant hammer and punching with extending arms. Impact is also able to shoot out coins at enemy robots. When the opportunity presents itself, Impact can perform combo attacks such as multiple punches combined with a finishing kick.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is set in a fictional medieval Japan. After seeing a large, peach-shaped spaceship crash into the nearby castle, Goemon and Ebisumaru travel to the castle to save the Lord of Odea. Upon arriving Goemon meets a member of the "Gang of Four" who wish to convert Japan into a stage for them to perform on, and turn all of the people into a loyal audience. Goemon must then embark to stop the Gang of Four, meeting and helping the ninjas Yae and Sasuke along the way while seeking help from the eccentric "Wise Man."[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]As the story of the game is about an outer-space theater troupe attacking Japan, music plays a major role. For instance, the game contains an opening music video with a theme song. Also, before the final boss battle the game's villains perform a musical number. The game's cinematics were fairly impressive for it's time as it was one of the first Nintendo 64 to feature songs with vocals. All of the vocals are in Japanese with english subtitles.Theme Song Lyrics[CR]"Fight on...[CR]Fight on...[CR]Never giving up[CR]Let's start our journey as we whistle along[CR]Going now[CR]Well, look at the sky[CR]Peeping through the clouds[CR]You can see, just how big the sky really is[CR]Even if the harsh winds were to take you away[CR]Live your life the way YOU want it,[CR]That is the destiny for many[CR]Fight on...[CR]Fight on...[CR]There is more than one dream,[CR]If we reach for it hard enough...[CR]TAKE A CHANCE![CR]Fight on...[CR]Fight on...[CR]Never giving up[CR]Let's start our journey as we whistle along[CR]Going now"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boss Mode[CR]Collect 45 fortune dolls.

Konami's Olympics video game recreates some of the events and locales seen at the 1998 Nagano Olympic games.  The player has nine different sports to choose from and compete in, and may compete as one of sixteen different nations to choose from.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The gameplay for Nagano '98 consists of the player taking control of an Olympic team, and using that Olympic team through twelve events based from the Winter Olympic Games. Nagano '98 represents the Winter Olympic Games that were held in Nagano. In Nagano '98 t he player has to either press different buttons, or simultaneously press two buttons back and forth, much like previously released Track &amp; Field games, and play very similar to those, but winter sports. For the skiing, luge, and bobsledding all have similar control, with you taking control over your character or sleigh team, and skiing having you maneuver around colored flags. In ski jumping you'll have to press certain buttons at correct times, or hold them at tight timing while moving the d-pad to perfect yo ur landing. In curling you'll have to pick what curve and how much to sweep and so forth.  Also, in skating you'll have to repeatedly tap two face buttons simultaneously as fast as you can without breaking formula to gain and keep speed throughout the event.  There are also a few other events which can play similar in controls, or may tweak them a bit. Through the single player you'll have to qualify in seven events to advance, and the game will save high score progress, and will keep you trying to get the high score, with four player multiplayer as well.  Multiplayer is also played similar to single player, as two -four players can challenge each other in random or chosen events for Gold, Silver, or Bronze, and fourth recieves nothing. At the end of all of the events the total medals will be added, and each medal counting for a different point tally, and whoever has the highest total point value at the end is victorious.   High score can also be achieved by anyone and will be saved for that specific event.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam 2000 is a game that was released in 1999 for the       Nintendo 64. The game's focus was all about realism and detail. The moves in the game are motion-captured based on Xavier McDaniels, offering smooth animations of 800 moves, including defensive grabs, push-offs, post-ups, and picks. Each of the hundreds of players is rendered with realistic facial features and signature moves. In addition there are over 200 categories of stats, detailed team management options--including the ability to draft, trade, sign, and release players--and improved replay options with multiple camera angles.[CR]Roster[CR]The roster information was accurate as of October 16, 1999.        Tim Duncan is the best overall rated player in the game with a rating of 99. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]2 on 2 "throwback" includes 50 dunk styles and special effects.5 on 5 simulation mode where each team displays its signature power plays such as the Bulls' "Triangle Defense".       [CR]Marketing[CR]According to      Acclaim in 1999,  NBA JAM 2000 was supported by a multi-million dollar television, radio, online and in-store marketing campaign and was considered a key title in the popular Acclaim Sports brand including     All-Star Baseball,    NFL Quarterback Club,   WWF Attitude and  Jeremy McGrath SuperCross.  [CR] Popular Culture[CR]In certain subcultures, the phrases "He's heating up" and "He's on fire" have entered into common usage. The phrases, as in the game, are used to (self) describe someone doing something successfully twice or thrice respectively. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Run Faster[CR]Begin the game in exhibition mode. Get possession of the ball and hold L + Z or R + Z when running to move faster. </plot>

To see every mission through, combo attacks (punches and kicks), blocking and grappling techniques are available at your disposal. Depending on the damage the Eva you control takes and if certain parameters are met during that time you will be given a time limit in which you must end the battle with the Angel. [CR]The Simulation Mode: almost plays like a shooter. Its a 1st-person perspective mode where you must eliminate as many Angels as possible within the time limit.

		<title_clean>New Tetris, The</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]There are three modes one can play in The New Tetris: marathon, sprint, and ultra. In marathon, you simply play until you lose. With the sprint gametype, you try to make as many lines as you can within the three minute time limit, and in ultra you are trying to clear 150 lines as fast as possible. This version of Tetris also has multiplayer, enough for up to four players at a time, and these same three game modes are also available for multiplayer, with added options for how you want to handle garbage: none, directed, or hot potato.New Features[CR]Besides being able to clear lines like in a classic Tetris game, you can now form gold and silver blocks by making a 4x4 square out of tetrominos. Lines with gold blocks in them, made out of all same-shaped tetrominos, are worth ten points where a standard line is worth one. Silver blocks can be formed from any four pieces as long as it results in a 4x4 square, but the line cleared is only worth five points.[CR]The New Tetris also features a wonder-building mode, where you build wonders such as the Sphinx, Stonehenge and the Pantheon out of the lines you clear in any of the game modes. You can check your current wonder's progress at any time. Once you complete the set, they are reset with even higher requirements.Hidden ROM Text[CR]There is a famous rant by David Pridie hidden inside the ROM for The New Tetris. Inside David rants about how he dislikes the game he made and wishes they could have had more time working on it to make the game he wanted. He also thanks several co-workers and Nintendo. The entire rant is over 2000 words long.[CR]There are several pieces of ASCII Art hidden in the ROM as well including a Canadian Flag, an N64 logo and the logo for the game as well as a few others. Additionally there are much smaller rants by some of the other developers as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fractals[CR]Set music mode to ''choose'', and put the song in as ''Haluci'', then make your name ''HALUCI''.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Block Rotation[CR]Rapidly press either button that rotates your block (A or B button) before it hits the ground, and the block will never fall!</plot>

		<title_clean>NFL Blitz</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]NFL Blitz is a port of the successful NFL Blitz arcade machines from Midway.The game features an extremely simplified interface, and gameplay to match. Rather an a simulation, Blitz is an extremely exaggerated version of football, with humongous players that can run extremely fast and deliver hits that send players flying tens of yards. Since all of the players have nearly superhuman abilities, the downs are done on a 30-yard basis instead of 10 yards. Plays are very limited with the simplified interface, and all kicks in the game are done automatically.The traditional rules of football do not exist in Blitz, so as to not slow down play. Pass interference, roughing the passer, and late hits are completely normal. Players also celebrated quite loudly after making hard hits or scoring. These aspects would be limited later on in the blitz series as the NFL became more strict with its license.You can keep track of your stats in NFL Blitz using a name and code, much like a fighting game. Certain names let you unlock special characters, such as Raiden.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Match-Up Codes[CR]Enter the following codes at the VS screen. The first is Turbo, then Jump, and then Pass. The numbers indicate how many times you have to press each number. Enter the following number and direction:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Characters[CR]Type this in were you put in your name and pin: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hide Cursor While Making Plays[CR]When you're on the play selection screen, you can hide the cursor so others can't see the play you choose. To do this, highlight the upper-left play (where the cursor is before you move it), then press Up on the Control Stick twice to hide the cursor.</plot>

		<title_clean>NFL Blitz - Special Edition</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NFL Blitz Special Edition was developed by Point of View and published by Midway. It was released on November 28, 2001 in Blockbuster rental stores. It was the both the final Blitz--as well as football--release for the Nintendo 64.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] was very similar to that of Blitz 2001, with nearly no changes being made.[CR]Presentation[CR]Like gameplay, the presentation of Blitz SE was the same of the Blitz 2001 release. The biggest differential between the two games was the fact that Blitz SE had an updated roster for the respective upcoming NFL season. All features and modes return from Blitz 2001.[CR]Release[CR]Blitz SE was part of a special Blockbuster promotion, giving Blockbuster the exclusive release and sales for the game. Blockbuster initially had put it on shelves as a "rent only" title, but the game was placed on sale in their stores just weeks later. Because of this, the game was not widely available and did not produce sales numbers akin to those of previous Blitz releases. Razor Freestyle Scooter for the Nintendo 64 was also released under the same sales structure.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Codes[CR]At the ''Vs.'' screen before the game starts, enter the following codes using the (first) turbo, (second) jump, and (third) pass buttons followed by a direction on the D-pad. Press each one the amount of times indicated. </plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Building on the same format used in previous NFL Blitz games, Midway released NFL Blitz 2001 on September 12, 2000. The game was released on a handful of platforms, notably the first and only NFL Blitz release for the Sega Dreamcast. The game was also the first of the series to not be released in arcade-cabinet format, wherein the game has not been released since. Blitz 2001 was the last Blitz release for the original Playstation. A slightly modified version of NFL Blitz 2001 was re-released on the Nintendo 64 as "NFL Blitz: Special Edition".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] stayed essentially the same to previous Blitz releases. The same animations, mechanics, and A.I. tendencies were carried over from Blitz 2000. There were slight improvements to the physics engine in the Dreamcast release which are noticeable during gameplay.[CR]Dreamcast[CR]The Dreamcast release of the game saw notable improvements in almost all aspects of the game including graphic quality, sound, and visual presentation. Player photos and statistics were added to relevant plays in-game, as were higher-resolution player models. Weather effects were added to the game, a feature not seen before. The Dreamcast version also featured a wider-angle camera during gameplay, allowing the player to see more of the field for more effective offense and defense.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Players[CR]Below is a list of their name and PIN #:[CR]ALEC      [CR]1197 [CR]ALIEN     [CR]1111 [CR]AOB      [CR]1111 [CR]AUBREY    [CR]7777 [CR]AZPOD     [CR]4777[CR]BOXER     [CR]2111[CR]BRAIN     [CR]1111[CR]CALEB     [CR]0996 [CR]CARLTN    [CR]1111 [CR]CURTIS    [CR]1111[CR]DANIEL    [CR]0604[CR]DAVID     [CR]3333[CR]DINO      [CR]1111[CR]EDDIE     [CR]3333[CR]FORDEN    [CR]1111[CR]FRANZ     [CR]1010 [CR]GENTIL    [CR]1111 [CR]GRINCH    [CR]0222[CR]GUIDO     [CR]2222[CR]GUMBY    [CR]8698[CR]JAPPLE    [CR]6660[CR]JASON     [CR]3141 [CR]JEFF      [CR]1111 [CR]JENIFR    [CR]3333 [CR]JOVE      [CR]6644 [CR]LEX       [CR]7777 [CR]LUIS      [CR]3333 [CR]MOOSE     [CR]1111[CR]MXV       [CR]1014 [CR]NATHAN    [CR]0515[CR]PIRATE    [CR]1111[CR]PUNKR     [CR]1221[CR]PUNKB     [CR]2112[CR]RAIDEN    [CR]3691[CR]RALPH     [CR]1111[CR]RANDU     [CR]6666[CR]ROOT      [CR]6000[CR]SAL       [CR]0201[CR]SHINOK    [CR]8337[CR]SHRUNK    [CR]6666[CR]SAD       [CR]1111[CR]SKULL     [CR]1111[CR]SMILE     [CR]1111[CR]THUG      [CR]1111[CR]TREX      [CR]1111[CR]TURMEL    [CR]0322 [CR]WHODAT    [CR]1844 [CR]</plot>

		<plot>After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.[CR]Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.[CR]As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selnne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.[CR]The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.[CR]Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]On the password screen:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] win stanley cup easy[CR]Select Dallas Stars as your team.

The game allowed players to hire and fire coaches throughout the season. Each coach gave the team various bonuses including things like improvement in skating, speed, shot power, and goaltending. This type of RPG element really added to the season mode in the game and was a precursor to what later hockey games would do.[CR]Like many other games at the time, players could make trades, sign players and create their own. Players could also create prospects and use them in their season mode. These prospects could be sent to the "minor leagues" in order to have their stats increase.[CR]Create-A-Player[CR]The game also featured a semi-robust create-a-player for the time. It allowed users to create their own players by picking a position, hometown, and other specifics. The game also allowed users to allocate a variety of points to specific talents. These included...Stick HandlingEnduranceAggressionCheckingToughnessDefensive AwarenessOffensive AwarenessShootingFightingSpeedSkatingShot PowerPassingAcceleration[CR]Extra Info/Misc.[CR]The game also featured different types of referees. This option could be set to random. Some games would have a referee that was very strict on all calls. They may call more penalties and not allow the player to take as many hits, etc. Other referees would look the other way and allow for bigger hits to occur without calling penalties.[CR]The create a player was extremely robust for the time. It allowed for over 20 different categories that players would put stats and points into.[CR]Every player in the game wears a visor/shield on their hockey helmet. In real life, only the American Hockey League (AHL) requires this.[CR]Keith Tkachuk (Captain of the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996-1997) was on the cover of the game.[CR]The game featured a PA Announcer that would make statements throughout the game promoting various made up products, telling the crowd about upcoming games, and letting various people know that they are wanted at the help desk.[CR]The "Glow Puck" also made an appearance in the game. This was something that FOX Sports started for their real NHL broadcasts on television. The puck would glow in the game to help make it easier for players to follow. The game also featured the "Puck Trail" which would give the puck a glowing tail to show where it was headed. This was another FOX Sports concept.[CR]Dave Lang has stated that he and Tom Carbone included slideshows of themselves and their exploits in a Junk.BIN file that could only be accessed with a never-revealed code. As of April 30, 2013, the slideshows have been found via GameShark (which can be seen here), although the codes to access them have not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Press C-Left, C-Right, C-Left, C-Right, R(2) at the main menu.

		<title_clean>Nightmare Creatures</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kalisto's PlayStation debut[CR]Nightmare Creatures is a third-person action adventure with heavy horror themes, allowing the player to choose between two player characters to defeat the evil that is corrupting London. Developed by the now-defunct Kalisto Entertainment and published by Activision, the game was released for the PlayStation on November 17th, 1997 and on the PC a month later. The game was then ported to the Nintendo 64 and released on November 30th, 1998. There was also plans to release it on the Sega Saturn, but it was quietly cancelled.[CR]Set against the real world backdrop of the Burning of Parliament in 1834, the game uses several liberties with actual events. Adam Crowley, the newly appointed leader of the Brotherhood of Hecate, is practicing dark arts and unleashing a horde of evil creatures. London&#8217;s only hope is Father Ignatius Blackward, an expert in the occult, and Nadia Franciscus, the gymnast daughter of a doctor.[CR]Centered mostly around melee combat, Nightmare Creatures is typically considered to be a brawler with horror elements rather than the typical survival horror theme that had been trending at the time. The player, controlling Father Ignatius Blackward or Nadia Franciscus, fights dozens of creatures that appear in the dark alleyways of real world towns within the City of London. If anything, the title is known for its eerie atmosphere and strange creature design, making it a perfect fit for the early PlayStation generation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]It all began before the Great Fire of 1666 when the Brotherhood of Hecate began experiments to transform a human into a more powerful being. Their plan was to overthrow London and then, eventually, the entire world. A writer by the name of Samuel Pepys (a true historical figure) joined the Brotherhood in 1660. Once the secret society began to develop progress, they created strong, mutated creatures which seemed to suffice for the Brotherhood, who began to develop a way to mass produce the creatures.[CR]Pepys, taking note of the strange goings-on, began to record the experiments in his diaries and began designing a way to stop the Brotherhood and their maddening experiments. On September 2nd, 1666, the society began to gather together in a warehouse to begin preparations for their creations. It was at this time that Samuel Pepys sprung into action, locking the members in the warehouse and burning it to the ground, killing everyone inside and destroying all of their research forever. The conflagration quickly spread throughout the city, resulting in the Great Fire of London.[CR]Nearly 170 years pass by and a massive plague has begun to sweep through the city. Those who are infected begin to mutate and disappear into the dark alleys and sewers scattered throughout the massive streets of London. Father Ignatius Blackward is called out to Chelsea by a local parish, desperate to find a solution. Soon after these events unfold, an old blackened tome is left on the priest&#8217;s doorstep. Father Ignatius, being an expert in all things occult including cabalist writings, begins to decipher some of the decaying book and discovers that it is one of Samuel Pepys&#8217; diaries. Upon further investigation, the priest notices an entry which details the activity of the Brotherhood of Hecate, primarily their formula for creating organic mutations. He then sends the diary to a colleague in New Orleans, Doctor Jean Franciscus, who is a historian and an expert in secret societies.Adam Crowley[CR]After reading the diary, Doctor Franciscus journeys to London with his daughter Nadia, who is interested in pursuing a gymnastic league in the city. Once they arrive, the doctor meets Father Ignatius in order to discuss his findings. The next morning, the priest is overcome with a powerful vision. He makes his way to Jean&#8217;s hotel room, only to find him fatally wounded. As Ignatius kneels down next to him, the doctor whispers his final words, &#8220;Murder. Adam Crowley. The Brotherhood of He... The journal is gone...&#8221; Nadia arrives from a gymnastics meeting to find after her father dead and Ignatius nearby. She quickly begins to question the priest who recites her father&#8217;s final words. She vows to avenge his death by killing Adam Crowley and destroying the Brotherhood of Hecate once and for all.[CR]At Doctor Franciscus&#8217; funeral, a man in black robes named Henry Victor intercepts Nadia and hands her a note that reads &#8220;Know about Adam Crowley, Brotherhood of Hecate -- HV.&#8221; An address is written at the bottom of the note. On October 17th, 1834, Nadia meets with Father Ignatius at the church he is staying at in Chelsea in order to begin their search for Adam Crowley, starting with the address on the note.[CR]The adventure begins on the streets of Chelsea where Nadia and Ignatius begin tracking down Adam Crowley. There is a sudden realization that things have gone awry as they fight through several of Crowley&#8217;s experiments through the streets of London. After finally making their way to Crowley&#8217;s lab, they find that it has already been destroyed and set ablaze in order to hide any evidence of his involvement. As they close in, Crowley becomes desperate and drinks the last of his formula, turning into a hideous monstrosity.[CR]After a fierce battle, Crowley is defeated on the rooftops of Westminster Abbey and all of his creations burn in the flames. As Nadia and Ignatius escape to safety, it&#8217;s made clear that all of the Brotherhood of Hecade&#8217;s research has been destroyed once more and the two heroes would disappear into obscurity. However, back on the rooftops, a shadowy figure in black robes retrieves the head of Adam Crowley before disappearing himself.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]One of the two main protagonists that the player selects before beginning the game. Ignatius, as a master of studying the occult, enters Chelsea in search of clues to the strange disappearances around town. After studying the diary of Samuel Pepys, he begins his journey across London to stop the Brotherhood of Hecate. This priest has been trained in martial arts, excelling specifically in bo staff mastery, which he uses liberally to destroy the mutated creatures throughout the city.Father Ignatius BlackwardThe second protagonist that the player selects before beginning the game. As the daughter of Doctor Jean Franciscus, Nadia is a master of immunology. She accompanies her father to London to continue studying gymnastics, but she is soon caught in the evil plans of the Brotherhood of Hecate after her father is murdered. A practicing fencer, Nadia uses a variety of swords and heightened agility in her quest to stop the Brotherhood.Nadia Franciscus[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fighting off a Docker[CR]Nightmare Creatures allows the player to choose a character at the beginning of the game. Ignatius is the stronger of the two, but Nadia is much faster than Ignatius. Either decision does not affect many elements of the game, as the environments and story play out exactly the same. The player progresses through sixteen levels (not including boss fights) by battling the titular nightmare creatures that roam the streets of London. Each level offers a variety of encounters and the player must use a set of melee combinations in order to survive.[CR]Each character has their own combos and the ability to block, but the only thing that will allow the player to truly survive is by the game&#8217;s adrenaline meter. This meter is separate from the player&#8217;s health meter and will deplete when there are no monsters to fight. As the player runs out of adrenaline, so does the health slowly dwindle until the virus eventually takes hold. The only way to replenish adrenaline is to defeat monsters, which fills the meter instantaneously. There are also a number of power ups in order to help the player progress, although none of them replenish adrenaline.ItemEffectGunKills most creatures in one shot if fired straight ahead.Multi GunKills all nearby creatures.Healing BallRestores 30% Health.Large Healing BallRestores 100% Health.HeartGrants one extra life.Proximity MineKills any creature that steps on it.Repulsive SmokeUnleashes an odor that scares off creatures, sending them running away.FlashStuns enemies, causing them to stop attacking.TorchSets any creature in front of the player on fire.BerzerkerTemporarily grants one-hit melee kills.FreezeInstantly kills all creatures nearby, encasing them in ice and shattering.ChaosConfuses all creatures nearby and causes them to attack each other.Weapon UpgradeUpon finding each upgrade, the player receives a more powerful weapon and more health for the duration of the game. These are only found in India Docks, City, and Bloomsbury.Level Recap[CR]While combat has a central role in the game, the player must also traverse dangerous areas of platform jumping. Usually, these platforms are surrounded by water which will instantly kill the player should they fall in. The game uses a set amount of lives to track the player and the character dies, they respawn at the exact same area they were killed, consuming one of their lives in the process. Should the player run out of lives, the game is over and they return to the start screen.[CR]Once the player reaches the end of each level, they are graded with a percentage of the items that they found and the percentage of enemies that they killed. In order to find each item or enemy, the player must find secret areas that are hidden within the back alleys of each level. Sometimes items, and even monsters, are hiding within boxes or windows that can be destroyed.[CR]Combat[CR]Father IgnatiusBlackwardTriple StrikeStrike, Strike, StrikeTriple KickKick, Kick, KickCrescent KickStrike, Kick, KickTemple StrikeStrike, Strike, KickWindmill SlamKick, Kick, Kick, StrikeLast JudgementKick, Strike, BlockLunge KickStrike, Jump, KickHammer CurlKick, Strike, StrikeHammerhead CrushKick, Strike, JumpScottish BackhandStrike, Kick, StrikeSpin StrikeKick, Strike, Kick, StrikeCyclone Leg SweepStrike, Strike, Strike, KickWindmill SlamKick, Kick, Kick, StrikeJudas Jack KnifeKick, Jump, BlockAhab's RevengeStrike, Kick, Strike, KickHigh Kick FeintStrike, Jump, Strike, KickNadia FranciscusTriple StrikeStrike, Strike, StrikeTriple KickKick, Kick, KickSide Flip KickStrike, Strike, Jump, KickSever SlashStrike, Jump BlockGymnast StrikeKick, Up KickDivide &amp; ConquerKick, Up Kick, Strike KickBack Flip KickStrike, Strike, Strike, Kick, Up KickCrescent KickStrike, Kick, KickWuthering SliceKick, Kick, Down KickBloody BallerinaKick, Strike, Up Strike KickFeet of FuryStrike, Kick, Kick, KickCyclone VolleyKick, Kick, Kick, Strike[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]ChelseaSpitalfieldThames TunnelSewer Snake (Boss)India DocksHighgate CemetaryHampstead HeathQueenhite DocksCitySmithfieldThe Snowman (Boss)Regents CanalLondon ZooMryleboneBloomsburyPimlicoJose Manuel (Boss)Westminster IIThe Roofs (Boss)[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]ZombiesZombies[CR]These lumbering, weak undead creatures are unleashed on the player immediately, serving as the weakest creatures in the game. Unless they are properly disposed of by severing the torso, these bipedal monsters will continue to rise and attack.WerewolvesWerewolves[CR]The undead are not the only creatures roaming the streets of London, as these poor souls have been infected with lycanthropy. These part-human, part-wolf hybrids are numerous and are keen on jumping at the player from concealed locations.DemonsDemons[CR]These small, flying creatures will disguise themselves as statues early on in the game, but in later levels, they will appear as red flying creatures. Both incarnations will spit fireballs at the player as the fly about.Pepys' MonsterPepys&#8217; Monster[CR]Named after Samuel Pepys&#8217; documentations, this creature has been horribly mutated by the joining of several citizens. With three heads and three arms, these massive creatures will appear sporadically, usually behind several barrels that are thrown at the player.DockersDockers[CR]These large, blue creatures are the strongest in the game if they are able to get enough hits in. Taking several blows to kill, these monsters have a thick, rocky hide that they use to knock down walls and crush the player.RoachesRoaches[CR]The Brotherhood&#8217;s research didn&#8217;t end at just the citizens. Their horrific formula also affected the insect population, starting with the roaches that infest the sewers of London. These mutants will lunge and attack the player very quickly but are dispatched easily.Thames MonsterThames Monster[CR]Lurking in the River Thames, these creatures use several tentacles rather than eyes to find and attack the player from afar. Its round face sports only a massive maw with hundreds of teeth, should its prey get too close.HarpiesHarpies[CR]These shrieking female mutants replaced their limbs for wings and fly about in groups, waiting to swoop in on the player. Since they move at an incredible speed, they are difficult to catch up with but are much easier to kill.Spider DemonsSpider Demons[CR]Hampstead Heath has been infested by mutated spiders, which have quickly multiplied and moved into the city. Many of London&#8217;s streets are covered in their grotesque green webbing as they hunt the citizens for food.The Faceless MenThe Faceless Men[CR]These former members of the Brotherhood of Hecate have been forced to drink the horrific formula and wander the streets with the rest of the undead citizens. While they certainly look dapper and gentlemanly, they won&#8217;t hesitate to use their knife to attack the player.Giant RatsGiant Rats[CR]These mutated pests are exactly that. Rodents that roam about London have been infected and will now jump out at the player with their giant, dirty claws. Not much caution is needed, however, as they are easily killed by a slice to the torso.GargoylesGargoyles[CR]Just like the demons earlier in the game, these stone-encrusted demons will pose as statues until the player is too close, lunging at them with their massive claws. While these winged beasts never take flight, they are strong and difficult to deal with.Hell HoundsHell Hounds[CR]Introduced in the later levels, these demons spring from the burning areas of London, breathing fire at the player and attacking with quick bites and scratches. As one of the most difficult creatures in the game, these creatures do not appear very much.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]This five-headed creature rises from the sewer, terrorizing the citizens above. As the gigantic serpent breathes fire through each mouth from a distance, the only way to bring down this beast is by destroying the structures surrounding him.

		<title_clean>Ogre Battle 64 - Person of Lordly Caliber</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber is a sequel to the       SNES game       Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen released in 1993. It has many of the same gameplay mechanics as it's predecessor but boasts better graphics, more classes and a longer quest. Ogre Battle 64 is a Strategy RPG but differs from most RPGs in that the player doesn't have direct control over the combat. Instead the player directs units and the battles play out in a sequence of characters attacking one another until they run out of attacks or wipe out the other side. Like, the original, there are many choices to be made throughout the story and decide which one of the multiple ending the player gets upon beating the game.  The game can easily be over 100 hours for most players, especially with the ability to go back to previous stages and find hidden items and sub quests.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]You follow     Magnus Gallant, a fresh graduate of the military academy and new recruit of the Palatinius Army. After witnessing injustice to the lower class of Palatinus first-hand during his first few missions as a soldier, he decides to join the Revolutionary Army. Magnus and his revolutionary army then set out to liberate all of Palatinius and abolish the class system. Along the way he will fight fellow countrymen, the Lodis empire, denizens of the Netherworld, and his best friend. Depending on the choices the player makes there are three possible endings. Varying from Palatinus ending up in chaotic disorder to Magnus becoming the new king and the Golden Age of Palatinus.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are two different screens where the player has control over the game. The first is the pre-mission menu screen. Here, the player can do a number of things. Such as detailed information on characters and events to keep you updated on the huge story, a place to train you troops, and the organization of your troops. The immense amount of character classes is iconic of the    Ogre Battle franchise. There are dozens of different classes and weapons to choose from and hundreds of ways to micro-manage your troops.  The second gameplay screen is the battle screen. Once the battle has started the game takes you to an overhead view of the battlefield. Here you deploy different units from your stronghold, up to ten. Units are groups of  up to 5 soldiers on a 3x3 grid and appear as one character on the battlefield and can be commanded to move, attack, and liberate cities on the map.   When a friendly unit encounters an enemy unit, the screen switches to the battle screen. Unlike most RPG's, the player only has limited control over what happens in the battle by setting basic tactics such as attacking the enemy units leader or attacking the weakest character in the unit. The soldiers on each side take turns attacking each other, until all characters run out of attacks or one side is wiped out. The player can maximize his units efficiency by strategically placing the soldiers in the grid. If the leader of a unit is killed the unit will cease moving and simply run away from any enemy unit that approaches it unless a new leader is assigned. The player can achieve victory by liberating the enemy stronghold or by defeating all other units in a normal battle. The player loses if Magnus is killed or if their stronghold is overtaken.Ogre Battle 64 added a feature that lets the player save where they are in a map to resume to later, rather than having to play through the entire map before saving.  This was a welcome addition to most players, as the original Ogre Battle didn't have this feature, forcing players to finish maps that can take several hours to finish or else restart the mission.[CR]Rarity[CR]Ogre Battle 64 is a fairly rare game to buy used.  Not many games were produced initially, despite a good reception from critics and fans of the genre.  Even after the next gen consoles game out and right before  Gamestop stopped selling used   Nintendo 64 games, the game sold for roughly $25, while most other Nintendo 64 games sold for $0.99 to $5.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 255 of any portable Item[CR][B][I]NOTE:  To make sure this works correctly, you must have 1, and only 1 of the items to duplicate.[/I][/B] [CR][B]1.[/B]  [I]Set up a proper unit[/I]:  Build a unit that has at least one person who can only carry one item.  I normally use a unit made up of 5 wizards to do this.  Now you need to set up the items.  Make the unit use up all but the last two item slots, then add the item to duplicate to the very last spot.  It should look like this: [CR](Random Item) [CR](Random Item) [CR](Random Item) [CR](Free Spot) [CR](Item to Duplicate) [CR][B]2.[/B] [I]Remove the charcter and the item[/I]:  Ok, now, just remove one charcter (that character can only carry one item).  Now your items should look like this: [CR](Random Item) [CR](Random Item) [CR](Random Item) [CR](Item to Duplicate) [CR]Go to the carry item screen, and remove the item to duplicate.  That item should now be saying 55/01.  Leave the edit unit menu, and go to the item menu.  Now you need to sell 2 of the items.  It should look like 55/54 now.  Now sell 56 of them.  It will now say 55/98.  Leave the item menu, and exit the Orginize Screen.  Reenter the Orginzie Screen, look at the items, and it should say 00/98.

		<plot>The first blast wiped out your Space Center. In just 3 hours, the hi-tech weapons satellite will strike again... It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen. Featuring intense third-person shooting action, precision laser-sighting aiming mechanism, immense 3D environments, battle heavily-armed boss characters and 'smart' enemies, 4-player Deathmatch, along with Lethal Tag, Cube Hunt, and Quick Draw.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Enter the following combinations before the demo starts:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]Depending on how much time you take, you'll get 3 different conclusions, but it isn't just a matter of reaching the last boss in a certain time. The Gulf satellite takes roughly 2 or 3 hours to charge and fire, and there are two points in the game where if you go over that time, the satellite will fire. So, If you take over 3 hours to get to the Factory Area (stage 23), then you'll trigger the 1st scene. After that, if you take 2 or 3 more hours to get to the Control Center stage (stage 27), you'll trigger the second scene. To get the Good Ending, in which you fight Dan and Cecile, you can't trigger any of those scenes. To get the Normal Ending, in which you only fight Dan, you can only trigger one scene (doesn't matter which). To trigger the Bad Ending, in which you only fight Cecile, you have to trigger both scenes.</plot>

DescriptionLocationKoopa Bros. Fortress Acting as the game&#8217;s initial dungeon, the Koopa Bros. Fortress is, fittingly enough, the domain of the four Koopa Brothers. The building was previously occupied by several friendly Bob-ombs, but they were imprisoned in the fortress&#8217;s basement when the Koopa Bros. took over. The first Star Spirit, Eldstar, is held captive in the fortress by the Koopa Bros.Mario and Kooper in the basement of the Koopa Brothers' Fortress.Dry Dry Ruins An enormous temple that was buried for many years under the sands of Dry Dry Desert, Dry Dry Ruins is the location of the second Star Spirit, Mamar. The temple emerges from beneath the sand after Mario pinpoints its hidden location by using the tracking abilities of the &#8220;Pulse Stone.&#8221; Home to a multitude of Chain Chomps, and their master, Tutankoopa, the Dry Dry Ruins is filled with many assorted enemies, including Pokeys. It is in the Dry Dry Ruins that Mario finds the powerful upgrade to his original hammer, the Super Hammer.Mario and Parakarry navigating the Dry Dry Ruins.Gusty Gulch Located just beyond the Forever Forest and Boo Mansion, Gusty Gulch is a small, dilapidated, village that is home to several Boos, as well as a fearsome boss &#8211; the &#8220;invincible&#8221; Tubba Blubba. The Boo inhabitants of the village are being terrorized by Tubba Blubba, who has taken to eating any Boo that he crosses paths with as a means of revenge for the harassment he endured from the Boos in the past. Once Mario discovers the weakness of Tubba Blubba, and defeats him in the Windy Mill at the base of Gusty Gulch, the Star Spirit Skolar is freed from his imprisonment by the Boos.Mario and Goombario talking to a resident Boo in Gusty Gulch.Shy Guy's Toy Box A toy box that is located inside of an abandoned house in Southern Toad Town, Shy Guy&#8217;s Toy Box is home to many Shy Guys, as well as the game&#8217;s sixth party member, Watt. The Toy Box shrinks anyone who enters it, so although the box is small in a literal sense, when Mario and friends are inside the Toy Box the size of the surrounding area appears to be much larger in scale. Inside of the Toy Box is a large set of railroad tracks and a train, along with several color-coded stations placed at various locations throughout the box. Mario travels to each of these stations to complete a specific task or recover a specific item, before moving on to the next station in the line. Upon defeating the area&#8217;s boss, General Guy, the fourth Star Spirit, Muskular, will be freed from his captivity and will return to Star Haven.Mario and Watt finding their way through the Shy Guy's Toy Box.Lavalava Island Lavalava Island is an island located to the south-west of Toad Town, and is home to a large population of Yoshis, as well as a sizable volcano named Mt. Lavalava. When Mario initially reaches the island he must help some Yoshis in Yoshi Village find their missing children, who are lost somewhere in the Jade Jungle. Once the children are all found, Mario gains the support of his sixth party member, Sushie. After navigating through the Jade Jungle, Mario reaches the Mt. Lavalava volcano. With the &#8220;help&#8221; of Professor Kolorado, Mario is able to successfully find his way through the volcano and defeat the area&#8217;s boss, the Lava Piranha &#8211; a giant Piranha Plant that dwells inside the molten magma of the volcano and makes use of several fire-based attacks. Once the Lava Piranha is defeated, the fifth Star Spirit, Misstar, is freed.Mario and Goombario in the middle of Yoshi Village on Lavalava Island.Flower Fields Flower Fields is an isolated and secluded sanctuary of nature located in the northwestern corner of The Mushroom Kingdom. The area&#8217;s condition of endless sunshine is being endangered by the wicked, cloud-shaped menace Huff N. Puff (as well as his many underlings) who has been implementing a nefarious contraption known as the &#8220;Puff-Puff Machine&#8221; to create artificial cloud cover and block-out the sun. These actions are a direct threat to many of the residents of Flower Fields, including the plant-like &#8220;Bub-ulbs&#8221; and the Wise Wisterwood tree. Mario encounters his seventh party member, Lakilester, in Flower Fields. Lakilester is a Lakitu that was previously working for Huff N. Puff and who fought against Mario, but after being defeated by Mario, he elects to join forces with him. After Mario succeeds in toppling Huff N. Puff and clearing the air over Flower Fields, the sixth Star Spirit, Klevar, is rescued, and returns to join the other Star Spirits in Star Haven.Mario and Lakilester in front of the Wise Wisterwood tree in Flower Fields.Crystal PalaceCrystal Palace is located in the northeast mountains of the Mushroom Kingdom. In order to reach the Palace and free the final Star Spirit, Mario must travel through Shiver City at the base of the mountain, and then climb to the top of the mountain. After Mario defeats the boss, the Crystal King, the final Star Spirit, Kalmar, is released and joins the others in Star Haven to complete the reunion. With all seven Star Spirits restored to their full power, Mario prepares to challenge Bowser in a final showdown.Mario and Bow in Shiver City.[CR]Star Spirits[CR]DescriptionAppearanceEldstar He is the elder of the star spirits, and is the first to be rescued by Mario.

		<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]Paperboy Arcade[CR]Paperboy was released to arcades in 1984 by Atari Games. It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger Lurks[CR]Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.[CR]Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.Incarnations[CR]There have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers![CR]If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.[CR]A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.[CR]The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]At the Secret Codes screen, enter the following:</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64 that was developed and published by Rare. Released on May 22, 2000 in North America, June 30, 2000 in Europe, and October 21, 2000 in Japan, the game was met with acclaim by both fans and critics alike, despite criticism of flaws in its frame-rate. It features a long-winding story that can be played in single-player, co-operative, or the unique counter-operative modes and a "combat simulator", a fully-customizable multiplayer mode.[CR]Perfect Dark is considered the spiritual sequel to GoldenEye 007, and was originally designed as another game in the 007 franchise. But Rare figured that a new IP using a similar "secret agent" idea would be the best way to go. The game's engine is based on the one used in GoldenEye, with significant improvements. The game, however, uses modified weapons and levels from GoldenEye as an added bonus.[CR]The game required the use of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak to play (and will restrict the player to limited multiplayer gameplay when it's not found). It was one of the first games to support Dolby Surround Sound and higher-resolution graphics up to 640x480 (via the Expansion Pak), and one of the only games to support the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak. (Using it with the Game Boy Color version of Perfect Dark unlocks cheats) Originally, the Transfer Pak was also used in conjunction with the Game Boy Camera to let the player put their face (or someone else's) in the game. Dubbed PerfectFace, this idea was scrapped. Another idea which was scrapped was the ability to take hostages as human shields. However, as with the Game Boy camera idea this idea was sidelined due to it being perceived as overly violent. However, both of these ideas can be found in more modern games; face scanning in Rainbow Six Vegas and hostage taking in Gears of War.The protagonist, Joanna Dark[CR]The story takes place in the year 2023 involving espionage between two factions: Carrington Institute (a research and development center) and dataDyne Corporation (a defense contractor). The protagonist is Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute, whose high scores in training earns her the codename "Perfect Dark". The game begins as Joanna Dark is sent to investigate the dataDyne Corporation for an insider who calls himself Dr. Caroll. The plot twists through espionage, presidential politics, and eventually interstellar warfare.[CR]Two prequel games were released, one for the Game Boy Color and one for the Xbox 360. The Game Boy Color version, also named Perfect Dark, takes place a year before the events of the Nintendo 64 game, where Joanna Dark has just completed training in the Carrington Institute and is sent on her first mission to destroy an illegal dataDyne cyborg manufacturing facility in the South American jungle. The Xbox 360 prequel, Perfect Dark Zero, takes place three years before the events of the Nintendo 64 game, where Joanna Dark is a bounty hunter working for her father. Two prequel novels, Perfect Dark: Initial Vector and Perfect Dark: Second Front (written by Greg Rucka), and one prequel comic series, Perfect Dark: Janus' Tears, was released in conjunction with Perfect Dark Zero.Xbox Live ArcadeThe Xbox 360 version[CR]On March 17th, 2010, Perfect Dark was re-released for the Xbox 360 over Xbox Live Arcade as part of the platform's "Summer Block Party" promotion for 800 Microsoft Points ($10).[CR]Handled by 4J Studios, who also ported Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie to the Xbox 360, this port contains new graphics in significantly higher resolutions than those found in the original. Geometry, character models, and animation remain unchanged, however. This game runs at a constant 60 frames per second, eliminating the frame rate issues of the original.[CR]Online multiplayer has been added to this version of Perfect Dark, supporting the Combat Simulator (up to eight human players), Co-operative (up to two players), and Counter-Operative (up to two players) modes. The Combat Simulator also adds matchmaking play, either free-for-all or team-play, including a playlist specialized for classic maps with classic weapons. (Making it feel like the online version of GoldenEye 007) This port also supports leaderboards for all single-player missions.The Nintendo 64 version[CR]This game features 20 achievements for 200 gamerscore. Most of the achievements are easy, though Perfect Agent, Prime Target, and Crowned Glory are very difficult to obtain. The port also introduces its own in-game achievement system called "leaderboard crowns", which are icons that show up next to each player's name on leaderboards. These can be obtained by doing different and sometimes unconventional things in each mission on a certain difficulty. Some crowns require the player to beat the game under a certain time or circumstance while one requires the use of the Combat Simulator.[CR]This Xbox Live Arcade game also features several unlockable rewards:Gamer Picture: Joanna Dark - Unlocked by playing a split-screen multi-player match in the combat simulator.Gamer Picture: Elvis - Earned by getting game completion of 201% on the leaderboards.Avatar Award: Perfect Aim - A gray t-shirt with the perfect dark logo on it. Unlocked after killing an enemy with a headshot.Avatar Award: Top Secret - A doll prop resembling Elvis the Maian. Unlocked after completing Mr. Blonde's Revenge, Maian S.O.S., War!, or The Duel in any difficulty.Premium Dashboard Theme: Perfect Dark - Skedar - Featuring artwork of the Skedar Homeworld. Unlocked by getting a kill with every weapon available in the game, without using cheats.Multiplayer Skin: Agent 4 - Crackdown 2 character model, a Save File Unlockable, unlocked if the player has a Crackdown 2 save file on their system.[CR]The game received a title update on May 6th, 2010, focusing primarily on achievement fixes, advanced control options, and a new deathmatch-only matchmaking playlist: Hardcore. (no radar, auto-aim, or highlights) The update also made the explosions and performance of the Laptop Gun's sentry mode act similar to the original Nintendo 64 version.[CR]Solo Missions[CR]Perfect Dark contains 17 main missions and 4 bonus unlockable missions, known as "special assignments". There are no checkpoints in the middle of a level or a way to save the game, and the player must restart the level after failing. Each has a set of objectives that varies with the difficulty setting, becoming more involved as the difficulty increases. There are three difficulty settings (Agent, Secret Agent, and Perfect Agent), but a fourth setting, Perfect Dark, lets the player decide the health, damage, and accuracy of the opponents. (The mode is only available after beating all the levels on Perfect Agent). The 4 "special assignments" in the game are canonical to the story and sometimes lets the players control alternative characters. (Two of the missions require the player to be a Maian while one of the missions requires them to be a Skedar in Mr. Blonde form.)Carrington InstituteThe Carrington Institute[CR]When the game starts up, the player picks a profile and is given a menu with all the basic play options available. However, the player can back out of this menu and walk around the Carrington Institute as Joanna. The Institute is a multi-story complex with a handful of rooms to do different trainings in. The first time the player backs out to the Institute, Daniel Carrington greets Joanna and shows her around the various rooms.Firing Range - Here, weapons the player unlocks in the story mode and the combat simulator challenges can be used in individually tailored target tests. There is a bronze, silver, and gold test for each weapon and winning enough golds will unlock classic weapons from GoldenEye 007 for use in the single player missions. The computer in the range's antechamber has detailed information about each weapon.Device Room - As in most spy games, Dark has a host of gadgets she uses during her adventure. The Device Room lets Joanna try them out at her leisure.Simulation Room - This room has several beginner maneuvering exercises Joanna can complete, most improving her skills in evasion and disarming opponents.Data Room - The computer on the left side of this room has personnel information on important characters in the story. This information fills in through playing the story missions. Another computer lets the player access the cheats.Hangar - Other than a host of pointless areas (which will be important later in the game), the player can control a hovercraft and a hovering crate. The crate can be taken to the Firing Range and propped up against the door, letting them take the weapons outside of the firing range. This has been fixed in the Xbox Live Arcade port.Co-Operative Mode[CR]The missions can be played in the classic co-operative mode. Here, two players can share a split screen while they do the missions together. Only the first player, who holds all mission-critical equipment, must survive. The player can also play this in single-player with up to four AI allies, or simulants. These simulants only use one weapon and have the tactics (or lack of) of the enemy (though they can have their tactics changed from aggressive to stealthy). The player starts off playing the game with one AI, but as they beat the game in co-operative under different difficulties, they can unlock the option to add more allies to the game. (2 for Agent, 3 for Secret Agent, 4 for Perfect Agent)[CR]Using cheats, the player can change the character their simulant(s) or human partner will be portraying. Some missions, like Mr. Blonde's Revenge, will force the simulants to use the Mr. Blonde model (but their weapons will be the same as other missions).Velvet Dark - Joanna's sister and the default simulant. Always uses the default Falcon 2 pistol.Pugilist - A large man who only uses fists.Hotshot - Carries a DY357 Magnum on one hand and the DY357-LX in the other.Hit and Run - A Mr. Blonde look-alike equipped with a K7 Avenger.Alien - A Maian with a RC-P120.Counter-Operative Mode[CR]Counter-Op puts a unique spin on co-operative play. One player plays as Joanna Dark while the other player plays as a random enemy. The enemy player has the same low health as the other enemies, but takes control of another enemy after death. This mode can be exploited by a guard who understands the operative's motives (for example, when boarding Air Force One, Jo dons a disguise and cannot shoot her gun without failing the mission), so some form of non- griefing pact should be arranged before attempting this mode with a friend. Even without griefing issues, completing missions is next to impossible on anything but Agent if the Counter-Op player is a good shot--the story mode guards are not even close to as vigilant or aggressive as a human player. In regards to the enemy player, if he is low on health and feels down on his life, there's a suicide pill the player character can take to instantly kill themselves and re-spawn as a new enemy guard.[CR]Combat Simulator[CR]Perfect Dark's main multiplayer mode, also known as the Combat Simulator, features up to four players (eight in the XBOX Live Arcade Version) and eight CPU opponents (also known as "simulants"). They can split up into different teams (up to eight) indicated by color. (Team 1 and Team 2 are red and yellow, just like the primary and secondary firing mode colors) Nearly every game attribute can be modified, including one-hit kills and radar. For casual games, the player may also turn on cheats, such as Unlimited Ammo No Reloads, for extra fun.[CR]Once the player complete a matchs, their stats are tracked on their profile. These stats include kills, deaths, wins, losses and accuracy. There are 4 skill medals that they can get for each match (Accuracy, Headshot, KillMaster, and Survivor, all which are tracked in their profile) and 17 post-game awards (including Most Deadly, Shortest Life, and Most Professional). As they get more kills and win more matches, the player's profile's level increases. However, increasing levels add nothing to the game.[CR]Not every weapon, simulant type, level, and game mode is unlocked from the start. They must be unlocked by doing challenges in the Combat Simulator. (Weapons can also be obtained by using them in the single-player game) There are 30 challenges in the game, each can be played up to four human players at a time. The more players playing the challenge, the more simulants they face. Challenges start off trivially easy and later become painfully difficult. They often introduce new game modes and weapons. Only four challenges are available at the start, with each beaten challenge unlocking a new challenge.Game Modes[CR]There are six base game modes that can be played in the Combat Simulator:Combat - Traditional deathmatch.Hold the Briefcase - Unlocked after clearing 2 challenges. A briefcase item randomly spawns in the level at the beginning of the match. The player character must grab the case and stay alive. Holding the case for 30 seconds earns them a point. Once they die, they drop the briefcase, which is either picked up by an ally, an enemy, or reset to a random part of the level.Capture the Case - Unlocked after clearing 4 challenges. Traditional capture the flag. The case must be at home to score and dropped cases are automatically returned.King of the Hill - Randomly-determined areas of the map must be held uncontested for 20 seconds to earn a point. Each teammate on the hill is awarded a point when the hill's timer reaches zero. After that, the hill is moved to another random area.Hacker Central - Unlocked after clearing 6 challenges. Players must grab a data uplink item and use this item (leaving themselves defenseless) on a computer. Both the data uplink and computer spawn in a random area of the map. If the holder of the data uplink item dies, the data uplink respawns to a different area. Points are earned for each successful "hack", which lasts around 10 seconds.Pop a Cap - Unlocked after clearing 12 challenges. One random player is the "victim". If that player survives 30 seconds, he gets a point. If another player kills him, that player gets two points. Once that player survives or dies, the role of the "victim" switches to another player.Simulants[CR]Simulants in the Combat Simulator are bots that can be customized according to difficulty and specialty. Simulant teammates can be ordered by their human teammates. The difficulty for the bots include:MeatSim - Horrible, mindless bot with absolutely no accuracy.EasySim - Still going to take bullets, but has slightly better accuracy.NormalSim - The average difficulty of simulant. Average accuracy and intelligence.HardSim - Unlocked after clearing 4 challenges. HardSims begin using the radar to find the player while hunting for the best weapons.PerfectSim - Unlocked after clearing 9 challenges. A real challenge. Great accuracy and fast movement.DarkSim - Unlocked after clearing 21 challenges. This bot cheats.[CR]Simulants can also have one of many special characteristics, such as:PeaceSim - A simulant against violence, he will run around hoarding weapons (while using the unarmed disarm ability against the other players).ShieldSim - Always goes for the shield.RocketSim - Only uses explosive weapons.KazeSim - If this simulant spots the player, it will try to attack them no matter what the odds are.FistSim - Like the PeaceSim, only more dangerous with the fists.PreySim - Hunts down the easier targets.CowardSim - Will always run away unless it has a superior weapon.JudgeSim - Attacks the enemy player with the highest score.FeudSim - Makes a random decision at the start of the game to hunt down only one opponent for the entire game.SpeedSim - Speedhacker.TurtleSim - While it's very slow, it has a powerful shield.VengeSim - Hunts down the last player who killed it.Arenas[CR]There are 17 arenas in perfect dark, 3 of them which are remakes of Goldeneye 007 arenas:Area 52SkedarPipesArea 52Complex - Unlocked after clearing 1 challenge. Remake of Complex from Goldeneye 007.Warehouse - Unlocked after clearing 3 challenges.Ravine - Unlocked after clearing 5 challenges.Temple - Unlocked after clearing 6 challenges.

Apparently, a sapient named Dr. Carroll has all the details necessary to foil an upcoming plot by dataDyne's leader and his advanced coding has given him a personality and moral code that Carrington believes would make him akin to their cause. However, officials at dataDyne have realized this and are planning to erase his memory, so time is of the essence. Joanna makes her way through the office space of the dataDyne HQ, taking down guards and camera systems indiscriminately, as well as knock out dataDyne executive Cassandra de Vries for the RFID necklace she has. She continues this rampage until she reaches the basement floor, where a secret wall panel reveals an elevator down to the laboratories under the facility. Assuming Dr. Carroll must be there. She rides this elevator into the labs.DataDyne InvestigationSneaking in to rescue Dr. Carroll.[CR]Joanna's mission to capture Dr. Carroll remains the primary objective of this mission. However, as the opportunity presents itself, Carrington also gives her many secondary objectives within this most technologically advanced laboratory. The place is loaded to the brim with new weapons and technologies, such as a prototype shield system and the K7 Avenger assault rifle. Jo works her way through building, takes pictures, steals and sabotage sensitive equipment. She eventually finds Dr. Carroll in a sealed off room where he is revealed be some kind of flying laptop with eyes. Dark isn't sure what to make of this, but Dr. Carroll realizes the danger of the situation and urges her to leave immediately (with him in her care, naturally).DataDyne ExtractionLights out.[CR]By the time she reaches the elevator back up the main structure, the upper branches of dataDyne HQ have prepared for Joanna's attempted rooftop extraction. There are many blockades set up with guards waiting for her around every corner. What's more, Cassandra de Vries's personal body guards are stationed throughout the building with station, ready to take down Jo for the slap in the earlier mission. She makes her way slowly and methodically to the rooftop, dispatching all of Cassandra's personal guard and even a hovercopter in the process. When she finally gets to the helipad on the roof, Cassandra is there waiting with two more guards. She offers Joanna a chance at redemption by resigning from the Carrington Institute and coming to work for her. Jo blasts de Vries's last two guards with a shotgun and jumps back onto the aircraft.Carrington VillaJoanna's got to be quick or they'll kill the negotiator![CR]Sometime after Extraction, Joanna receives a distress call from the Institute. Apparently, Daniel Carrington is being held hostage in his private villa by dataDyne and they are questioning him about Dr. Carroll. Rather than go into the mission with their pants down the Institute team devise a plan to send a fake terms negotiator a decoy so Dark can get in as close as possible without detection (on Perfect Agent, Jo actually is the negotiator). She snipes the greeting party that comes for the negotiator and then proceeds to cleanse the area of the dataDyne presence. Their numbers are heavy, but they are unaware of her presence, so they behave in an uncoordinated fashion. After eliminating the watch outside, Jo proceeds to the basement of Daniel's chateau where he is being held. She pushes her way into his holding quarters, but she is too late. Daniel already told them where he hid Dr. Carroll. Thankfully, Daniel read into their peripheral conversations and determined that a meeting of minds was happening at the G5 building in Chicago that night. Using all the time available (not much) Jo gets ready for the trip.ChicagoBeware the Perfect Dark Robocop.[CR]The first actual stealth mission in the game, Joanna is charged with making her way into the G5 building undetected by traversing the streets of Chicago. If the guards posted at the building catch wind of her intentions, they will seal off the entrance and effectively eliminate any chance of eavesdropping on the meeting inside. Despite the short time between the two endeavors, the folks back at the Institute have an elaborate ploy already set up for her ingress. A supply drop is placed in a storm drain near the G5 car park entrance. Inside is a remote mine and reprogrammer. Jo sets the remote mine on a blocked off emergency exit at the back of G5 (its placement actually influences the course of events in the next mission) and reprograms a taxi to crash into a robocop, creating a diversion of large enough scale to draw the guards attention and give her window to sneak inside.G5 BuildingPatiently waiting for the right moment.[CR]Once inside, the objective is still far from complete. The G5 building is brimming with security and the guards on the outer layers of this protection possess a new cloaking device technology. After this initial debacle, Jo silently proceeds into a room adjacent to the conference room. She takes down any guard in the area who might sound an alarm and call off the meeting, then disable the laser grid guarding the ventilation system. From here, the CamSpy takes over and Jo sends it into the room where the talking has just started. Apparently, NSA director Trent Easton is conspiring with dataDyne and a "Mr. Blonde" to take command of a deep sea diving vessel. Unfortunately for them, Easton overestimated the President's trust in him. He claims to have a contingency plan ready to go. All he needs now "is a tissue sample." An aircraft interception device is brought up in sparse detail as well.[CR]After the meeting adjourns, Joanna still has to retrieve Dr. Carroll's personality from a vault in the building (they brought it here after invading the villa). The vault cracking goes well, but not unnoticed, and Jo is assailed by every guard from Illinois to Maine as she waits for the vault door to open. After she nabs the personality, she exfiltrates through the exit point she designated with the remote mine in the last mission and gets ready to head back home when a startling development occurs in Area 51. Dark protests the decision to go in favor of making sure of the safety of the President, but Carrington insists and thus she leaves immediately for Nevada, unknowing of exactly what has happened.Area 51 InfiltrationAs if the N64's graphics weren't jaggy enough...[CR]On the trip over, Carrington fills in the details for the excursion. An alien craft was shot down by the interceptor alluded to in the G5 meeting. The craft contained a Maian that was en route to the Carrington Institute as assistance to Daniel. The workers in the facility don't actually know what happened, but are ready to perform autopsy procedures on the discovered alien and will kill him if Jo doesn't get there in time. She begins at a desert helipad on the edge on the base where little attentive resistance is found. She first takes care of defenses and communications on the exterior of the complex, shooting the interceptor crafts parked outside and bombing the comm center. She makes her way inside through a hangar elevator, meeting heavy resistance on the other side from national guard troops armed with Dragon assault rifles. She wades through these guards to Jonathan Dark, already waiting inside the building, disguised as a guard. He lays down the second leg of the operation.Area 51 RescueThe evil floating box.[CR]Jonathan has procured a hovering box loaded with explosives. The route Joanna took into the building isn't actually connected by normal access to the autopsy lab. However, the hangar and the lab are adjacent to one another and one particular section of the wall between them is quite weak, allowing for forced entry with the use of the explosives. The crate won't last long under enemy fire, so Jo must use stealth to evade the swarming guards in the area, escorting the box carefully up two service lifts to the weakened wall section and then blow it up (from a friend to a friend: the box is an absolute pain in the ass to escort. Just throw a proxied dragon near the breach and shoot it). Once inside, there isn't a second to waste. Joanna finds the locker room where the lab technician is just getting suited up. She knocks him out after a wild goose chase and poses as him. The guard unwittingly let's her inside the main structure, but the head surgeon doesn't recognize her and cries for help. This initiates a hurried set of events where Dark takes down the guards in the outer chamber, steals a key card, and then proceeds to rescue the Maian hostage from the grips of the unwitting surgical attendees.Area 51 EscapeElvis awakens.[CR]Just as much urgency is present in the escapade as the guards elsewhere in the complex have now caught wind of the events inside the lab. What's worse, the head surgeon turns on a nerve gas security system that bombards Jo with poisonous fumes until she exits the lab. She does so as fast as she can, finds a safe place to put the hovering stretcher with the Maian in it and meets back up with Jonathan. Jonathan had been busy entertaining the guards, but now they needed to leave and the entrance the hangar where the Maian spaceship has been locked is sealed off. Jonathan rigs up an improvised oil bomb to blast a hole in the side of the hangar and the two rush as fast as they can to the Maian, who Jo resuscitates with mysterious medical device.[CR]The Maian wakes with a start, screaming in agony. The screaming dies down and the Maian introduces himself to the two as Elvis or "Protector One" if they prefer the more relevant name. They opt for Elvis. With Elvis in tow, the group then hurries to the spaceship, only to realize that it will not hold all three of them; just two. Either Jonathan or Joanna must escape on a hoverbike located nearby after opening the two main hangar doors. Who does what is left up to the player. They make their escape without further incident.Air BaseThe crossbow remains a vital asset of any super-spy even in the future.[CR]With Elvis secured, Dark refocuses her attention to the President. Trent Easton is planning to kidnap him while aboard the Air Force One. The first step to preventing this is to board Air Force One. This involves stealing a stewardess uniform from a civilian on the way into the air base. She procures a briefcase from two unaware businessmen and loads her many gadgets inside. All of her secret spy stuff (and guns) would obviously set off the alarm, so she quickly makes her way to the scanner room where she subverts the scanner, letting the case through without incident. She then proceeds down a diagonally-oriented elevator to the Air Force One hangar, where is given the option of boarding the craft from the bottom by dodging a laser grid or through the main door at the top by evading detection. The choice is the player's and it determines where Dark begins the next mission.Air Force OneThe President is in danger.[CR]First things first, equipment. Jo makes her down the kitchen area, the kitchen being directly connected to the cargo bay. This is must faster if the plane is boarded from the bottom as Jo actually starts down there. Once she acquires her effects, she makes a segue for the president's cabin to inform him, in a barrage of facts and evidence, that he is in mortal danger. Just as she convinces him, however, an alien aircraft forcefully attaches itself to Air Force One, and dataDyne soldiers pour into the main cabin. Jo escorts the President to the plane's escape pod to ensure his survival of the inevitable crash. The alien craft is detached through a combination of a timed mine and Elvis's intervention. This does not make things better and Elvis loses control of his ship in the process of shooting a tube connecting the alien craft to Air Force One. All three machines proceed to fall out of the sky.Crash SiteThat's gonna cost ya.[CR]The scene opens with Joanna picking herself up off a bank of snow. She was flung far from the Air Force One during the crash and, once she finds her bearings, hunts it down for the presidential tracker. Along the way, she finds the president's escape pod and activates the distress beacon in the hopes its signal is strong to defeat the radio interference currently jamming her own transponder. While traversing the snowy landscape, she happens across Elvis and his ship. He seem well prepared to defend himself, and so designates his ship as the rendezvous point once she finds the president.[CR]Using the president tracker found near the wreckage of Air Force One, Jo searches around in a large ice cavern, encountering both the real president and a clone of the president. The former is being held hostage by Trent who runs when Jo shoots at him. The President and Jo make it back to the surface and she leaves him in the able hands of Elvis. She goes back into the cavern to dispatch the clone and then makes the trip back up to Elvis for the last time. From there, they wait to be picked up.Pelagic IIAll's quiet at the Pelagic docking bay.[CR]With the apparent dangers now averted, Carrington orders an investigation of dataDyne's real scheme. Jo is tasked with heading to the Pelagic II's dry dock and do whatever it takes to sabotage the expedition and, if this fails, board the vessel. The dock operation proves to be a very difficult test of quick dispatchment as the entire complex is loaded with alarms and guards that are more than willing to activate them. On the way through this gauntlet, Jo deactivates the power to the facility and forces the deactivation of the autopilot and GPS navigation systems. She meets back up with Elvis in the basement where they begin preparations to board the vessel down in the Moon Lift.Deep SeaElvis continues his trend of outclassing Joanna in firepower.[CR]The craft takes the duo down to a mysterious submarine facility of a construction similar to the alien craft that attacked Air Force One. These aliens are identified as Skedar. The guards here, as in the G5 building, are armed with cloaking devices, but Dark now has a shotgun and she makes quick work of this now second-class threat. The two come upon a curiously shaped wall that Elvis identifies as an inactive teleportal. The panel to activate is located far inside a dark cavern loaded with odd door opening mechanisms. Nevertheless, once through, they enter the heart of an enormous complex that turns out to be a potentially world-ending super-weapon developed by an ancient civilization called the Cetans. Needless to say, the urgency of the mission steps up a bit from here.[CR]Jo fends off baddies as Elvis consults various mysterious panels in the hopes of reaching the nerve center of the whole apparatus as fast as possible. They eventually manage this and find one Dr. Carroll hooked up to the heart of the machine. He is not the unassuming computer he was before, having been reprogrammed, but the folks back at the Institute created a virus designed to reinstall his old personality. After some initial sputtering and fidgeting, it works and Dr. Carroll is back to is old self. He explains that he can initiate the self-destruction of the entire machine, but he would have to destroy himself in the process. Jo and Dr. Carroll say farewell to each other and Jo and Elvis get the hell out of there.Carrington InstituteThe godsmashing RC-P120[CR]All seems taken care of now, and things can finally get back to normal. Elvis and his entourage have now arrived on Earth and Daniel Carrington is ready to take them to a formal contact between Earth leaders and the Maian people. Alas, dataDyne is not so easily cast aside. An explosion goes off somewhere in the facility just before the group boards the plane. Given no choice, Joanna grabs an AR34 from a nearby guard and sets out bring the invasion obviously in progress to a halt. She first heads further down into the hangars to activate the turrets. Knowing that the influx of soldiers has been reduced, Joanna surges through the office complex, rescuing the Institute scientists being held hostage there. She makes a stop by Carrington's office to destroy some sensitive information dataDyne might have wanted to get their hands on. She also stops by the firing range where she acquires the RC-P120. Foster had been working on it to deal with dataDyne's new shielding technology, which they now employ, it works pretty well.[CR]The chain of events continues to escalate when the soldiers rig a bomb on a Skedar craft. Jo heads down to the hover-pads and disables the device whilst avoiding fire from a multitude of "Mr. Blonde"s (actually Skedars in disguise). With this pandemonium taken care of, Dark dashes back to the main hangar where the others have already boarded the airplane. She signals for them to leave without her and they no sooner out of the building than she is knocked out by Skedar right behind her.Attack ShipA Skedar just before getting it good.[CR]Our heroine wakes up inside a Skedar holding cell. Once she gets the strength to stand up, she notices that she is not alone. None other than Cassandra de Vries is in the cell with her. No matter what Cassandra's feelings toward Jo might be however, she is far more interested in getting back at the Skedar. She sacrifices herself to make a diversion for Joanna. Jo takes this opportunity to stab a Skedar guard, steal his gun, and deal with all other guards in the vicinity. She gets a signal from Elvis that they are orbiting the ship holding her captive and that she needs to lower the force-field so they can help her. She shoots up the field's controller and meets up with the Maian forces on the bridge who are actively engaged in fierce battle the attendees of the cruiser. Elvis and Joanna make their way to the star system to make some sense out of where they are going. Elvis realizes that the ship is on the way to the Skedar's home planet and urges Jo to take him to the bridge. After much confrontation, they make it and Elvis eagerly lands the ship on the planet's surface.Skedar Ruins[CR]The Maians never knew where the Skedar's home planet was located. Now armed with that information, they have an honorable quest for Jo on the surface: kill the Skedar King. Jo starts her assassination attempt on the outskirts of the planet's royal temple. She places a number of target amplifiers on pillars outside the main structure in order bring down any shielding afforded the grounds by them. Once down, Dark goes spelunking in the dimly-lit rooms of the Skedar's most holy realms. She encounters armored Skedar bearing Reapers and Slayer rocket launchers in addition to smaller Skedar that leap out of her from corners. She makes a sacrifice to the War God by placing a weapon at the Altar below the door to the Inner Sanctum and strolls inside to discover a Skedar task force in suspended animation. One-by-one, the corpses are reanimated and assault Jo, who proceeds to take them down in turn.I won![CR]Now, finally, with all obstacles finally behind her, Joanna walks into the Skedar King's main quarters. He is waiting for her in front of a large altar. Some form of shielding technology (not unlike what DataDyne was using) is protecting him and is powered by the large statue behind him. Through waves of smaller baddies and procedural destruction of the idol behind him, the Skedar King falls to Joanna itchy trigger finger. After a rather lighthearted "Yes!" from Joanna in response to the death of a major alien society's leader, the entire complex begins to crumble and Jo is caught by falling rocks. Elvis finds her later buried under the rubble and helps her out. The two make their way back to the ship and the credits roll.[CR]Special Assignments[CR]Special Assignments are bonus missions outside of the main campaign. Each one uses environments from existing levels, with new enemy placements and objectives. To unlock them:Mr. Blonde's Revenge - Complete all story missions on Agent or higher.Maian S.O.S. - Complete all story missions on Special Agent or higher.War! - Complete all story missions on Perfect Agent.The Duel - Earn at least a Bronze rating with all 32 weapons in the Carrington Institute's firing range.Mr. Blonde's Revenge[CR]A "Mr. Blonde" is sent to the DataDyne building to capture Cassandra de Vries and bring her to Skedar justice. Mr. Blonde fights through security to gain access to Cassandra's office, followed by extraction off the helipad in a Skedar ship. The coordinated assault results in Cassandra's encounter with Joanna in the Attack Ship's holding cell.Maian S.O.S.[CR]One of the Maian Protectors escapes an Area 51 lab to send out a distress signal. Though the mission is a success, the protector gets tranquilized and captured once again. Thankfully, his heroic deed reaches the Carrington Institute, who respond with Joanna Dark's rescue effort.War![CR]The war against the Skedar changes... somewhat. A Maian assault squad now leads the charge onto the Skedar home planet. Leading the planet's defense are 3 Skedar Kings (depending on the difficulty chosen). The Maians prevail and celebrate with their traditional Dance of Joy.The Duel[CR]In the Carrington Institute's combat training room, Joanna squares off against a DataDyne guard, followed by Jonathan Dark, and culminating with Trent Easton. Each encounter's difficulty is increased, and being armed with handguns means that accuracy is key. Agent Dark, of course, overcomes all of her opponents with ease.[CR]Leaderboard Crowns[CR]Introduced with the XBLA release of Perfect Dark, Leaderboard Crowns are a set of difficult challenges based around the in-game missions. They function similarly to Xbox 360 achievements, except that they are only visible in-game. An icon representing the crown will appear on the leaderboard next to the player's mission completion time to notify other players of the achievement. Though it is possible to view the list of crowns in the pause menu, the game itself does not explain the criteria for the crowns.Crown NameMissionDifficultyUnlock CriteriaNo Help NeededDataDyne Central: DefectionPerfect AgentKill fifteen enemies with the auto-aim assist turned off.Close ProximityDataDyne Research: InvestigationAgentKill three enemies with one Proxy Mine detonation.Good Enough for ClintDataDyne Central: ExtractionAgentGet eight headshots with the DY357 Magnum.Way of the AssassinCarrington Villa: Hostage OnePerfect AgentUse the sniper rifle to get five no-scope headshots.Quickly Does ItChicago: StealthAgentComplete all objectives quickly.Bow to the AudienceG5 Building: ReconaissanceAgentKill eight enemies with the wrist crossbow's "Instant Kill" setting.Rapid Radar ShutdownArea 51: InfiltrationSpecial AgentComplete Objective 1 in 60 seconds or less.Master of DisguiseArea 51: RescueSpecial AgentObtain and use the disguise in less than 1:30.Easy RiderArea 51: EscapeAgentEscape on the hoverbike within 30 seconds of mounting it.I Want to be SedatedAir Base: EspionageSpecial AgentUse the DrugSpy to sedate six enemies in less than 30 seconds.Presidential PredictionAir Force One: AntiterrorismAgentComplete Objective 3 first, and then finish the level in 1:30 or less.Magnum P.

(With the exception of the classic guns, which are primary only).[CR]For a more detailed look at the weapons, see this list.NameTypeDescriptionFalcon 2Pistol/Melee[CR]Accurate and trustworthy, this gun is the workhorse of the Institute's operations. Use the laser sight to place bullets with deadly effect, or pistol-whip adversaries to knock them out.[CR]Joanna's standard pistol. Sometimes found with silencers or scopes added. She starts with a variant of the Falcon 2 in most missions, and most enemies equip their own Falcon when disarmed. Its secondary function is a pistol whip, which is stronger than regular punching. This can be dual-wielded.Falcon 2 (with Silencer)PistolAn upgraded Falcon 2, which has the added benefit of being silent, but deadly.Falcon 2 (with Scope)PistolAn upgraded Falcon 2, featuring a 2x magnification scope which allows the wielder to take advantage of the Falcon's superiorMagSec 4PistolNot as accurate as the Falcon 2, but more powerful. Secondary firing mode is a deadly three-round burst. This can also be dual-wielded.MaulerPistol[CR]If Joanna sees a Skedar coming at her, the chances are it's carrying one of these. A large magazine and a bladed barrel make the pistol a formidable handgun, but the killer blow comes from the secondary function - charge the shot up for extra power at the cost of a few rounds of ammo.[CR]Skedar handgun. Its secondary function is a very powerful charged shot, which is one of the best attacks in the game. Can be dual-wielded.PhoenixPistol/Explosive[CR]The Maian standard issue sidearm. A flexible gun, the pistol fires standard shots, or explosive shots at no cost of the rest of the magazine.[CR]Maian pistol. Its primary function shoots small lasers while its secondary function shoots shells that explode upon impact. Can be dual-wielded.DY357 MagnumPistol/MeleeThis magnum deals great damage, but its firing rate is ridiculously slow. Secondary function is the same as the Falcon 2. A rare variant of this magnum is the gold-plated DY357-LX, also known as Trent's Magnum, which insta-kills most enemies. (Similar to the Golden Gun in Goldeneye 007) Both variants can be dual-wielded.CMP 150SMGA common sub-machine gun Joanna will find early in the game. It's accurate, quiet, and quick-firing. The secondary function locks on to enemies. Can be dual-wielded.CycloneSMG[CR]Designed for use by bodyguards, the cyclone has been adopted by presidential security due to its excellent capability when used for suppression. In extreme circumstances, it can more than double the fire rate, discharging the magazine in a second. Average fire rate: 900 RPM. Unloads at 2000 RPM.[CR]An uncommon sub-machine gun. Its secondary function discharges the current magazine of the gun in a continuous, inaccurate blast. Can also be dual-wielded.Callisto NTGSMG/Assault Rifle[CR]Another example of excellent Maian firearm design. It can fire standard shots as fast as any other SMG, or it can fire high velocity rounds which will easily penetrate objects to find targets hiding in cover. The only drawbacks with the secondary fire mode are that the fire rate is lower and accuracy suffers from the power of the shot. Average fire rate: 900 RPM. (S/F:300 RPM).[CR]Maian rifle. Secondary firing mode trades the high fire rate for high impact shells.RCP-120SMG[CR]The Carrington Institute's secret weapon. It fires at a phenomenal rate and has a huge magazine capacity. The secondary mode is a cloaking device that runs off the ammunition in the magazine. A devastating weapon. Average fire rate: 1100 RPM.[CR]A tribute to the RC-P90 from Goldeneye. An experimental assault rifle with a huge magazine size, decent accuracy and damage, and a fast reload speed. The ammo can also power a prototype cloaking device via the secondary function. One of the most powerful weapons in the game.Laptop GunSMG/Automated Sentry[CR]A submachine gun made to look like a laptop PC. In disguised form, the gun cannot fire, but when activated, it unfolds into shape. The PC gun will not bear close inspection; it will boot up, but the memory is a quarter of what it is supposed to be. Average fire rate: 1000 RPM.[CR]This laptop-turned-rifle can be a powerful alternative to the CMP150 (since it uses the same ammo type without eating that much ammo), but it shines in its secondary function. When the secondary function is activated, it deploys as a sentry gun when thrown. The sentry gun only uses how much ammo is in the current magazine.DragonAssault Rifle/Explosive[CR]A standard assault rifle with an evil twist - when the secondary mode is activated, it becomes a proximity-activated mine that looks like a gun. Average fire rate: 700 RPM.[CR]Decent assault rifle. Use the secondary function to throw the weapon on the ground, where it becomes a proximity explosive. (Much like a proximity mine)K7 AvengerAssault Rifle[CR]Another piece of high-tech kit from DataDyne. Ordinarily an assault rifle with a smallish magazine and a powerful punch, it has a threat detection mode that highlights explosives, wallguns, and similar hazards. Average fire rate: 950 RPM.[CR]Faster firing rate than the AR34 (for better or for worse) and great accuracy. Secondary function is a threat detector, which detects mines and other explosive objects.AR34Assault Rifle[CR]The Carrington Institute's main assault rifle. A good range and magazine size make it a useful weapon; the secondary mode enables the user to move while zoomed in on a target. Average fire rate: 750 RPM.[CR]Decent assault rifle. Secondary function lets the user run around while looking through the scope.Super DragonAssault Rifle/Explosive[CR]A variant of the Dragon assault rifle - instead of the proximity explosive, it has a small grenade launcher. Excellent support weapon. Average fire rate: 700 RPM.[CR]Just like the Dragon, only it removes the proximity explosive function and adds a powerful grenade launcher as the secondary function.ShotgunShotgun[CR]A DataDyne weapon manufactured for security forces. A nine-cartridge magazine combined with single or double fire modes make it a dangerous close-quarters weapon.[CR]The classic shotgun. It's powerful, despite its long reload time. Secondary firing mode fires two shots in quick succession.ReaperMachine Gun/Melee[CR]A truly terrifying weapon in the hands of someone strong enough to control the massive recoil; for anyone else, a highly unwieldy but effective corridor clearance weapon. This weapon most likely resembles a Gatling gun. Maximum fire rate: 1800 RPM.[CR]Skedar chaingun. Highly inaccurate (can be improved by crouching) with a high fire rate and high clip size. Secondary function spins the Reaper blades as a deadly melee weapon.Sniper RifleSniper Rifle[CR]With a powerful zoom and a high velocity bullet, this Carrington Institute weapon is one the best sniper rifles ever made. Crouch down for perfect accuracy.[CR]Quiet, powerful sniper rifle. Because the special long-ranged scope requires crouching, the secondary function toggles crouching.Farsight XR-20Rail Gun[CR]The Farsight rifle is a maian hybrid of an X-ray scanning device coupled with a rifle that can shoot through solid objects. The scope can lock onto and track life sources, though the device does not pan as fast as a running enemy can move.[CR]Multiplayer veterans will definitely remember this wallhacking Maian sniper rifle. Zooming with this rifle triggers the X-Ray Scan automatically, while firing will fire through walls. (no matter how many walls are in front of the enemy) Its secondary function is a target locator, which slowly moves the aim towards the player closest to the crosshair. (while zoomed)DevastatorExplosive[CR]A long range grenade delivery system manufactured by dataDyne. The secondary fire mode uses a magnetic field around the grenade to stick to surfaces, then reverses the magnetic field to drop off, exploding on impact.[CR]Powerful grenade launcher. The secondary firing mode, also known as the "wall hugger", will stick to any wall for 2-3 seconds, then release and explode on the ground.Rocket LauncherExplosive[CR]A cumbersome weapon; fires either a standard rocket or a slower, homing rocket when locked on to the unfortunate target.[CR]Traditional and very powerful rocket launcher. Its secondary firing mode locks on to the player, then fires a very slow homing rocket.SlayerExplosive[CR]The Skedar enjoy seeing the terror of their enemies. It seems natural that they should have a remote-controlled rocket as a secondary fire mode on their basic rocket launcher, so they can take pleasure from the prey's vain attempt to escape the closing projectile.[CR]Skedar rocket launcher. Its secondary firing mode is a fly-by-wire rocket, which is directly controlled by the player at the cost of his/her defense.Combat KnifeMelee/Projectile[CR]A large and vicious combat knife. It contains a vial of poison that shatters when thrown, giving a wounded enemy at most 6 seconds to live. A dataDyne weapon through and through.[CR]Combines both the Hunting Knife and the Throwing Knife from Goldeneye as primary and secondary functions.CrossbowProjectile[CR]This crossbow is a short-range 'pistol' sized example, mounted on a Carrington Institute Agent's wrist. It folds up to aid concealment and can fire up to five bolts, either the more usual drugged shots, or a lethal bolt.[CR]Its primary firing mode fires a drugged shot, knocking enemies out or making their vision blurry. Its secondary firing mode is instant kill.TranquilizerProjectile/Melee[CR]A rapid-fire device, it can be used as a weapon in an emergency, but it is designed primarily as a dermal spray injector for sedative drugs. Users are advised that a full discharge of the drug reservoir can be fatal.[CR]A tranquilizer gun. The primary sedate feature is the same as a drugged arrow in the crossbow, only it makes their vision even more blurry. Its secondary firing mode trades 4 sedatives for a lethal injection, which is a melee attack.LaserLaser[CR]The Laser is wrist-mounted and deadly accurate. It can either fire long-range pulses, or it can sustain a constant, concentrated stream of energy at short ranges.[CR]A wrist-mounted laser gun. While sometimes being hard to fire, it has infinite ammo. Its primary firing mode fires short, deadly bursts while its secondary firing mode fires a smaller continuous beam.GrenadeExplosive[CR]An updated version of the trusty grenade. Can be thrown with a four-second fuse or used as a bouncing proximity bomb.[CR]Pull the pin and throw. Its secondary function, also known as "proximity pinball", bounces off walls while becoming similar to a proximity mine.Timed MineExplosive[CR]A mine with a short timed fuse. It has a threat detection/evaluation sensor that can be activated a secondary mode.[CR]Sticks to walls and explodes after four seconds. Its secondary function is a threat detector similar to the K7 Avenger, though mines can't be thrown while the detector is on. This mine is yellow.Proximity MineExplosive[CR]A mine with a proximity fuse. It has a threat detection/evaluation sensor that can be activated as a secondary mode.[CR]Similar to the timed mine, only it explodes when an enemy (or an ally, or the player) approaches it. This mine is green.Remote MineExplosive[CR]A mine that can be triggered remotely. The activate command is the secondary mode.[CR]Similar to the timed mine, only it must be detonated manually. The detonationUnarmedMeleePunching the enemy will not only do damage, but blur their vision. Secondary function will disarm most enemies, forcing them to drop their weapons. It can then be picked up by the player.Classic WeaponsNameDescriptionPP9iThe PP7 in Goldeneye.CC13The DD44 Dostovei in Goldeneye.KLO1313The Klobb in Goldeneye.KF7 SpecialThe KF7 Soviet in Goldeneye.ZZT (9mm)The ZMG (9mm) in Goldeneye.DMCThe D5K Deutsche in Goldeneye.AR53The AR33 in Goldeneye.RC-P45The RC-P90 in Goldeneye.[CR]Gadgets[CR]NameDescriptionData UplinkProvides a link from the field agent to the Institute hackers back at HQ, who can than download data or crack electronic locks remotely.ECM MineEmits a constant shifting signal designed to jam any electronic communications device.

		<title_clean>Pilotwings 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pilotwings 64 is a sequel to the Super Nintendo game Pilotwings. This installment in the franchise continues the flight simulator themes with arcade style gameplay. Flight missions are given on four different stages, with the player able to choose from six different characters. Three different vehicles are also available for standard missions; the Hang Glider, Rocket Belt and Gyrocopter.[CR]Mission Structure[CR]Specific mission goals depend on the class of vehicle, however most missions follow the formula of takeoff, task completion and proper landing. Tasks vary from flying through a series of floating rings, to landing on checkpoints, and to taking judged pictures. Missions are also usually based on a time limit, where points are detracted once the player exceeds the time allotted.[CR]For each mission, 100 points are possible for a Perfect Score from the player. Badges are awarded for obtaining certain point levels, as in a Silver Badge is awarded for the Rocket Belt after passing an average of 80 points or higher on each Rocket Belt mission.[CR]When landing is required, the player is judged on impact and accuracy. Too hard of an impact anywhere in the level will cause the pilot to crash the plane and the mission to be failed. After each failure, the game offers textual tips for improving the player&#8217;s piloting skills.[CR]Each level of difficulty for the classes of vehicles is designated to a specific island, all four of which display unique traits. The player is also free to choose any character at any given time, which are separated into light, medium, and heavy pilots.[CR]Pilots[CR]The pilots&#8217; names are taken from bird names in the American version of the game. The lightweight pilots are Kiwi, the girl, and Lark, the boy. These are ideal for the Rocket Belt, as they display an increased maneuverability and speed. The medium weight pilots are Ibis, the woman, and Goose, the man, both of which are suited for the Hang Glider. The heaviest pilots, the woman Robin, and Hawk, the male, are best fitted for the Gyrocopter.[CR]Vehicle Classes[CR]The analog stick controls the Hang Glider&#8217;s movement, while an additional button can flare the glider&#8217;s wings for speed adjustments. Pilots must ensure they stay in the air long enough to complete the tasks while also landing properly. Hot air columns allow the Hang Glider to receive a significant amount of lift. Photography is also designated to Hang Glider missions, with each photo being stored in the photo album.[CR]The Rocket Belts are more complicated than the Hang Gliders, allowing the player to control a jet pack that sends the player hovering at high altitudes and high speeds. Two buttons are designated to different amounts of thrust, one at full engine power, and the other at half. Hovering is also possible by the trigger button, allowing precise pilot movement, proving the Rocket Belt to be a favorite among many players.[CR]The Gyrocopter takes off and lands similar to an airplane, with in flight controls responding similarly. Extremely low speeds are possible due to the helicopter fashioned design, but high speeds are also easily attainable during timed missions. The Gyrocopter is also equipped with a missile launcher while players have access to an unending supply of missiles. These are often used to either hit practice targets, or defeat the only enemy in the game, the Godzilla-like &#8220;Meca Hawk.&#8221;[CR]Additional Modes[CR]The Birdman mode equips pilots with bird-like wings attached to their arms. During these stages, the player is free to explore the island at their leisure, as this is not a timed mission, nor are there any tasks. The different weather modes are also available, ranging in sunny, cloudy, evening and night.[CR]Sky Diving is also another mode where the pilots must complete in air formations with a following parachute landing on specific targets. The player only has a limited amount of time to complete each formation, as the altitude drops rapidly during the freefall.[CR]A Cannonball mode lets players aim their pilot in a giant canon, and shoot them out towards a target, similarly to a circus clown as the missions&#8217; soundtrack suggests.[CR]The Jumble Hopper fits the pilots with oversized boots, propelling the pilot vertical and forward with force, as the goal is to reach the destination in as few hops as possible. Landing in river water will not cause the player to crash, however, points will be deducted from the final score.[CR]Locations[CR]Holiday Island is the starting location for each class of vehicle. This island is the smallest in the game, featuring attractions such as an amusement park complete with a Ferris wheel, and a mountaintop mansion.[CR]Crescent Island features a beach location, as well as an extensive cave system cutting through its main mountain ridge. Many coastal homes can be seen on the outskirts of the island, while the inside features resorts, complete with pools and tennis courts. Luxury liners also inhabit the waters nearby.[CR]Ever-Frost Island is an island permanently covered in snow, featuring tall peaks and sharp vertical drops. An oil refinery sits between some of the small islets, while a ski resort is build upon the main island.[CR]The Little States is a miniature replica of the United States, with a shrunken Mississippi River, Grand Canyon, and Rocky Mountain region. Major cities are represented as small groupings of skyscrapers, while some national monuments, such as the Washington Monument, or Mount Rushmore, exist in smaller scale. Mount Rushmore, in fact, features the likeness of Mario next to the American presidents.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Pokemon Puzzle League</title_clean>
		<plot>Description[CR]Discover the most frantic, frenzied, fun-filled Pok&#233;mon challenge ever--Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League! Line up three or more blocks of the same type to clear them off the screen. Create chains and combos to send garbage to your opponent. Collect badges from other Pok&#233;mon trainers to earn the right to enter the ultimate competition... a battle against the mysterious Puzzle Master![CR][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League features the same gameplay as in Panel de Pon. The objective is to clear blocks from the playfield by arranging them in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. A continuous stream of new blocks pushes up from the bottom of the playfield, causing the entire playfield to rise continuously. If the blocks reach the top of the playfield, the player loses. The player can temporarily stop the progression of blocks by scoring combos and chains, and in two-player battles, these actions also cause garbage blocks to stack on top of the opponent's playfield.[CR]Unlike its predecessors, Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League features a 3D mode in addition to the traditional 2D mode. In this mode, gameplay takes place on a cylinder with an effective width of 18 blocks, compared to the six-block width of the flat 2D field. It also features the original block design from Panel de Pon and Tetris Attack, as well as a Pok&#233;mon-oriented design (which is selected by default).[CR]In two-player games, players can select one of fourteen Pok&#233;mon trainers to play as. Unlike most Pok&#233;mon games, trainer and Pok&#233;mon selection are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay whatsoever.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The characters in Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League either come from the anime and were once exclusive to it, like Ash Ketchum, Tracey Sketchit, and Gary Oak or have appeared in previous Pok&#233;mon games but appear in the game as they do in the anime like Misty, Brock, and Giovanni. There are 16 playable characters in the game. In the 1P Stadium, only Ash is playable and Gary's Pok&#233;mon, Nidoran?, Growlithe, and Krabby, will fully be evolved into Nidoqueen, Arcanine, and Kingler, respectively, in Hard mode, Very Hard mode, and Super Hard mode when challenging him the second time. These fully evolved Pok&#233;mon are not playable with Gary.[CR][CR]Featured Gameplay Modes[CR][CR]1P Stadium[CR]This is the main story-based mode of the game. The player takes on the role of Ash and plays through a linear tournament against other Pok&#233;mon trainers to become the Pok&#233;mon Puzzle Master. Each round is played against a computer opponent in a single Versus round, in which scoring combos and chains sends garbage blocks to the opponent's playfield. The player may choose from one of five difficulty levels before starting the tournament.[CR]Spa Service[CR]Team Rocket steals the player's Pok&#233;mon, forcing the player to play through a series of stages in which the members of Team Rocket put on various disguises. Each stage requires the player to clear blocks down to a predetermined "clear line" - the player passes a stage when there are no blocks above the line. The player also encounters two stages in which the goal is to score combos and chains to defeat an opponent. The first of these stages takes place against "Team Rocket 2" (Butch and Cassidy), and is optional (losing does not affect the outcome of the game). The final stage takes place against Giovanni, and the player must pass this stage to win.[CR]Stages start in 2D mode, but eventually switch to 3D about halfway through the game. Spa Service Mode is equivalent to Story Mode in Panel de Pon.[CR]Time Zone[CR]The player plays on a single 2D or 3D playfield for two minutes and attempts to score as many points as possible.[CR]2P Stadium[CR]This mode allows two players to play against one another in three competitive games. 2P Versus Mode plays identically to 1P Stadium - the objective is for one player to cause the other to lose by filling their playfield. Each player can send garbage blocks to the other's playfield by scoring combos and chains.[CR]Players can also play in Spa Service Mode, in which the objective is to clear blocks down to the clear line before the other player does, or Time Zone Mode, in which the objective is to score more points than the other player in two minutes.[CR]All two-player modes can be played in 2D and 3D, and each player chooses a trainer to play as. By default, games are played in best-of-5 matches, though this can be changed in the Options menu.[CR]Marathon[CR]The player plays in either 2D or 3D mode, chooses an overall difficulty level and a starting speed level, and plays for as long as possible, scoring as many points as possible. This is equivalent to "Endless Mode" in Panel de Pon.[CR] Puzzle University[CR]This mode presents the player with a series of puzzles in which the player must clear all the blocks in a predetermined number of moves. There are multiple classes of puzzles, spanning simple "switch the correct blocks" puzzles, to chain puzzles where timing is important, as well as 3D puzzles. Once all the puzzles in the main mode have been completed, the player can access a second set of more difficult puzzles by entering a code on the controller. This is equivalent to "Puzzle Mode" in the Game Boy version of Tetris Attack; however, Puzzle University also provides a puzzle editor, in which the player can create and play their own 2D puzzles, while the Game Boy version of Tetris Attack never did have that feature.[CR]Professor Oak's Lab[CR]Contains several non-interactive tutorials describing both basic and advanced techniques.[CR]Mimic Mansion[CR]Hosted by Tracey Sketchit, this area also contains a number of tutorials showing various techniques. Unlike Oak's Lab, techniques are broken up into several categories and many skill levels, from beginner to advanced, and can be presented both non-interactively and interactively. In Interactive mode, Tracey first shows the player a set of moves, then has the player repeat those moves to achieve the same end.[CR]Mimic Mansion also provides a "Super Easy" gameplay mode which plays identically to Marathon Mode, except that gameplay is overall much slower than normal, and the speed level never increases beyond 1. Scores are not stored from this mode.[CR]Pok&#233;mon Center[CR]This section provides access to player records, trainer profiles, and game options.[CR][CR]Development[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Background music for this game is based on the Pok&#233;mon 2BA Master CD, and the song "Catch Me if You Can" from Pok&#233;mon: The First Movie's short feature Pikachu's Vacation (as well as the score for the movie itself). Some music also comes from the anime.[CR] Graphics[CR]The cutscene graphics match the animation of the anime. This game was also known for being one of the few N64 games to have FMVs, and the only one to have crisp, clear, full screen, VHS-quality FMVs, with the only quality suffering being framerate (other games featuring FMVs, such as Resident Evil 2 and Wheel of Fortune, had the videos shown either in tiny boxes in the corner of the screen or in widescreen format, and the quality was usually very grainy).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]While regarded by many as purely a system port with a renovated Pok&#233;mon scheme, improvements in technology from previous consoles to the Nintendo 64 drastically changed the single and multiplayer experiences. The immediate upgrade in pure processing power allows players to navigate between blocks much faster, leading to elite play both on the console as well as on computer emulators where users can take advantage of a much speedier keyboard. Though never massively widespread, the emulators led to high level online play when there was no such online support for the console.[CR]In addition, the Nintendo 64's more powerful processor allowed for a much more sophisticated computer AI for the 1P Stadium mode. This AI combined the faster navigation with such complex attack and defense routines that developers added not just one, but two extra difficulty levels for advanced players. There is one notable absence however, and that is the lack of play against a computer player in 3D mode for 1P stadium. If a player wants to face a computer player in 3D mode, they must do so by changing the second player to a computer one via the options mode, so that in the 2P stadium mode, the opponent faced will be CPU. Note that all selections usually made by the second player, such as character selection will still have to be entered via the second controller. This is great for practicing against level 10 computer players. The player can then select to face the computer in 3D mode if they wish. However, when facing the computer in any 3D mode, the AI becomes erratic, and usually self defeats. There is a small note in the instruction manual explaining the lack of AI for 3D mode. Its engine was later used in the Nintendo Puzzle Collection version of Panel de Pon.[CR][CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/913924-pokemon-puzzle-league[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_League[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Increased Difficulty Modes[CR]To open up V-Hard mode, go to One-Player Stadium and to the difficulty selection screen.

		<plot>Description[CR]The Professor has asked you to capture the Wild Pokemon of Pok&#233;mon island...on film! Tour the island in your ZERO-ONE vehicle and snap pictures of Pok&#233;mon in their natural habitat. Wild Pok&#233;mon are often camera-shy, so you'll have to use special items to bring them out in the open. Only the best shots will do for the Professor's Pok&#233;mon Report, so sharpen your photography skills and get ready to SNAP![CR][CR]Todd Snap (???, Tooru?), a Pok&#233;mon photographer, is summoned by Professor Oak to an unusual island to help him with a report. Oak needs quality pictures to accompany his scientific findings, and knows from past experience that Todd is the right person for the job. Pok&#233;mon Island, which contains a variety of climatic and geographic regions, is a place where Pok&#233;mon live relatively undisturbed by humans. Using a motorized, amphibious buggy named the Zero-One, Todd explores the island and takes photographs of the wide variety of Pok&#233;mon that inhabit its environments.[CR]From Professor Oak's research hub, the player can select between the game's levels and features using a menu system. The path through the levels is linear, similar to a rail shooter. Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit to a course. After completing a course, the player selects their best picture of each Pok&#233;mon to be rated by Professor Oak and added to the Pok&#233;mon Report. Scoring takes into account various aspects of the pictures, such as the Pok&#233;mon's size, its pose, and keeping the Pok&#233;mon in frame. Extra points are awarded for capturing a "special" pose or Pok&#233;mon, such as a surfing Pikachu, and if there are multiples of the same Pok&#233;mon within the frame. Scoring well in the Pok&#233;mon Report and photographing a wide variety of Pok&#233;mon is required to make progress in the game.[CR]The game features seven levels: Beach, Tunnel, Volcano, River, Cave, Valley, and the special course "Rainbow Cloud." However, the staggered acquisition of items from Professor Oak ensures that the player must re-explore the courses to discover new material. Levels must be replayed in order to locate hidden Pok&#233;mon, alternate routes, or photographic opportunities that yield the best scores. It also features a number of special items used to obtain better photographs. Players start out with an apple projectile; this is thrown to either stun Pok&#233;mon or attract Pok&#233;mon. As they progress, they obtain new items. Next, they gain an item called "Pester Balls", which are able to knock out Pok&#233;mon or flush them out of hiding. The Pok&#233;-Flute item is used for a variety of ways, such as awakening, irritating, or hatching Pok&#233;mon. It can cause Pok&#233;mon to dance, and it can play three different songs, resulting in different dances from certain Pok&#233;mon. The final item obtained is the Dash Engine, allowing players to go faster than normal. The game also features an "Album mark" where players can mark their favorite pictures to view at a later date or show to friends.[CR][CR]Development and release[CR]Pok&#233;mon Snap was originally revealed as a Nintendo 64DD game.[1] It was developed by HAL Laboratory and Pax Softnica, and published by Nintendo. It was The game features 63 of the original generation of 151 Pok&#233;mon. It was released on March 21, 1999 in Japan, and June 30 and September 15 in North America and PAL regions, both in 1999. The Virtual Console re-release of Pok&#233;mon Snap, lacking the same hardware of the Nintendo 64, replaced it with the ability to save photos to players' Wiis and sharing them with friends. It was released on December 4, 10, and 11, all in 2007, in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively.[CR]The title did not start development as a Pok&#233;mon product, but the developers felt it lacked a motivation for the players to take photos, which led to the idea of incorporating Pok&#233;mon[CR][CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/198311-pokemon-snap[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Description[CR]At long last, all of your favorite Pok&#233;mon are rady to go head-to-head on the N64&#174;! Whether you're battle a friend, a Gym Leader or a tournament contestant, you're about to witness some of the most spectacular battle scenes in Pok&#233;mon history! Select a team from a huge stable of "rental" battlers, or use the included N64 Transfer Pak&#153; to upload your own team from Pok&#233;mon Red, Blue or Yellow! This Stadium is packed and ready to rock![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Pok&#233;mon Stadium does not have a storyline. Progress in the game can only be made by winning "Cups" in the Stadium and completing the Gym Leader Castle. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle completed, Mewtwo will appear in the sky over the Stadium. Defeating Mewtwo will unlock Round 2, in which the player must re-challenge the Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and Mewtwo in order to complete the game.[CR][CR]Stadium[CR]Pok&#233;mon tournaments take place in the Stadium. There are four Cups to participate in. Players choose a team of six Pok&#233;mon, in any combination of pregenerated rental Pok&#233;mon and Pok&#233;mon imported from a Game Boy cartridge. Each round consists of eight three-on-three battles, and the Pok&#233; and Prime Cups consist of four rounds, named after Pok&#233; Balls (Pok&#233; Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, Master Ball), that must be cleared to win that Cup.[CR]    * Pika Cup: Battle using Pok&#233;mon from levels 15 to 20.[CR]    * Petit Cup: Battle using Basic Pok&#233;mon from levels 25 to 30 who fall under a certain height and weight. The most restrictive Cup.[CR]    * Pok&#233; Cup: Battle using Pok&#233;mon from levels 50 to 55.[CR]    * Prime Cup: Battle using Pok&#233;mon of any level. All opponents' Pok&#233;mon are at level 100.[CR][CR]Gym Leader Castle[CR]The player can challenge the eight Kanto Gym Leaders from the Game Boy games, as well as the Elite Four and the Champion (Rival). However, one must defeat three trainers before battling a Gym Leader. Each time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of eight randomly selected prize Pok&#233;mon will be awarded, which can be transferred to the player's Pok&#233;mon Red, Blue, or Yellow game using the Transfer Pak. The prize Pok&#233;mon are Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Eevee, Kabuto, and Omanyte.[CR][CR]Versions[CR][CR]First (Japan only)[CR]The original title, called Pok&#233;mon Stadium (?????????, Pokemon Sutajiamu?), was released in Japan on August 1, 1998. This version featured only 42 Pok&#233;mon available for battle, instead of the full 151 Pok&#233;mon from the Game Boy versions. The remaining Pok&#233;mon were viewable in a Pok&#233;dex, but the models lacked the required animations for battle. This version was not released outside of Japan, and as such the numbering of subsequent Japanese releases is ahead of the North America releases. This game was originally intended for the Nintendo 64DD format, but as the Nintendo 64DD was a commercial failure, Pok&#233;mon Stadium transferred to cartridge format. There was also a Pocket Monsters Stadium Expansion Disk proposed as an add-on for the Nintendo 64DD but was unreleased.[CR]The first game had met widespread criticism for its difficulty, and in Pok&#233;mon Stadium 2 the AI was toned down to make it easier for average players to beat.[CR]Second (first outside of Japan)[CR]The second game was called Pok&#233;mon Stadium 2 (?????????2, Pokemon Sutajiamu Tsu?) in Japan and was released as Pok&#233;mon Stadium in North America. This version features all 151 original Pok&#233;mon from the original Game Boy games. The North American version of this game featured support for transferring Pok&#233;mon from Pok&#233;mon Red, Blue, and Yellow via the N64 Transfer Pak.[CR]The North American version could also be purchased in a bundle that included the game with Transfer Pak, a Nintendo 64 with a gray controller, a second purple controller, the Pok&#233;mon Stadium Official Strategy Guide by Prima Games, and a "Cool Porygon" trading card.[CR][CR]Optional features[CR]Pok&#233;mon Stadium has many features aside from the main battling sequence, such as mini-games and a Game Boy player on the Nintendo 64.[CR]In Free Battle mode, players may conduct practice battles. Players can select rules from any of the tournament cups, or use modified rules. Up to four players may participate, using any combination of rental Pok&#233;mon and those imported from cartridges plugged into a Transfer Pak.[CR]At the GB Tower, the player can play Pok&#233;mon Red, Blue, or Yellow on the Nintendo 64. Winning tournament cups in the Stadium will eventually unlock Doduo Mode (double speed) and Dodrio Mode (triple speed).[CR]Victory Palace contains statues of Pok&#233;mon who have beaten the Elite Four in Gym Leader Castle or completed the highest round of a tournament in the Stadium.[CR]Battle Now! is a battle arena for a quick battle with one or two players.[CR]In an Event Battle, two players with Transfer Paks plugged in can use Pok&#233;mon from their Game Boy games and battle with custom rules.[CR]Gallery is where you can snap photos of your Pok&#233;mon to be printed at a Pok&#233;mon Snap Station.[CR]The Pok&#233;mon Lab is only accessible if a Game Boy cartridge is plugged into the Transfer Pak. If the game is saved in a Pok&#233;mon Center, the player may access the PC and can arrange boxed Pok&#233;mon and items. The Lab also features an interactive Pok&#233;dex and a machine for trading between two cartridges connected by Transfer Pak. Players cannot, however, transfer rental Pok&#233;mon from Pok&#233;mon Stadium. Certain Pok&#233;mon, such as Mew, could only be obtained at a Nintendo Promotional Event using a Transfer Pak; a rental Mew could be obtained in an event, but, as previously stated, cannot be transferred to Pok&#233;mon Red, Blue, and Yellow.[CR]Kids Club is an area where nine Pok&#233;mon themed mini-games can be played, either as stand-alone games or as part of a tournament. One to four human players may participate, with the remaining players controlled by the computer. Many of the games utilize button mashing. A higher difficulty level could be obtained by beating the CPUs five times in a row on hard [CR][CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Stadium[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/198312-pokemon-stadium[CR]</plot>

"Pok&#233;mon Stadium Gold Silver") in Japan, is a video game for the Nintendo 64. It features all 251 Pok&#233;mon from the first and second generations. It was released in North America as simply Pok&#233;mon Stadium 2, as it was the second Stadium game to be released there. In Japan, Pok&#233;mon Stadium Kin Gin was the third game of the Pok&#233;mon Stadium series. The Japanese edition also featured the capability to use the Pok&#233;mon Mobile System from Pok&#233;mon Crystal which was also released on the same day.[CR]This game featured support for all three original Game Boy Pok&#233;mon games (Pok&#233;mon Red, Blue, and Yellow) and the three Game Boy Color games (Pok&#233;mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal). As in the previous Stadium games, Pikachu from Yellow was a hidden character if the game cartridge was connected. The majority of the game takes place inside the new location White City, where various facilities for battling, organizing, researching, and playing with Pok&#233;mon are located. This can be considered to be the Pok&#233;mon League for the second generation games.

		<title_clean>Power Rangers - Lightspeed Rescue</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue was developed by many different companies and published by THQ. Each version was completely different and offered many different play styles.[CR]Playstation Version[CR]The Pink Ranger drop kicks an enemy in the PSX version.[CR]The Playstation version was developed by Climax and published by THQ. It was released October 30, 2000.[CR]It's a standard top down 3D beat em' up where the player can play as all 5 Rangers and, once unlocked, the Titanium Ranger. Each Ranger has his or her own special attack along with the standard assortment of punches and kicks. Not much can be said about the gameplay except the Rangers fight their way to the end of the level and beat a boss. This version of the game can be played co-op.[CR]N64 Version[CR]The N64 version was developed by Mass Media and was also published by THQ. It was released September 28, 2000.Top down shooting level.[CR]This version was wildly different from the Playstation version. Instead of it being a top down beat em' up it had four different gameplay types that play like minigames. One type is a top down shooter where a Power Ranger is the playable character, the A button is used to shoot forward and the B button to shoot behind. The player moves around the area collecting coins or saving hostages. The second gameplay type is a 3D sidescrolling mode where the player controls a car. The goal is either to shoot water to put out flaming cars or run over toxic waste to clean it up. The third type is a semi mech game where the player is inside the Lightspeed Megazord and must defeat the enemies on screen. The final game type is sort of a flying game. All that is done is flying around in a hovercraft and collecting boxes. These four gameplay types repeat for 30 levels until the game is eventually completed.[CR]GameBoy Color Version[CR]The GameBoy Color version was developed by Natsume and published by THQ. It was released July 30, 2000.[CR]The player goes around saving trapped citizens from peril. The player has to collect items to open doors and stopping fires. It plays out very much like a puzzle game. There are also playable big Megazord battles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hard and Bonus Levels[CR]You can unlock hard and bonus levels by chooseing titanium quest then highlighting any person and jet levels then pressing z for bonus, r for hard.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy driving glitch.[CR]Whenever you are in a driving mission, simply drive at the upper part of the screen. You will never get touched by any objects thanks to the glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Megazord Arena characters[CR]Beat various enemies during the levels to unlock the same characters in the Megazord Arena.

		<plot>Storyline[CR]Satan has once again decided to create another test by using special magic to pull the Sun closer to the Earth on a remote island. This created a semi-resort, in which characters have decided to visit. Arle, together with Kaa-Kun, find the sun too hot, and see the building that Satan's emanating his own heat wave. Draco loves the hot weather and appears in a bikini, whereas Schezo, who takes refuge in a cave, finds that it's just not cool enough, and decides to find out what's happening.[CR][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Just like the predecessors, Puyos fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise by 90&#176;. The rule of Sousai and Zenkesei still remained, but every time you countered, special garbage would fall on the screen in a preset pattern (in the Game Boy version of this game, it fell randomly). Every time you cleared the screen however, Sun Puyos would fall on the screen, and the All Clear bonus removed.[CR][edit] Sun Puyos[CR]Sun Puyos are very similar to Point Puyos, in the sense that when erased with a neighbouring group, would send more garbage to the opponent. How much extra garbage would follow from a rensa was set up using the Fibonacci sequence, starting at 2 rather than 1, and then back-tracking.[CR]The more Sun Puyos are erased, the more garbage is sent. This was considered a Rensa Bonus rather than a score bonus (as, unlike Point Puyos, they do not increase the score of the chain, just the amount of garbage sent).[CR]Deciding Games[CR]Like with the predecessor, if the third column from the left fills up to the top, the game is over.[CR][CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/574529-puyo-puyo-sun-64[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_SUN[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Carbankle[CR]Hold down start for five seconds on Arle.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All characters are elephants[CR]To show characters as Elephants, at the character selection screen highlight the elephant.

		<title_clean>Quake II</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Main MenuQuake II is a first person shooter developed by id Software and released on December 9, 1997. It was later ported to several systems including the Playstation and Zeebo. Ignoring the Lovecraftian storyline of the original Quake , Quake II sets the player in the role of a lone space marine who must battle the forces of Stroggos in a series of objectives and finally face off against their leader, the Makron. Quake II contains a single player game that can be played cooperatively online and a competitive multiplayer that is still played by fans to this day.id Software released Quake III: Arena two years later which, unlike its predecessors, is a multiplayer focused game. Quake 4, which is a direct sequel to Quake II, was released in 2005 for the Xbox 360 and PC. Quake 4 Special Edition for the PC comes with Quake II and both of its expansion packs, The Reckoning and Ground Zero. Quake 4 for the Xbox 360 only comes with Quake II itself and not its expansions.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]StroggosA space marine named Bitterman finds himself separated from the rest of the invasion for sent to Stroggos when an EMP sends his and the rest of the invasion force's drop pods off course. The mission, Operation Alien Overlord, is in retaliation of an earlier Strogg invasion (later depicted in Splash Damage's Enemy Territory: Quake Wars). Bitterman is tasked with preventing the Strogg from taking over Earth and assimilating its inhabitants. There are several main objectives that Bitterman must complete in order to stop the Strogg. First, he must establish a communications uplink between TCM marine command and the Strogg communication computers. Second, he must destroy the Big Gun which is the air defense system that guards the planet Stroggos. Doing so will allow command to hit the Strogg with an air strike. Next, he must disable the interplanetary gateway to prevent the Strogg from re-launching an attack on Earth. Lastly, he must assassinate the leader of the Strogg, the Makron. Doing so will cripple the Strogg's political structure and prevent the Strogg from organizing an attack.Upon completion of all the objectives, Bitterman make his way to an escape pod and escapes from the Asteroid Arena, the area where the final battle against the Makron commenced. The Asteroid Arena explodes and the escape pod crashes on the planet Stroggos. The final scene shows Bitterman's arm emerging from the wrecked escape pod and he clinches his fist. He would return in the game's expansion packs under different code names.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Quake II is a fast-paced first-person shooter game similar to it predecessor. Some of the weapons from the original Quake make an appearance in Quake II (Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher) along with many new weapons (Blaster, Machine Gun, Chain Gun, Railgun, Hyperblaster, and BFG10K).Single PlayerThe single player of Quake II contains nine missions each with one primary objective and several secondary objectives that must be completed in order to complete the primary objective. Along the way there are plenty of weapons to collect and enemies to shoot. The single player focuses on action and contains no puzzles, except for having to press switches to open up new areas, and minimal backtracking. The game does include a few scripted events such as enemies running away from an imminent air strike, but these mostly consist of monster closets. The area for each mission is very large and has several sections, the game loads whenever the player reaches a different section of the area. Sections are identified by two doors in close proximity to each other, the player enters the first door and before entering the second the game loads. In addition, each section has its own separate statistics for secrets, enemies, goals, etc.MultiplayerQuake II could be played over the internet against other players in the form of standard deathmatch, capture the flag, or 1 vs. 1. Quake II's single player can also be played cooperatively. Due to the multiplayer's immense popularity, id Software decided to rename an upcoming game that was originally unrelated to the Quake franchise Quake III: Arena, ignoring the singleplayer that made the franchise strong for the very first multiplayer focused game.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]WeaponDescriptionBlasterThe starting weapon in Quake II. The Blaster has infinite ammo, but has a slow rate of fire and is very weak.ShotgunThe Shotgun fires 12 pellets and does decent damage at close range. Unlike most shotguns, it can be used effectively at medium range but it useless at long ranges.Super ShotgunThe Super Shotgun fires 20 pellets and is significantly stronger than the shotgun, it fires two shells at once.Machine GunThe Machine Gun is a sub-machine gun with a good rate of fire but strong vertical recoil. Fire it in short bursts or maintain the aim until it reaches the top of its climb.Chain GunThe Chain Gun takes a few seconds to warm up but once it starts shooting it has an extremely high rate of fire and will drain the player's ammo supply very quickly. Unlike the machine gun the chain gun has no vertical climb, but is still inaccurate at long range.GrenadeThe Grenade is a simple weapon that can be thrown or used as ammo for the grenade launcher. The grenade can be cooked by holding the fire button.Grenade LauncherThe Grenade Launcher uses grenades as ammo, once fired the grenades take 3 seconds to explode or if they make contact with an enemy they will explode immediately.Rocket LauncherThe Rocket Launcher fires relatively slow moving rockets that have a large radius of splash damage making it a dangerous weapon to use at close range. Jumping while firing at the ground allows the player to rocket jump to out-of-reach areas.RailgunThe Railgun fires a depleted uranium slug at very high speeds. In the hands of an expert, it is one of the best weapons to use in multiplayer due to its accuracy and damage.HyperblasterThe Hyperblaster is an automatic weapon that fires bolts on energy in a circular pattern. The weapon has to spin down after being fired so it can't be fired again for a few seconds.BFG 10KThe BFG 10K is the most powerful weapon in Quake II, and it is a homeage to the famous BFG 9000 from Doom. When fired, it releases a large green energy ball that shoots out green lasers at nearby enemies. It consumes 50 energy cells per shot and can kill most enemies in one hit.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Enemy (health points)DescriptionLight Guard (20)The Light Guard is the most common and weakest enemy in Quake II. It carries either a Blaster, Shotgun, or Machine Gun and has the lowest amount of health points out of all the enemies in the game. Even in large numbers, the Light Guard posses little threat to the player due to its weak attacks and low health.Barracuda Shark (50)The Barracuda Shark is a rare enemy only found in water and are usually seen travelling in packs.Enforcer (100)The Enforcer is a common enemy in the earlier levels, but in the later levels is much less common. The Enforcer attacks with its chain gun that is attached to his right arm when the player is at a distance. When up close it will attempt to melee the player with his right arm. The Enforcer's low health and slow movements makes it easy to deal with.Berzerker (240)The Berzerker has no range attacks and will only attempt to get up close to the player and use a melee attack. The player can easily tell if a Berzerker has spotted them because it will shot out "Trespasser" when it spots the player. The Berzerker is a quick enemy and its melee attack knocks the player back a long distance or can easily knock the player off of a ledge. However, the attack itself does not do a lot of damage.Gunner (175)The Gunner is a common enemy that has a machine gun on its right arm and a grenade launcher on it left. Despite its relatively low health, the Gunner is one of the deadliest enemies in the game, mostly due to its very powerful grenade launcher. It can fire 4 grenades in quick succession that do massive damage if they directly hit the player.Flyer (50)The Flyer is a small flying robot with low health, it attacks with its blaster cannons at long range and uses its wings to melee the player when up close. They are one of the most annoying enemies in the game because of their small size and the fact that they are flying, which makes them difficult to hit. However, if the player can get them up close a simple shotgun blast will kill them easily.Parasite (175)The Parasite is a four-legged dog-like enemy that attacks by launching a organic tube at the player which drains the players health. The attack is annoying because its almost impossible to dodge and does a lot of damage.Mutant (300)The Mutant is a rare enemy that only appears in two levels. Similar to the Berzerker, it has no range attacks and will only attempt to get up close to melee. It is more dangerous then the Berzerker due to its higher health and more damaging attacks.Brain (300)The Brain is a strange robotic enemy that appears rarely. The Brain has an energy shield on the front that protects it from damage. It has two attacks, an arm hook and releasing tentacles from its chest. Neither attack has a good range and that coupled with its extremely slow speed make it one of the easiest enemies in the game. The only problem is that its energy shield makes it a bullet sponge.Medic (300)The Medic is another rare enemy that attacks using its automatic blaster attached to its right arm. However, attacking is not its main use, the Medic is able to revive any enemy that is not gibbed.Icarus (240)A flying enemy similar to the Flyer except with a lot more health and no melee attack. The Icarus is more of an annoyance than anything, its attack does very little damage and it poses little threat to the player. However, it keeps its distance from the player making it difficult to hit.Technician (200)The technician is a robotic enemy that contains a head encased in liquid. Other than being an incredibly strange enemy, the Technician posses little threat to the player because it is slow and does very little damage.Gladiator (400)The Gladiator is an enemy with high health and a very powerful shoulder mounted Railgun. The Gladiator is one of the most dangerous enemies in the game as its Railgun does a lot of damage and is difficult to dodge and its up close melee attack also does quite a bit of damage as well.Iron Maiden (175)The Iron Maiden is an enemy with a Rocket Launcher attached to its left arm and a claw attached to its right arm that is used for melee. Its Rocket Launcher attack deals heavy damage.Tank (750)The Tank is the strongest normal enemy in Quake II. It is heavily armoured and slow moving and has three main weapons. Its first weapon is a machine gun attached to its right arm which does low damage. Its second weapon is a blaster on its left arm that fires three blasts in a row which deals high damage. Lastly, it has a shoulder mounted Rocket Launcher which fires a stream of rockets and is the Tank's deadliest attack. The Tank is a very powerful enemy and has a lot of health, but if the player can take advantage of its slow speed it is much easier to deal with. Popping in and out of cover to shoot at it with a powerful weapon such as the rocket launcher or BFG10K will keep the player from getting hit by the Tanks deadly attacks. The Tank also has a more powerful variation called the Tank Commander (not to be confused with the boss enemy of the same name). Tank Commanders have the same attacks that do the same amount of damage, the only difference is it has 1000 health points instead of 800. Tank Commanders can only be found in the games final level.Tank Commander (2500)The Tank Commander is a boss enemy that is encountered twice in Quake II. It has tank-like treads to help it move around quickly, and it has two weapons, a chain gun and a rocket launcher. Its chain gun attack is very dangerous because it can kill the player in a mater of seconds and has no start up delay. Its Rocket Launcher attack fires three rockets that do massive damage.Hornet (2000)The Hornet is the second boss enemy, encountered two times (three counting the secret level) in Quake II. It has less health than the Tank Boss, but is harder to hit because it is able to fly. Like the Tank Boss the Hornet has two attacks, a twin chain gun that does the same amount of damage as the Tank Boss' chain gun and a rocket launcher that fires four rockets rather than the three rockets the tank boss fires. The Hornet is a very tough enemy to kill and its chaingun attack is hard to dodge and does a lot of damage.Jorg (3000)The Jorg is an exoskeleton used by the leader of the Strogg, the Makron. It is tied with the Makron himself for the most hit points in the game, and is equipped with twin chain guns. The chain guns deal similar damage to that of the other two bosses, the main difference being the Jorg's chaingun lasts indefinitely while the other bosses chain guns only fire in bursts making the Jorg's chaingun more dangerous. In addition to the chain gun attack, the Makron himself will fire his BFG 10K. This attack is extremely dangerous because the beams that shoot out from a BFG 10K energy shot are extremely hard to dodge and drain the players health and armor very quickly. One BFG 10K shot can kill the player instantly or cripple them if they don't find cover quickly. When Jorg is defeated it will explode and the Makron is left exposed.The Makron (3000)The Makron is the leader of the Strogg and is fought after destroying the Makron's exoskeleton, Jorg. The Makron still has the powerful BFG 10K attack which he uses in the Jorg battle, but he also has two new attacks. The first is a blaster attack that fires 20 blaster shots, the attack does moderate damage but is easily avoided by strafing. The second is a Railgun attack very similar to that of the Gladiator. It can also be dodged by strafing, but is harder to avoid than the blaster attack.[CR]Expansions[CR]Main Articles: Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning and Quake II Mission Pack: Ground ZeroTwo official expansion packs for Quake II were released and neither were developed by id Software. The first, named The Reckoning, was developed by Xatrix Entertainment. The second, named Ground Zero, was developed by Rogue Entertainment. Both added new levels and enemy types, and Ground Zero also added 5 new weapons.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Soundtrack coverThe soundtrack for Quake II was composed mostly by German producer Sonic Mayhem (aka Sascha "Buzzfunk" Dikiciyan) with additional tracks by Bill Brown.Track NumberSong TitleLength1Operation Overlord3:302Rage2:173Kill Ratio2:344March of the Stroggs2:555The Underworld2:366Quad Machine3:377Enter Big Gun3:088Descent into Cerberon2:41Quake II - The ReckoningTrack NumberSong TitleLength1Gravity Well2:352Counter Attack3:133Stealth Frag2:594Crashed Up Again2:565Adrenalinei Junky2:52Quake II - Ground ZeroTrack NumberSong TitleLength1ETF2:522Complex 132:583Pressure Point3:054Pressure Point 22:285Ground Zero Theme4:33[CR]Modern Installation[CR]Quake II Starter is a community made installation package which offers a quick setup for new players, it offers a free, stand-alone and multiplayer enabled version of Q2 (demo + latest patch).Quake II StarterNote: In order to play the single player component, you will need the "pak0" file from the original Q2.[CR]System Requirements[CR]Pentium &#174; 90 MHz processor (133 recommended) or higher or Athlon &#174; processorMemory: 16MB required for Windows 95/98, 24MB required for all other operating systems25MB of uncompressed hard disk space for game files (Minimum Install), plus 45MB for the Windows swap fileQuad-speed CD-ROM driveSupports network and Internet play via IPX and TCP/IP[CR]External links[CR]Official websiteACME CTFQ2sceneTastyspleen[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Quest 64, released by THQ in the United States, is considered the first RPG for the N64 released stateside. It saw a worldwide release,although it was called "Eltale Monsters" in Japan and released by three different publishers (imagineer in Japan, THQ in the United States, and Konami in PAL territories).[CR]While a sequel was announced and canceled, two other titles in the franchise were released for the Game Boy Color. These were Quest RPG: Brian's Journey and Quest: Puzzle Challenge.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Brian Talking to an NPC[CR]The main protagonist is a young Spirit Tamer apprentice, Brian, who is studying Melrode Monastery, located in Celtland, a island of beauty of magic. His father, Lord Bartholomy, has left the monastery in search of the Eltale Book when it has gone missing. The Eltale Book is a sacred book that contains teachings concerning the spirits. Should one not worthy open the book it would be disaster, especially Mammon, a particularly nasty character who, it turns out, has gotten his hands on it.[CR]Like the book, Lord Bartholomy has gone missing. After a month without word from his father, Brian sets out in search of him. While the Eltale Book is key to the plot, Brian's search is primarily for his father, although retrieving the Eltale Book and saving Celtland is all part of the adventure.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Brian traveling the overworld[CR]Quest 64 is considered an RPG. There is no party system or intense number crunching that is characteristic of the genre, with no reaction based gameplay in the overworld and all battles are turn based.[CR]There is a larger world map that offers a variety of terrain and features. Monster encounters can happen anywhere barring towns. Towns are similar to those seen in other RPGs, containing Non-Playable Characters that forward the story and flesh out the game world, and places where resources can be acquired.Battle System[CR]Brian has Hit Points and Magic Points (HP and MP) which govern his behavior in battles. Hit Points make up Brian's life, and should they be depleted, Brian will be returned to the last save (saves are made at inns) with 1 HP (HP can be recovered at the inn). Magic points allow Brian to use specific skills, and should the MP be depleted, skills cannot be used. Brian can recover MP by initiating physical attacks.[CR]There are four types of skills that can use and they correspond to four elements: Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. Each type of skill has a variety of skills associated with them, all of which are appropriate to specific circumstances encountered in battle (distance, type of enemy, etc).Boss fight[CR]Battles occur in a yellow octagon area, and should you move Brian to the exterior, he will escape the battle. A blue octagon will surround Brian signaling his turn. This octagon is the area in which Brian can move during a specific turn. Upon moving, Brian can perform an action (physical attack, skill, or use of an item), and then it is the enemy's turn. They will have a blue octagon appear around them and they are restricted to their octagon much like Brian.[CR]Experience is accumulated through behavior in battles. This happens in three respects. When you attack you increase your attack level. Agility is increased by avoiding enemy attacks, and defense is increased by being hit by enemies. Other than these three aspects there is no level up system that is found in other RPGs.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Agility[CR]If you want a very high Agility stat to avoid enemy attacks more often, there's a very simple way to do it. First, head to an open space - in Brannoch, Melrode and the path along Melrode Monastery work nicely - and start rotating the control stick so that Brian will continuously run in circles. While you're rotating unplug the N64 controller you're using. If done correctly, Brian should still be running in circles. The more you run, the more Agility you gain. With this method you can leave the console on and gain a nice amount of agility without any work. </plot>

		<plot>Description[CR]Innovative 4-point physics engine calculates and monitors all 4 tires independently, creating the most precise simulation of Grand Prix style racing you will ever experience. 16 international courses, and all tracks to scale with realistic dimensions, scenery and environments. Up to 22 racers competing on each track. Arcade, Amateur, Expert and Pro modes. Indestructible cars or real-life damage, dents and shrapnel. Weather effects and multiple road conditions. Start as an inexperienced driver with an entry-level team. As your skill improves, you're invited to race for more prestigious teams.[CR]Monaco Grand Prix known in Europe as Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2 is a Formula one racing game for the Nintendo 64, Sony Playstation, and Sega Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars etc. (The licence was held by Video System at the time who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II.) The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others[citation needed]. This helps to add to the authenticity of the game.[CR]The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.[CR][edit] Trivia[CR]    * Ubisoft did not have the official FIA license. Therefore they licensed only the Monaco track and named the game after it. All other F1 tracks are also included, but using different names.[CR]    * In the United Kingdom the title is 'Racing Simulation: Monaco Grand Prix'[CR]    * In Germany the game is just know as 'Racing Simulation 2' and has a different cover.[CR][CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix_%28video_game%29[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/197968-monaco-grand-prix/data[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Rakuga Kids</title_clean>
		<plot>Rakuga Kids (??????, Rakugakizzu?, Rakugakids) is a 2.5D fighting game created by Konami for the Nintendo 64, released in 1998. The name Rakugakids is a portmanteau of the Japanese word rakugaki (a doodle), and kids, a reflection of the visual style of the game which resembled children's drawings.[CR][CR][B]Basics:[/B][CR]The game is similar in play to a toned-down Marvel vs. Capcom. The button layout is the fighting game standard six-buttons (Three punches and three kicks.), which produce special moves when combined with various directional commands.[CR]All characters have a single-button attack that sends the opponent into the air, where they can pursue them and follow up with an aerial attack. Perhaps to complement this, each character can perform an additional jump while in the air.[CR]Magic[CR]Super Combos in this game are referred to as "Magic" and a player can have up to three levels of Magic (Represented by three crayons that appear at the bottom of the screen.). Super Meter levels can be spent in three ways: Offense (An attack that causes heavy damage with a few hits.), Defense (An attack that causes little damage, but sends the opponent far away.) and Counter (Usable only while the character is blocking, causes medium damage and sends the opponent flying away, like Defense Magic.)[CR][CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]    * Astronots: A Buck Rogers-like astronaut and the game's protagonist. He fights using assorted pulp-era sci-fi devices like a raygun and rocket boots. He is like the typical Ryu of the game.[CR]    * Captain. Cat. Kit: An anthropomorphic cat dressed like a stereotypical rapper. Fights using brass instruments, a basketball and breakdancing moves. Also has the ability to spontaneously combust at will.[CR]    * Marsa A witch bearing a hat that acts like a chicken. Marsa is the only one who can triple jump, and her 'Marsa Jump' sends her far up off screen. Used strategically, you can avoid danger with it.[CR]    * Robot C.H.O: The game's heavyweight grappler character. A robot who can transform into various metal objects, like a trashcan or a car. Interestingly, the spinning letters on its hand and head will change depending on its actions.[CR]    * Beartank: A green bear with tank guns on its head and back. It can change its body into a set of tank treads (Leaving only its head exposed.) and fire small copies of itself from either gun. For some reason, it is constantly sleeping. It is the speediest character, the second being Captain. Cat. Kit.[CR]    * Cools. Roy A cowboy-like character, who fights with honor (his taunt is a bow to the opponent). He is a palette-swap of Astronots.[CR]    * Mamezo: a yellow Cartoon-villain with a green cape. His moves are mostly Jelli-like Transformations in various gadgets and tools (like a fork, an iron, a scissor and more) or summon rockets and other things. He was supposed to be the main villain in the intro.[CR]Hidden Characters[CR]    * Inuzo: The game's sub-boss character. A palette-swap of Mamezo with identical moves.[CR]    * Darkness: The game's boss character.[CR][CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]    * In Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, Nathan (The game's protagonist) can transform into the Beartank character by equipping the Bear Ring and activating the Black Dog and Pluto cards (Which normally transforms him into a Skeleton).[CR]    * Beartank also appears as a secret character in Konami Krazy Racers.[CR]    * Music from the game also appears in some of Konami's Bemani games, namely Beatmania GB and Pop n' Music.[CR][CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/562842-rakuga-kids[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuga_Kids[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra options[CR]Play for over ten hours.

Arcade - you must simply select one of the 3 difficulty settings, one of the available cars and compete with the other 8 CPU players for the first place. Each difficulty setting has 3 races and the place you manage to get at the end of each race is carried on to the next one. Car damage does not apply in this mode. [CR]2. Championship - you race in a total of 9 rounds with 3 laps per round. In each round you get points depending on what position you finished in and in the end these points are accumulated to decide your final ranking.

Effects from the damage include lesser top speed, slower acceleration and bad steering. It is also possible to customize certain options like tires, steering, etc., to get the best possible performance depending on the weather condition on each course.[CR]3. Practice - mode where you can learn the controls and get acquainted with the various courses of the game.[CR]4. Vs Race - allows up to 4 players to play simultaneously in any of the games courses.</plot>

		<title_clean>Rampage - World Tour</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Rampage World Tour is the sequel to the classic NES and arcade game Rampage. Rampage World Tour was released in 1997 on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and the PC, with poor reviews, but good sales. Later on, the game was ported to various consoles including the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and even has a downloadable version available on the PS3's PlayStation Network.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Poor civilians, don't know whats going to happen...The game has you choosing between three different monsters. George is an ape-like monster that resembles King Kong, Lizzie is a lizard, and Ralph is a werewolf. All of these monsters were once humans who were mutated during experiments at a company called "Scum Labs." To get revenge against "Scum Labs," you need to travel through various cities, destroying planes, tanks, helicopters, and buildings to advance. You must also destroy the "Scum Labs" building that is at the end of each level. The gameplay consists of players climbing up and down buildings, destroying each level until they collapse. Along the way, various enemies try to stop you, including tanks, helicopters, soldiers, and police cars. They will throw grenades, shoot missiles, tank shells, and bullets at you, to try and turn you back to your human form. After taking enough damage from either enemies, or falling off buildings, you will revert back to a small human, and run off to the left of the screen while covering their naked bodies with their hands. The game also added 2 player co-op where players can team up with a friend, to wreak havoc with two monsters. This is George, he is angry, he is an ape.Some of the improvements from the original include semi-3D backgrounds, as well as power ups for your characters. One of the main power ups is eating a toxic waste can, which turns your character into a flying monster, until the level ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At either the main menu or the character-select screen, hold L and all four of the C buttons for three seconds until you hear a signal.  Now when you begin the game, wait for the name of the first city to appear.  When the name of the first city comes up, use either the joystick or the control pad to warp directly to any level.  To change countries, press Up or Down and to change cities, press Left or Right.  You can also go to all of the secret stages.</plot>

		<plot>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2: Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]At the password screen, enter the following:</plot>

		<title_clean>Rayman 2 - The Great Escape</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rayman 2: The Great Escape is a 3D platformer that was developed by Ubisoft and first released in 1999. Players take control of Rayman, a limbless hero whose main attack is shooting his fists and energy balls at his opponents. This is the first Rayman game to be made in 3D. Rayman's powers include shooting his fists (which take the form of energy balls) and his helicopter ears (which allow him to descend slowly, and sometimes fly). He is also able to grab onto ledges and attain new heights via the use of purple lums. Lastly, he is able to innovate, riding a plum down a river of lava, riding on the back of a rocket, flying with a flaming gunpower barrel, and hitching a ride attached to a swamp creature named Ssssam.[CR]Unlike its predecessor, Rayman 2's visual design and score strike a much more dark and dreary tone, while still not taking away the mystifying and vibrant universe that is iconic to the Rayman games. Levels range from marshlands to oceanic bays to crazy dreamworlds to lava temples and robot pirate ship grottoes.[CR]Rayman 2 received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the fact that the series managed to make the transition from 2D to 3D much more seamlessly than a number of other similar platformers.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]On a dark and stormy night, Ly the Fairy reaches out to Rayman for help. The world is in trouble. Admiral Razorbeard and his pirate army have taken over most of the world and enslaved its inhabitants. Unfortunately, Rayman has been captured and put aboard the pirate ship Buccaneer. His friend Globox is thrown into a room with him shortly after, and Rayman remarks to his old friend that he feels weak, and that this may be the end. Luckily, Globox had been given a silver lum by Ly, which in turn he gives to Rayman. It rejuvenates him, and together they bust out of the ship.[CR]After a long trip down, Rayman lands in the Woods of Light, one of the few places the pirates have not infiltrated. Globox is nowhere to be found, but Rayman does come into contact with Murfy, who provides him with guidance. He also finds the Teensies, who show him the way to the Hall of Doors. Once there, Rayman travels to the Fairy Glade, where he saves a weakened Ly the Fairy from the pirates. He then learns how dire the situation really is. The pirates hold sway in almost all corners of the world. Razorbeard has also split the heart of the world into 1000 lums and scattered them throughout.[CR]To set things right, Rayman needs to find the 4 masks of power. Only by having these 4 masks can he summon Polokus, the creator of the world, who will then be able to destroy the pirates once and for all. As soon as Rayman gets this information, he is off. Along the way, he will encounter much resistance, many challenges, and a pirate captain bent on the destruction of his world. No problem, for a hero without limbs.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Rayman 2 features an array of imaginative and colorful characters, perfectly complementing the exciting gameplay experience.Rayman[CR]Rayman is an unsuspecting hero who is dragged into the fight against the pirates, while also being responsible for repairing the damage that has been done to the world through the collection of items known as lums. Clearly the plight of the world is close to his heart, as he is friends to a number of the creatures of the forest including Globox and Ly.[CR] Globox[CR]Globox is a dear friend of Rayman that you first encounter at the beginning of the game as you help him to escape from his pirate cell. Despite being a huge coward, Globox can often be useful throughout the game with his ability to use magic, an example being his special &#8216;rain-dance&#8217;.[CR] Murfy[CR]Following the tradition of many games in the platforming genre, Rayman 2 also features a tutorial fairy, known as Murfy. Responsible for introducing the player to various game mechanics and items, Murfy clearly is an important ally for those new to the game. Murfy can be summoned by the player standing on his corresponding tile.[CR] Ly[CR]Ly the fairy is another friend of Rayman who helps him out in a different way to Murfy. During their first encounter (in which Rayman rescues Ly from being held captive by the pirates), Ly gives Rayman the power to use purple lums. Ly also helps to grant Rayman greater power throughout the progress of the game, through items known as silver lums.[CR] Razorbeard[CR]Razorbeard is the leader of the evil robot pirates, and forms an inexplicably evil adversary to Rayman. With an army of giant airships and hordes of evil minions he clearly poses a great threat to the sanctity of the world. His evil deeds know no bounds, as we discover that he has imprisoned many of the creatures of the land and has ravaged the world of its magical power (the lums), which Rayman must find scattered throughout the world.[CR] Polokus[CR]Polokus is an ancient being that sits on a totem in the Spirit World awaiting the four magic masks, which Rayman is required to locate. Only after awakening the spirit of Polokus does Rayman truly stand a chance of defeating the pirates.[CR] Clark[CR]The buff, broad-shouldered, balloon-chinned giant known as Clark is another friend of Rayman. He is first encountered in the Menhir Hills level, where he asks Rayman to bring him medicine from the Cave of Bad Dreams. After he has been cured, he allows Rayman to ride on top of his back as he smashes through walls. He returns later in the game in a mind-controlled state as a mini-boss that Rayman must defeat.[CR] Carmen[CR]Carmen the whale is another odd friend of Rayman who is also captured by the pirates and must be freed by Rayman. In the PlayStation version Carmen leads Rayman to the Temple of Water and Ice; in all other versions she leads him out of the level.[CR] Sssssam[CR]Sssssam the snake acts as the ferryman of the glades. He is trapped in a cage by the evil pirates, but is rescued by Rayman during the game. To show his gratitude, Sssssam then gives Rayman a ride through the Marshes of Awakening along a treacherous water ski-like course, at the end of which he leaves Rayman to continue his adventure alone.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]PlayStation[CR]The PlayStation version only featured fewer lums to collect as well as truncated level design to compensate for the system hardware. This version also features enemies and boss fights not seen in any other version including an enemy last seen in the original Rayman. Along with the PlayStation 2 version, the game featured complete voice overs for the dialogue.Nintendo 64Nintendo 64 US BoxartRiding down the muck[CR]The Nintendo 64 version featured compatibility with the N64 Expansion Pak. It also featured music converted and fitted to work with the hardware as the other versions used CD audio. This was also the base version of Rayman DS and is similar to the PC version.PC/WindowsThe PC version looks and sounds great. However it does not feature any of the enhancements seen in the Dreamcast version.[CR]The PC version runs similar to the Nintendo 64 version retaining some features from the disc based versions. It can run at high resolutions and features the best quality sound out of all the other versions. The PC version suffers from a few issues such as un-customizable controls for both keyboard and joystick/gamepads and the installer is incompatible with 64-bit processors and cannot be installed on such platforms. This version is currently available for purchase on GOG.com and is able to run on 64-bit systems due to a different installer wrapper. It was also given free to pre-purchase owners of Rayman Origins on Steam.Sega DreamcastThe Dreamcast release runs at 60 frames per second maximum.[CR]The Dreamcast version is considered the best version of the game with higher resolution graphics, fast framerate, and extra features including online downloadable content such as mini games and a 4 player multiplayer mode. Levels are given additional geometry and effects to take advantage of the hardware compared to the versions released before. This version added 6 Globox Crystals hidden in a few levels that could be taken to the Globox Village to unlock bonuses. This was also the base version of Rayman 3D.Playstation 2 (Rayman 2 Revolution)Environments are given a substantial upgrade over every other version of the game.[CR]The Playstation 2 version was an even further enhanced version of Rayman 2 running on the Renderware engine. Graphics were given more detail, levels were expanded and the world map was replaced with a hub world that would also feature a more prominent appearance of other characters such as Clark and Carmen. Cutscenes are expanded and is given speech for all supported languages and features more detailed "Raymanian" speech. This version also suffers from some framerate issues and sound glitches. Currently this version of the game is available for download on the Playstation Store for Playstation 3 owners.Nintendo DS (Rayman DS)Rayman DS US Cover Art[CR]Rayman 2 was ported to the DS soon after it's launch under the name "Rayman DS" to capitalize on the launch window of the Nintendo DS system and intended to take advantage of the success similar to Rayman Advance on Game Boy Advance. Converted from the Nintendo 64 version by DC Studios, it faced several conversion issues. For example due to the smaller cartridge size, certain textures are compressed and certain indicators are unintelligible due to improper scaling. Much like Super Mario 64's DS, players could utilize the touch screen as a replicated analog control stick, but was criticized as being too imprecise.Nintendo 3DS (Rayman 3D)Nintendo 3DS EU cover art.The 3DS port was rushed for launch of the system and suffers from a number of performance issues.[CR]The Nintendo 3DS version was converted from the Sega Dreamcast version and makes use of the analog slide pad for analog control and the system's 3D capabilities.The difficulty has been toned down to better adapt for quick play on the handheld format similar to the DSi port of the original Rayman. The game now saves after each section or cutscene, Rayman rotates with the camera when holding left or right on the D-Pad to turn the camera, health refills after being inflicted with instant death and certain sections have been altered for easier progress. The game was poorly adapted to the hardware to make it in time for system launch and has received numerous faults. The framerate is wildly inconsistent and sluggish at more intense areas, sound effects are missing or cut out during normal gameplay while music sounds overdriven, certain skybox textures alias incorrectly, certain scenery and objects are incorrectly scaled, and texture work sometimes appears stretched or missing. Reports indicated prior to launch that the 4 player mini game would return for local wireless multiplayer, however it does not exist in the final version as the Dreamcast DLC, Globox Village and collectables associated with it have been removed from this version.iPhone/iPad[CR]Gameloft has converted the game to the iPhone which is also compatible with iTouch, and iPad. Controls are entirely touch based with "Virtual" joysticks and key actions mapped to the screen.[CR]Some boss characters, such as Colossus and Ninjaws do not appear in every version. Interactive cut-scenes are also cut from certain versions.[CR]Game Boy Color Version (Rayman 2 Revolution)[CR]Rayman and Globox in a cutscene image from the Game Boy Color version.Most of Rayman's moves resembe the powers seen in the first Rayman game on 32-bit platforms.[CR]Much like Rayman 1 on Game Boy Color, Rayman 2 saw an 8-bit portable rendition on Nintendo's handheld and features new levels and content. In the US, it shared the same name as the major console version. Whereas in the UK, it was named Rayman 2 Revolution but is not to be confused with the Playstation 2 version. Playing similarly to Rayman on Game Boy Color, creatures are locked away in cages and must be freed by Rayman in order to fight back the pirate army. Unlike the last Game Boy title, the password system was replaced by a battery back-up save system to keep and restore progress and does not contain any Ubi-Key features.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]Windows 95/98Pentium 133 (Min.)4x CD-ROM drive (Min.)32 MB RAM (Min.)4MB D3D compatible graphics card.DirectX compatible sound card.300MB free hard drive space.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Maximum &amp;amp; full life bar[CR]In any level of the game, enter this timed sequence to have the biggest life bar available and refill it. You may need some practice to do it since it's timed: listen to the thematic music of the game, which does something like "tam, tatam, tatatatam" and reproduce the timing using the right (or is it left? sorry it was a looonnng time ago) trigger. When you read the sequence, 'R' is "hold right trigger", 'r' is "release right trigger" and '...' indicates a small duration. It's really easy to do once you got it: all in all, you're just going to press the R button four times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Nemesis Mini-Game[CR]Whilst the ending is playing, press A+B simultaneously and repeatedly, to play the Nemesis Minigame.</plot>

		<title_clean>Razmoket, Les - La Chasse aux Tresors</title_clean>
		<plot>In their big debut on the Nintendo 64, the favorite cartoon babies are about to get wrapped up in the scavenger hunt to end all scavenger hunts. Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In "The Pirate Treasure Hunt," the babies travel underwater in search of items; "Angelica's Temple of Gloom" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and "Reptar Rally" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.</plot>

		<title_clean>Re-Volt</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Re-Volt is a racing game in which players take control of a variety of remote controlled cars (24 in total) and race them on 14 tracks featuring realistic environments such as museums, toy stores, gardens, and suburban neighborhoods. Like many similar games, there were powerups your car could collect to either give yourself an advantage or slow down an opponent.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]The game features six different single player game modes:Championship[CR]The player completes multiple races in order to unlock the next three tracks, earning points towards a total based on their finishing position in each race. Although you have a fixed number of laps to race you are allowed to choose the difficulty of the game. There are four different championships to beat: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Each victory in a championship unlocks new cars and the next set of tracks.Single Race[CR]In this mode you can drive the tracks reverse, mirrored or both at the same time against the computer AI.Practice[CR]In this mode, there are no opponents or obstacles, and the player is free to drive around the track at his or her leisure. There is a star hidden in a hard-to-reach location of each level. Collecting these stars unlocks more vehicles.Time Trial[CR]This mode gives the player a set challenge lap time to beat. By attaining these challenge times, players unlock new cars.Stunt Arena[CR]The stunt arena is a map exclusive to this mode, and features a loop, many jumps, and a large halfpipe. There are twenty stars hidden throughout the map, and the Clockwork Carnage mode is unlocked when all of the stars have been collected.Clockwork Carnage[CR]In Clockwork Carnage, the player races against twenty-nine other AI opponents. Every player uses the same small, very light, wind-up car.[CR]Cars[CR]Re-Volt has thirty-four cars (not counting custom cars) in the PC version of the game, all with different attributes and sorted into five classes, Rookie, Amateur, Advanced, Semi-Pro, and Pro. As one completes challenges for specific levels of tracks, new cars are unlocked. For instance in order to unlock all of the Advanced Cars, a player must complete the Silver Championship, find all of the practice stars in the new tracks in the championship, and place first in a single race on each one.[CR]While there is a large variety of cars in the game, one car is particularly notable for being the best, namely the Pro car Toyeca. In multiplayer matches and overall, Toyeca has the best combination of speed and handling, and is unquestionably the best car to use. This has led to the other cars being completely ignored for the purposes of competitive multiplayer.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The multiplayer mode in Re-Volt consists of two modes, Single Race and Battle Tag.[CR]In Battle Tag mode you start in one of four Arenas, which are reworked versions of the single player maps. The goal in this mode is to obtain a star, which is placed on the map. Every player has a countdown timer, and when one player has possession of the star, the timer counts down. The winner is the player who manages to keep the star until his or her timer runs out. Other players can take the star away from you by bumping into you. Your position on the map is given away on the other players' HUD as long as the star is in your possession.[CR]Single Races are just like the races in single player mode, with the computer players being replaced by human players. The player limit on the console versions is four players, while the PC version allows for up to twelve player races. On consoles the game is played via split screen, while on PC one can play the game via TCP/IP online or in your local network. Microsoft's Zone service as well as the GameSpy Arcade were alternate ways to play this game online.[CR]Customization[CR]The PC version of the game is notable for the plethora of custom cars and levels that have been created by the fanbase using the in-game tools (which include a custom track editor and a hidden in-game editing tool) as well as PC modeling programs. A small community has developed dedicated to creating completely original cars as well as repaints of the cars in-game, as well as levels that, in some cases, have been created from scratch.[CR]Re-Volt Online[CR]During the development of Microsoft's online gaming platform Xbox Live, Re-Volt was the first game to be playable online. The game was accessible for Microsoft executives and the press to demonstrate the new service, including competitive online multiplayer and voice chat.[CR]With the five year anniversary of Xbox Live in 2007, Microsoft released an official farewell tribute to Re-Volt on its homepage.[CR]Heritage[CR]The license and publishing rights to Re-Volt were bought in 2006 by the Canadian game publisher Throwback Entertainment. The publisher also confirmed that a next-generation version of the game is to be expected.[CR]iOS[CR]Big Bit released a port of Re-Volt to iOS.

		<title_clean>Resident Evil 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Resident Evil 2 (or Biohazard 2 in Japan) is a survival horror game that was originally released in 1998 by Capcom. Resident Evil 2 primarily utilizes the same mechanics and gameplay styles as the previous Resident Evil, but with updated graphics and a new story set only three months after the original.[CR]On August 12th, 2015, a remake of Resident Evil 2 was finally announced after years of high demand from fans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] &amp; ControlsClaire aiming up towards an attacking Licker[CR]The gameplay of Resident Evil 2 is virtually the same as the gameplay of the first one, and features a mix of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving. Players move via a series of pre-determined camera angles and control their character with 'tank controls', much like most survival horror games of the era. Combat as such is rather rudimentary, as players simply aim their weapon with R1 and shoot with X (default PS1 controls). They can aim up or down this way as well, though with the assistance of auto-aim (which can be turned off) combat is a relatively simple affair. To make up for it, however, ammunition is scarce, and thusly forces players to choose between whether it's worth engaging in combat or attempting to flee.[CR]The story is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.Difficulty Settings[CR]There are two difficulty settings available across most ports of Resident Evil 2 -- Rookie and Normal. Normal plays much like how the game was intended, whereas Rookie lessens enemy health and gifts players some additional handgun ammunition and first aid sprays in the item box.[CR]The PC version features a Hard difficulty setting, which increases enemy health and damage. The N64 version also has available an Arranged mode that mixes all of the items in the game around, similar to the mode found in Resident Evil: Director's Cut.Playable Characters[CR]Like the original Resident Evil, there are two playable characters to choose from -- Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, sister of Chris Redfield. However unlike the original, the two characters do in fact coincide and have varying storylines from one another, whereas both Chris &amp; Jill's were essentially the same minus a few details.[CR]Mechanically-speaking the two characters are now practically identical to one another. They both can withstand the same degree of damage and have the same maximum inventory slots. The story itself dictates the differences, as it'll take each in slightly different directions of the Raccoon Police Department, and they each feature their own set of unique puzzles to solve, weapons to collect, and characters to meet.Ada Wong, supporting character amidst Leon's story[CR]Leon's story will bring him into contact with femme-fatale, Ada Wong. Claiming to be a civilian on the search for her boyfriend, she will provide assistance to Leon throughout the game. On two occasions she will follow as an invincible AI companion for a short time, armed with a HP browning pistol. Alongside being invincible, she has infinite ammo (though must at least reload when necessary) and will help kill any enemies the two encounter through their travels.[CR]Beyond those sequences, players will also be forced to take control of Ada on two occasions for story purposes. She controls exactly like Leon and Claire, and has available her HP Browning pistol and a single first aid spray. However her weapon stance is different from both characters, and it gives her an increase in firing rate with her pistol.[CR]Claire too has a playable supporting character, however her's is the twelve year old Sherry Birkin. Like Ada, she too will function both as a friendly NPC and as a playable character. However because she is only twelve, she has no means of attack available. When following as an NPC, players cannot run off too far otherwise Sherry will crouch down and cower, awaiting Claire's return. When standing still Sherry and Claire will hold hands, though they will let go once Claire starts moving again.Sherry Birkin, a lost twelve year old girl[CR]As a playable character she once again has no means of attack (she does at least have a first aid spray) and must attempt to avoid enemies. Though because of her small stature, zombies at least will not be able to bite her and will only attempt to vomit acid on her instead, which does considerably less damage. As well as having no means of attack, Sherry has a slower running speed than all the other characters in the game.[CR]For the PS1 version their stories are restricted to their own disc--one for Leon, one for Claire--however most physical ports since then have compiled them onto one.The A and B ScenariosClaire &amp; Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Leon A / Claire B[CR]Resident Evil 2 featured four different scenarios; the first two were labelled as Leon A and Claire B scenarios, where Leon entered the police station through the front entrance and Claire through the back door. The second two scenarios, labelled as Claire A and Leon B, had the roles reversed with the plotline slightly altered. Each scenario provided a different experience such as meeting with Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh on Scenario A, and being stalked by the T-103 'Mr. X' Tyrant during Scenario B.[CR]Players first only have access to Leon &amp; Claire's A Scenario, though upon completing either will then be asked to create a new save slot for the alternate character's B Scenario.[CR]There are a handful of player choices that can carry over from A Scenario to B. As either character, they will eventually stumble upon a minipack and submachine gun. The A Scenario character can choose to take it with them, or they could instead leave it for the B Scenario character to collect instead. There is also a room located within the Umbrella Lab near the end of the game that requires two hand print IDs to open. As such, it can only be opened once both Scenario characters have registered their hand print and then placed their hand on the scanner, allowing the B Scenario character to its contents.[CR]They are the two most notable crossovers, though there are smaller effects as well, such as leaving the zombified Marvin Branagh alive in Scenario A, which will then have him continue to persist in the alternate character's B Scenario.Claire &amp; Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Claire A / Leon B[CR]Since Resident Evil 2 featured several different combinations of events and endings, it was for a time left ambiguous as to which ordering was the true version. However it was eventually confirmed by Capcom via the official Resident Evil timeline in Resident Evil 5 that the canon order is the Claire A &amp; Leon B telling.[CR]During Claire's B Scenario, there is only one segment of the game where players must control Sherry, as opposed to two in the A Scenario.InventoryInventory screen, with the character's health up top.[CR]All characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots, though each character also has a unique item in a static ninth slot. Leon at first has a lighter, which must otherwise be acquired within the RPD as Claire, and Claire has a lockpick. Though unlike Jill's capabilities in Resident Evil, Claire can only use it to open up locked drawers to acquire some additional supplies. Leon must instead locate small keys to open the drawers. Leon will also eventually replace his lighter with a G-Virus vial, though it is only carried for narrative purposes, serves no mechanical use, and is only temporary at that before he throws it away and finds himself with his lighter again.[CR]Supporting characters Ada &amp; Sherry each only have a photograph; Ada's is of her and her boyfriend John, while Sherry's is of her and her parents, William and Annette Birkin. The photographs serve no mechanical use, however.[CR]There are certain weapons that will take up 2 slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:Submachine gunFlamethrowerSpark ShotGatling GunRocket Launcher[CR]Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays[CR]A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine (Green) - The character is in good health.Caution (Yellow) - The character is roughly at half health.Danger (Red) - The character is approaching death.Poison (Purple) - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.[CR]Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.[CR]Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.Red Herb - On its own does nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.Saving[CR]Like the original, Resident Evil 2 requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersLeon S. Kennedy[CR]One of two protagonists, Leon is a rookie cop who managed to avoid the massacre of the Raccoon City police force--as first detailed in Resident Evil 3--via serendipity after sleeping in on the day he was supposed to show. Despite his lack of experience as a police officer--with this literally being his first day on the job--Leon is a surprisingly capable individual, and has underwent weapons training for a number of firearms at the academy crediting to his variable weapons skills.[CR]While he can be aptly described as 'wet behind the ears' and even a little naive, Leon is still a good-natured soul, and will try with all of his might to assist any fellow survivors in any way he can.Voiced by Paul Haddad.Claire Redfield[CR]Nineteen year old sister to S.T.A.R.S. officer Chris Redfield and fellow protagonist to Leon, Claire is wrapped up into the Raccoon City nightmare by unfortunate happenstance. Arriving by motorbike in her attempts to find Chris, who unbeknownst to her had left for Europe to investigate the Umbrella Corp., she must quickly adapt to the horror and use all of her instincts to survive.[CR]Being something of a tomboy, Claire had spent many a time practicing with firearms at a firing range, and has also been tutored by Chris himself. Claire is as such strongly independent and resourceful, and will also have to exercise her sisterly instincts whence she comes into contact with twelve year old Sherry Birkin.Voiced by Alyson Court.Ada Wong[CR]A mysterious young woman whom Leon eventually encounters amidst his search of the Raccoon Police Precinct, she claims she is but a lost civilian that is trying to locate her boyfriend, John. The aura of mystery that surrounds her, however, hints at an ulterior motive.[CR]Exceptionally capable and a fine marksman with a pistol, Ada quickly proves to be a valuable ally throughout the game, regardless of what her true intentions may be.Voiced by Sally Cahill.Sherry Birkin[CR]A lost twelve year old girl, Sherry has managed to evade danger and get around via the air vents. However she is eventually cornered by Claire, who takes it upon herself to try and protect her. The daughter of Umbrella scientists William &amp; Annette Birkin, she is completely unaware of their involvement with the Raccoon City disaster.[CR]Before the outbreak Sherry was rarely given any attention from her parents, whom were always far too enveloped in their work. As such, Sherry is shy and finds it difficult to open up to people.Voiced by Lisa Yamanaka.Ben Bertolucci[CR]A journalist and contact of Ada Wong, Ben has willingly locked himself up in a Police Department jail cell in the hopes that it'll better provide safety against the zombies and other monsters that have plagued the station.[CR]Ben was originally working on uncovering corruption within the R.P.D., and as such is weary and standoffish towards police officers.Voiced by Rod Wilson.Brian Irons[CR]The Chief of Police for the Raccoon Police Department, Brian at first presents himself as someone merely trying to survive and make sense of the horror that has engulfed the city. However it is soon revealed that he is not only something of a sadist, but is in fact receiving bribes from the Umbrella Corporation.[CR]His closing of the case surrounding the Mansion Incident from Resident Evil--while refuting any accusations towards Umbrella's involvement--is what lead to the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members to disband and investigate on their own.Voiced by Gary Krawford.Annette Birkin[CR]An Umbrella scientist, mother of Sherry Birkin and wife to William Birkin, Annette is riddled with grief over the Raccoon City disaster. In part because of what has happened to William, but also as she frantically tries to locate Sherry for reasons that aren't entirely the instincts of a loving mother.[CR]On the surface she seems like any sympathetic mother trying to find her daughter, but her paranoia concerning the enigmatic G-Virus, and her devotion to William, slowly begins to consume her.Voiced by Jennifer Dale.William Birkin[CR]One of Umbrella's top researchers and the creator of the G-Virus, William is soon betrayed by Umbrella, and in a desperate act to survive an attack by their agents he injects himself with his own creation. As such, William has become something other than human, and will continually come into conflict with Leon and Claire throughout the game.Voiced by Diego Matamores.[CR] PremiseLeon &amp; Claire[CR]Resident Evil 2 follows the story of rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield during the zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. On his first day on the job, Leon finds a dead body on the road as he enters the city and leaves his car to investigate. Claire Redfield, sister to leading hero from the original Resident Evil Chris Redfield, also arrives in the city at the same time by motorbike in her attempts to find her brother.[CR]The two are soon enveloped by an onslaught of zombies; Leon is ambushed by zombies on the Raccoon City streets, whereas Claire encounters the undead while exploring a deserted diner. The two soon meet up with one another and commandeer an abandoned police car; Claire then collects the Browning HP pistol from the cruiser's glovebox. They begin driving through the city only to be caught in an accident due to a zombie hiding in the car's backseat, while also colliding with a truck that's being driven by a man in the midst of turning into a zombie. The accident forces Leon and Claire to split up and decide to rendezvous at the police station.Plot[CR]Note: This plot description specifically details the canon Claire A / Leon B sequence of the story.Claire RedfieldRobert Kendo's gruesome demise[CR]Upon escaping the wreckage, Claire takes shelter in a nearby gun store from the encroaching horde of zombies. There she meets the owner Robert Kendo, who offers his store to act as a safe haven. However it isn't long before zombies smash through the window and devour Kendo.[CR]Claire is once again able to escape and eventually reaches the Raccoon Police Department. There she encounters a mortally wounded police officer, Marvin Branagh, who hands her a keycard to unlock the doors. Marvin also briefs Claire about the events of the original Resident Evil, while also stating how the surviving STARS officers--including her brother--have disappeared. Claire attempts to assist Marvin, however he instead forces her to leave the room at gunpoint and then locks the door once she leaves.[CR]With the keycard in hand, Claire is able to unlock the main hall doors and begin her exploration of the precinct. Upon the STARS office, she finds Chris' diary, detailing his leaving of the city to head to Europe to further investigate the Umbrella Corporation. When exiting the office, she encounters a small girl; the girl then reactively runs away out of fear. Claire gives chase but loses her, though is also then reunited with Leon in the nearby corridor, who hands her a radio so they can better keep in touch. While disheartened by the discovery that Chris isn't in Raccoon City, Leon states that they both need to scour for survivors and then ultimately escape the city. Claire agrees, and the two part ways.[CR]Determined to find the little girl, Claire continues her search. She is eventually able to access Chief of Police Brian Irons' office, where he himself still resides. On his table is the corpse of the mayor's daughter; Brian admits that he killed her, but only because she was turning into a zombie. Brian then asks that he be left alone.Chief of Police, Brian Irons[CR]Claire decides to explore the backroom that leads out of Irons' office. Inside is the little girl, who Claire finally manages to corner. Claire reassures her that she's not a zombie and merely wants to help. The little girl says her name is Sherry. After the brief introduction, Sherry states that she is looking for her parents and that there's more than just zombies roaming throughout the station. A load roar can be heard, which startles Sherry and forces her to run away again. Claire then heads back to Irons' office, only to find both he and the corpse gone. His diary is left on his desk chair; reading it reveals Irons' sordid activities involving hunting and trapping other police officers, as well as his involvement with the Umbrella Corporation. Behind his desk is a strange puzzle requiring three square stones to be placed.[CR]Heading deeper into the station, Claire investigates the station's underground. There she again encounters Sherry, who thinks she heard her father calling for her. Crawling through a small opening in a fence, Sherry once again goes off on her own against Claire's wishes. While exploring the area, she locates some supplies for Claire, but again decides to go off on her own in search of her father.[CR]After locating all three stone pieces, Claire returns to Brian Irons' office. There she is reunited with Sherry, who Claire pleads that she stay close. After setting the stones, it unlocks a secret passage in the wall; Claire tells Sherry to wait in the office while she climbs down the ladder. Claire is then held at gunpoint by Irons', who explains his frustration that Umbrella have destroyed his ''beautiful town'' and his involvement with the company. He also lets loose that the creator of the G-Virus, William Birkin, is the father of Sherry. Noticing that he's at his rope's end and believes he's going to die, he decides that he's going to take Claire with him.Claire rescuing Sherry from the garbage disposal dump[CR]However before he can act, Brian begins to convulse with pain as his chest is torn apart by a parasitic larvae. Heading down the ladder leading towards the sewers, the larvae then begins to grow into a large, humanoid monster. Claire is able to best the creature and it ultimately disintegrates. Returning to Sherry, the two continue through the sewers; Claire also radios Leon that Brian Irons' office is accessible, and thet she's heading to the sewers with Sherry. However Sherry is once again forced to split-up with Claire as she accidentally falls down a drainage gate. On her own, Sherry explores throughout the sewers, but falls down into a large garbage pile and falls unconscience as she limply calls for Claire. A large, monstrous creature then appears and infects Sherry with a parasitic larvae.[CR]Amidst Claire's search for Sherry, she encounters her mother, Annette Birkin. While holding Claire at gunpoint, Annette explains Umbrella's betrayal of she and her husband William Birkin, and how William injected himself with his own G-Virus after an attack on his life by Umbrella Security Service agents. The G-Virus turned him into a monster as he soon slaughtered the U.S.S. agents, minus one -- HUNK. This attack let loose many T-Virus vials, which were feasted on by rats. This then set into motion the T-Virus infection of Raccoon City.[CR]After Annette claims that William is likely searching for their daughter Sherry, the two split-up to find her first. Claire manages to locate Sherry unconscience on the garbage pile, however she must first fight her way past a giant alligator. Once that's done, she helps Sherry up, both of whom are unaware of Sherry's larvae infection.[CR]The two continue onward, finally managing to escape out of the sewers and coming upon a hidden Umbrella factory. There the two board a stationary tram as it heads downwards, taking the two to an Umbrella Laboratory. However as the tram descends, Sherry starts to feel sick and passes out. Furthermore, a large claw strikes through the tram only just missing Sherry. Claire leaves Sherry in the tram while she investigates outside.[CR]Upon investigating the tram platform, the monstrous William Birkin jumps from atop the tram after further mutating. Claire does battle with the monster and is able to force him to collapse and bleed out. The tram then arrives at its destination; from there Claire takes Sherry to the receptionist office of the lab. Giving Sherry her biker jacket ''for protection'', Claire leaves Sherry in the office while she goes on to explore the lab.Claire handing over her jacket to Sherry[CR]Claire eventually bumps into Annette Birkin once more, who proclaims that Sherry may have been infected by William in his attempt to create offspring. However William himself ambushes Annette; Annette, who has been slowly driven insane, tries to embrace what used to be her husband, but is viciously murdered by him. Claire is able to locate a file detailing the creation of the cure Sherry needs. Entering William's own lab, she is able to create the cure to eliminate the infection. With the cure in hand, the self-destruct mechanism also goes into motion. Unlocking all doors, this also opens up the emergency exit. After radioing Leon to bring Sherry to the emergency exit, Claire goes on the move to meet them.[CR]After locating the elevator that'll take her down to the escape train, William Birkin bursts through the wall above and mutates even further. Now taking the form of a kind of huge canine creature, it attacks Claire. With a five minute timer ticking down, Claire is once again able to defend herself against Birkin. As it begins to decompose, Claire boards the elevator. The train has already begun to move, with Leon shouting for Claire to jump on. She does so and administers the cure to Sherry; it works, providing relief for both Claire and Leon.Leon S. KennedyLeon exploring the police precinct[CR]After escaping the wreckage, Leon finds himself much closer to the police station than Claire and enters via the back. Upon entering the station, however, a helicopter can be seen trying to rescue a police officer. However zombies arrive and begin to feast on the officer, all the while he erratically begins to fire his submachine gun, killing the pilot and forcing him to crash.[CR]Making his way past the destruction and entering the station, another helicopter soon arrives, but instead drops a large container containing the Umbrella created Tyrant T-103. It slowly begins to walk towards Leon and attacks him, forcing Leon to kill it.[CR]Amidst his exploration, he encounters a small girl who quickly runs away. He gives chase, but she escapes via a small hole in the wall. Heading back down to the corridor he is reunited with Claire. Leon hands her a radio so they can keep in contact, while stating that they must search for fellow survivors and escape the city. Claire agrees, and the two split-up once more.[CR]Heading down to the station's car lot Leon is shot at by a woman, though she misses. She apologises after mistaking him for a zombie and introduces herself as Ada Wong. She is searching for her boyfriend John. Leon offers to help, and the two are then able to push a parked truck out of the way so as to gain access to the station's jail quarters.[CR]From there they meet Ben Bertolucci, a journalist who was investigating corruption within the RPD and is a contact of Ada's. He has purposely locked himself in a jail cell to help provide protection from the zombies and other monsters roaming the station. In a bid to help them escape the city, he suggests that their best bet would be the sewers. Ada then rushes off on her own.Ada &amp; Leon meeting Ben Bertolucci[CR]Leon attempts to catch up to Ada via the sewers and suggests they work together. Noticing a crawlspace up top, Ada asks Leon to give her a boost to investigate. He complies, and allows Ada to go off on her own. Upon entering through the crawlspace she encounters a small girl. The surprise forces the girl to drop her pendant and run away. Ada collects the pendant, and upon opening it up notices a small vial containing a purple substance.[CR]Ada locates some supplies to which she throws through the crawlspace to Leon, but then opts to head off on her own as she can't reach the crawlspace from her end. Nearby is a door that leads further into the sewers, only it's locked with a strange chess piece puzzle mechanism. Leon explores the station for the pieces required, though throughout his travels he is continually hounded by the T-103 tyrant. Leon is able to successfully defend himself each time, though it still continues to show up despite the damage it is dealt.[CR]Upon returning to the underground Leon hears Ben scream in terror. Arriving to his aid, he notices Ben bloodied and battered. Ben gives Leon evidence incriminating Chief Brian Irons' involvement with the Umbrella Corporation, and the corporation's nefarious schemes. Ben shortly dies from his injuries.[CR]Returning to the locked chess piece door, Leon encounters what looks to be a man. The man then begins to mutate and grow a large eye into his right arm. He then pulls off a pipe and begins to slowly advance towards Leon. Leon is able to do enough damage to the monster to force it to fall over the edge into the sewers below.[CR]Unlocking the door and entering the sewers himself, Leon again encounters Ada. He scolds her for running away and asks that they stick together. Ada complies, stating she'll ''do things your way, for now''. The two continue through the sewers, however after heading down an elevator Ada notices a female scientist. She chases after her but the scientist begins firing; Leon then quickly dives in front of Ada, while being shot in the process. He falls unconscience while the scientist runs away. Ada then gives chase.[CR]Finally managing to catch up to her, the scientist shoots Ada's weapon out of her hand and identifies herself as Annette Birkin. She tells of Umbrella's betrayal of she and her husband William Birkin, and how William injected himself with his own G-Virus after an attack on his life by Umbrella Security Service agents. The G-Virus turned him into a monster as he soon slaughtered the U.S.S. agents, minus one -- HUNK. This attack let loose many T-Virus vials, which were feasted on by rats. This then set into motion the T-Virus infection of Raccoon City.The T-103 Tyrant advancing unto Leon[CR]After discovering that the woman she is talking to is Ada Wong, she coldly states that her boyfriend John is dead and became a zombie. Being aware of her true intentions, Annette then attempts to kill Ada; the two engage in a struggle, with Ada slapping Annette forcing her to fall over the edge of the railing. Ada attempts to grab her hand, but to no avail and sarcastically responds with ''too bad''.[CR]Leon manages to wake up and goes after Ada despite his injuries. Finding her nearby to where she fought with Annette, she thanks Leon for his bravery in saving her from being shot and patches up his bullet wound. She also shares with him her discovery of John's fate, and asks that they get out of here.[CR]The two continue through the sewers until locating a tram, which takes them toward an abandoned Umbrella factory. There they encounter another tram, only this one stays motionless on a platform that descends down to Umbrella' secret laboratory. However as it descends, William Birkin attacks the two. He first strikes through the tram's wall, managing to graze Ada and knocking her out. Leon then heads outside and does battle with William and is once more able to defeat him.[CR]Returning to the tram Ada has awoken, although the tram has stopped midway and hasn't managed to reach the lab. Leon suggests that Ada should stay and rest while he looks for a way to kickstart the tram. After climbing through the vents, however, the tram inconveniently begins to work and continues its descent with Ada still inside. With no other alternative but to make his way down, Leon is able to restore power to the area and the nearby elevator, and use it to reach the lab. Noticing the tram, Leon enters but finds that Ada has disappeared.[CR]Leon will eventually come into contact with Annette Birkin, who while holding him at gunpoint states that Ada is in fact a spy and is trying to acquire the G-Virus. Leon doesn't believe her, though Annette doesn't seem to care either way as she then prepares to kill him. Just before she pulls the trigger, the T-103 tyrant arrives on the scene, forcing Annette to run away. Leon is able to once again deal enough damage to temporarily down the creature, and tries to find Ada.Ada &amp; Leon's embrace[CR]Heading towards the power room, Leon is again ambushed by the T-103 tyrant. Only this time Ada arrives for assistance and tries to gain its attention to save Leon. The tyrant does so and grabs her; Ada manages to shoot it in the face, however, forcing it to toss Ada away at a large machine console before it accidentally falls into a vat of molten liquid below.[CR]The collision between Ada and the machine dealt enough damage that it instigated the self-destruct sequence. Leon rushes to Ada, who appears to be dying, and the two share an intimate kiss before she bleeds out.[CR]Leon soon receives a radio call from Claire, asking him to retrieve Sherry from the receptionist office. He does so, and takes the elevator down to the emergency escape train, which has become accessible due to the self-destruct sequence. He lets Sherry rest on the tram and then heads back out to turn on the power. Upon doing so, however, the T-103 tyrant arrives, having gone through a severe mutation that has given it two large claws and made to be much more aggressive. The battle occurs in the midst of a five minute timer, with Leon just barely able to defend himself until a silhouette of what looks to be Ada drops him a rocket launcher.[CR]Leon picks up the rocket launcher and fires it at the tyrant, destroying it completely. Making his return to the train now that it is powered, he turns on the train. As it begins to pick up speed, Claire arrives and jumps onto the train just in the nick of time. She quickly administers a cure for Sherry, who was infected by William, which appears to take effect and heal her. With the ordeal behind them, Leon heads to the driver's compartment and says his goodbye to Ada.[CR]However the train quickly rumbles as an alarm sounds. Leon heads back to Claire and Sherry asking what's going on, and heads to investigate the other compartments. Reaching the very end of the train, William Birkin--now an amorphous blob--pours onto the train and slowly slithers towards Leon. With the door locked behind him as a precautionary measure put into effect by the train, Leon is forced to unload everything he has into the monster. After enough punishment it begins to disintegrate, as the door also conveniently unlocks behind Leon.William Birkin's final form[CR]While on his way to return to Claire, William Birkin strikes back into action, forcing all three characters to split-up. Claire is left hanging off the bottom of the train, Leon crawls across the top, and Sherry rushes to the driver's compartment. Leon is then able to reach the driver's compartment and tell Sherry to turn on the emergency brake. She does so, allowing the three to reunite and quickly run out of the tunnel before the train self-destructs.[CR]With the nightmare finally over with, the three rest their weary legs. But only before Claire rises up again and states that she still has to find her brother Chris.Epilogue[CR]As first detailed in Claire's unlockable epilogue file in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Leon opposes Claire's idea to quickly rush into action so soon to find her brother. Insulted that she opts to abandon them for the sake of her brother, Leon tells her to go and that they [Leon &amp; Sherry] don't need her help. Claire understands that they require medical attention, yet sets out anyway, while promising that she'll return one day.Alternate Scenarios[CR]While Claire A &amp; Leon B is the canon ordering, players can still alternatively play through the opposite sequence, where Leon in fact heads through the entrance and Claire enters from the back. This then switched certain character roles, such as Claire coming into conflict with the T-103 Tyrant, and Leon encountering the characters of Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh. Though the results are the same, there are certain character fates that differ slightly during this ordering of the Scenarios:Leon ALeon upon first entering the Raccoon Police Station during his A Scenario Leon first reunites with Claire in the STARS office.Ben Bertolucci dies by being infected with a parasitic larvae that bursts out of his chest.Leon will alert Claire that the underground carpark and jail department is now accessible.Ada is left to rest in the receptionist office much like Sherry was.After learning of her true nature, Ada Wong holds Leon at gunpoint and demands he hand over the G-Virus vial he collected from Annette. However after letting down her guard after a short talk, she is then shot in the chest by Annette and ultimately falls over the edge of the walkway.Annette then passes out due to her injuries from a couple of pipes landing on her head after the self-destruct mechanism was initiated.Claire BClaire first reunites with Leon in the STARS office.Brian Irons dies by being pulled down a ladder by William and then torn in half.While Sherry still accidentally falls through the sewer grate, she isn't infected with the parasitic larvae and reunites with Claire at the factory tram.Claire first meets Annette as she clambers out of the sewers, barely able to talk, and then passes out. She is thusly not able to detail the origins of the T-Virus outbreak in the city and William Birkin's transformation.Sherry is left in the descending tram much like Ada was.Claire notices Sherry cornered by the T-103 tyrant on a CCTV monitor. Annette also arrives and states that Sherry's pendant houses a G-Virus vial, which is what the tyrant is after.After rescuing Sherry from the tyrant, they then encounter Annette lying on the floor, badly wounded after the pipes landed on her head. She apologises to Sherry for not being a good mother, and then dies from her injuries.At the very end, Leon will instead get up and state that it's up to them to take down Umbrella.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Combat Knife[CR]A starting weapon for both Leon &amp; Claire, the knife is traditionally a last resort tactic and even then the player should probably choose to run away instead. It does minimal damage, has a short reach of attack, and the player may often accidentally have it collide with the scenery leaving the player vulnerable for a second.[CR]Leon &amp; Claire each use the knife differently, with Leon choosing to jab it as opposed to Claire's swipe -- which may have been taught to her by Chris given that it's a similar method as to how he used his.H&amp;K VP70[CR]Leon's starting handgun, the H&amp;K is a reliable enough pistol, though because of its slow rate of fire and lack of stopping power, it's best restricted for lesser enemies such as zombies and zombie dogs. It may be useful for conserving ammo for better weaponry when there's enough distance, but it's otherwise still not very reliable against the larger enemies of the game.Maximum Ammo Count - 18 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.H&amp;K VP70 Burst[CR]An upgraded version of Leon's handgun that now offers the choice between single shot or a three-shot burst fire. While it has no increase in overall power, the burst fire gives it a boost in stopping power and damage output, however because of its faster rate of fire ammo may begin to dwindle quicker than expected. The items required to upgrade it are located within a locked drawer that requires a generic small key to open.Maximum Ammo Count - 18 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.Browning HP[CR]Claire Redfield's starting handgun that she collects from the glove box of a police cruiser. It is slightly stronger in power to Leon's H&amp;K, though it can only hold 13 bullets at a time. Its stopping power is also still very low so it is again best restricted for the lesser enemies of the game. Unlike Leon's, Claire's cannot be upgraded.[CR]Ada Wong is also shown to be equipped with this pistol, only she has a slightly different firing stance than Claire and is able to fire it more effectively with a faster rate of fire.Maximum Ammo Count - 13 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.Colt Single Action Army[CR]An unlockable weapon exclusive to Claire, the Colt S.A.A. has six shots and is fired from the hip. It has an extremely high rate of fire and more stopping power than any other handgun in the game. Though because of its rate of fire, ammo may begin to dwindle quicker as a result, as will reloads be more necessary -- players can still choose to reload via their inventory menu, however.Maximum Ammo Count - 6 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.S.T.A.R.S. Beretta 92FS Custom[CR]The best pistol in the game, this weapon is exclusive to Chris Redfield in the Extreme Battle minigame (see below to Unlockables). Because of Chris' expertise with handguns, it has a faster rate of fire than other handguns (though it isn't faster than the Colt) and has a high chance to score a critical hit against zombies and pop their head akin to a magnum.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.Remington Shotgun[CR]A shotgun exclusive to Leon, and what'll likely be a solid contender for boss battles for most players across the game. As is custom with video game shotguns the remington is very powerful at close-range, but has a slow rate of fire and its damage output decreases the further away an enemy is.[CR]It can be used to completely destroy a zombie's head or legs whence a player aims up or down respectively if one is close enough. There is also the chance that a zombie's torso will fall off after being shot and will then proceed to crawl towards the player. Players will commonly first encounter the shotgun at the very beginning of A Scenario, though there is another one located in the locker of the S.T.A.R.S. office. This is so players can still collect a shotgun whilst also attempting to trigger the Brad Vickers zombie (see below at Unlockables).Maximum Ammo Count - 5 rounds.Ammunition - 12 gauge shells.Remington Shotgun (Upgraded)[CR]Later in the game the player will come upon ''shotgun parts'', that when combined with the basic remington will upgrade it with a stock and longer barrel. This will increase the weapon's power significantly and allow it to hold more rounds, however the recoil is also drastically increased.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 rounds.Ammunition - 12 gauge shells.Bowgun[CR]A crossbow misnamed due to a localization era as a 'bowgun', this is essentially the shotgun equivalent for Claire Redfield. It functions similarly as it shoots out three bolts at once and does a fair amount of damage. However unlike the shotgun the bowgun is powerful at any range so long as the bolts hit, but the overall damage isn't as high. It has a decent amount of stopping power and can push back certain enemies the amount of force is so high. Some enemies such as crows can even get stuck to a wall by a bolt when shot.[CR]Like Leon's shotgun, the bowgun will often be first encountered during the beginning of A Scenario, though there exists another in the S.T.A.R.S. office locker.Maximum Ammo Count - 18 bolts.Ammunition - Bolts.Grenade Launcher[CR]Besides secret weapons, the grenade launcher is Claire's most powerful firearm and is a popular weapon to use against boss monsters. Much like the bazooka from the original, there are multiple grenade types available: grenade, fire, and acid. Grenade is the stock ammunition and deals heavy explosive damage; fire does less damage overall but is especially powerful against certain enemies like plants; and acid also does less base damage but has the benefit of a splash radius and deals continuous damage over time.[CR]One convenient quirk is the weapon's ability to carry as much ammo as possible, so long as it's one grenade type. When changing grenade types the specific grenade type will also stack together and will only take up one space regardless of how much ammo it carries.Maximum Ammo Count - N/AAmmunition - Grenade, Fire, and Acid rounds.Desert Eagle Magnum[CR]An incredibly powerful magnum-pistol that is exclusive to Leon. Besides secret weapons, this is undoubtedly Leon's most effective weapon amongst his arsenal. It is suitable for most enemies and bosses across the game, and will notably destroy a zombie's head completely whence shot with it.Maximum Ammo Count - 8 rounds.Ammunition - 50. caliber rounds.Desert Eagle Magnum (Upgraded)[CR]Much like the shotgun, the player can find magnum parts that once combined with the magnum will increase the weapon's barrel significantly. It now does even more damage, but it also now suffers from a significant increase in recoil.Maximum Ammo Count - 8 rounds.Ammunition - 50. caliber rounds.Submachine Gun[CR]A fully-automatic firearm, the submachine gun is effective at keeping enemies stunlocked, though the actual damage output isn't especially high. There are two submachine guns across the game, though there is no additional ammo to collect for either. The first is encountered in a weapon's locker during Scenario A; the player could take it then and there, or leave it for the alternate character to collect during Scenario B.[CR]The second is located in an Umbrella Lab. To access it, however, requires each character of Scenarios A &amp; B to register their handprint, and then place their hand on the door's scanner. It as such is only accessible for the Scenario B character to collect. This weapon takes up two slots within a character's inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100%, with roughly 3 bullets counting as 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Spark Shot[CR]A weapon exclusive to Claire, the Spark Shot is an unorthodox weapon that fires electrical charges. Like the submachine gun it requires two free slots to carry and its ammunition is represented with a percentage -- no additional ammo can be found. Its effectiveness isn't especially great, however, though it may prove useful against crowds due to the charge passing through all within close vicinity.Maximum Ammo Count - 100%, with each charge representing 2%.Ammunition - N/A.Flamethrower[CR]A weapon of limited use, the flamethrower is exclusive to Leon and takes up two inventory slots. Its ammo is also represented by percentage. Its primary use is against the mutant plants the player will encounter amidst the Umbrella Lab, as they are extremely resistant against most other forms of damage. However beyond that it is weak and deals little damage -- its fuel also rapidly runs out, and like other two slot weapons has no additional ammo to spare.Maximum Ammo Count - 100%, with each second of flame output representing 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Gatling Gun[CR]A secret weapon that is only used by unlocking it with infinite ammo. It requires players to complete each set of a Scenario A &amp; B with at least an A rank, and will then reside within the Scenario A's item box as well the Scenario B's whence Scenario A has been completed again. Though while it has a bit of a build up, it can rip through everything with enough time.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - N/A.Rocket Launcher[CR]Within a narrative-context the rocket launcher is used to destroy the mutated T-103 tyrant during Scenario B, though like the gatling gun can be unlocked with infinite ammo under the same requirements. It can kill nearly every enemy and boss in the game besides William Birkin in his canine form and his shapeless blob form.Maximum Ammo Count - 2Ammunition - N/A[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Zombies[CR]Like the original, zombies function as the most common enemy encountered throughout Resident Evil 2. Though they have a more varied set of animations, and there is a greater variety of models now too -- which includes the series' debut of female zombies.[CR]Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.[CR]Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick. Zombies also have a slight chance of splitting in two after being shot with a shotgun. Their torso will collapse onto the ground and will then proceed to crawl towards the player, though if the player leaves the area the torso will be gone the next time the player returns.Zombie Dogs[CR]Returning from the original game are zombie hounds, only these are of accidental infection and aren't the specifically designed Cerberus B.O.W.s. Though they otherwise function very much the same, and are likewise always encountered in packs. They contain the same agility and brutality as a standard dog, though are easy to stunlock as any shot from even a pistol will knock them off balance; continued shots will be able to keep them locked to the ground until death.Crows[CR]Much like most Resident Evil iterations, Crows only act as more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They are always found to be in a large number, however, and can be very hard to avoid.[CR]They only have one attack by way of pecking at the player, which while does little damage will keep the player stuck in a short animation of trying to wave them off.Licker[CR]An advanced mutation of zombies, mostly recognizable for their long tongue and claws. Lickers are extremely agile and fast, have an attack that can commit an instant-kill against the player, and can withstand more damage than the typical zombie. Lickers also have the added advantage of being able to climb up and rest upon flat surfaces, including ceilings. However they often tend to make a breathy growl of sorts, that along with the squishy noise of their movements makes them easy to pick up should one be close by.[CR]A licker usually takes between 2-3 shotgun or crossbow attacks to kill one. Though because of their lack of sight, players can potentially avoid encounters with one should they walk past rather than run. However if a player gets close enough, a Licker will always catch on to their presence and give chase regardless of their movement speed. While they can sometimes be encountered alone, they will more often than not be found in groups of at least two.[CR]Their attacks often involve their claws; they will swipe the player's leg when close, and when encountered at a distance will give off a loud shriek and then leap through the air in an attempt to maul the player. They will alternatively strike with their tongue and attempt to strangle the player; if the player's health is in the Caution state, there's a high chance the Licker will rip off the player's head completely.Evolved Licker[CR]This is a tougher variant of the Licker that'll be encountered later in the game. They are of a noticeably different shade of color from the regular red Lickers, with a more murky green color to them. They utilize the same attacks as a regular Licker, however they will deal--and can withstand--more damage.Web Spinners[CR]Much like zombie hounds, these are to be found in nearly every Resident Evil game to date. They are primarily just spiders, though they all also have the ability to poison the player with a gush of poison spit.[CR]Ordinarily should a giant spider die with its sack still intact, hundreds of miniature spiders would begin to seep out and attack the player. However for whatever reason this is not the case in Resident Evil 2.Plant 43[CR]A smaller, smarter iteration off of Plant 42 from the original Resident Evil. Though while significantly smaller in size, they are still quite resistant to most forms of damage. However they are terribly weak against fire. They primarily attack by spewing a gob of acid at the player from their gaping mouth, though they especially dangerous up close as they will grapple and trap the player with their vines while pouring their acid all over them.[CR]There is another variant of the creature that's acid will also poison the player should it hit. They are otherwise the same, and are visually distinctive by their 'head' being of a red color as opposed to green.Giant Moth[CR]While there is only one to be found in the game, the giant moth isn't technically a boss battle. It is encountered within an Umbrella lab and has grown itself a nest. It attacks the player by charging towards them, or spitting poison. While it still has its wings, it is not strong enough to fly very efficiently and can only hover. It is nonetheless quite sturdy and requires around 4 shots from an upgraded desert eagle magnum to down.[CR]It's also worth noting that it is completely optional to fight, and is only necessary should players desire to register their handprint to access the locked laboratory door.[CR]Boss Battles[CR]G[CR]The first boss encountered in Scenario A, G was once a small parasitic larvae that was implanted by the mutated William Birkin into either Ben Bertolucci or Brian Irons, depending on which character's story it is. After an allotted time, however, it grows into a much larger, more humanoid creature.[CR]It is slow in speed, so its primary source of attack is to vomit out several small larvae to then seek out the player and attempt to force themselves down their throat. Otherwise it can punch the character when close enough, but the primary tactic is to keep a good distance and keep shooting at it, while also trying to shoot any of the swarming larvae on the ground. After enough damage it will ultimately disintegrate.Giant Alligator[CR]This aptly titled boss is encountered in the sewers. It will surprise attack the player from beneath the sewage water and slowly makes its way through the tunnel; its size means it is impossible to run past it. There are two methods to killing it: first is the basic path of simply unloading whatever the player has into the creature; alternatively the player could drop the gas canister that resides within the middle of the tunnel, and then shoot it once the alligator picks it up with its mouth killing it instantly. If players choose to kill it the old fashioned way, there will be a small stash of ammunition awaiting them next to the tram later in the game.[CR]The alligator will always be fought in Scenario A, however if it is killed via the gas canister it will stay dead for the alternate character's Scenario B. Otherwise it must be fought again in much the same way, complete with the gas canister still available; it will also visually be shown wounded to account for the previous battle.T-103 'Mr. X'[CR]A mass-produced successor to the T-102 from Resident Evil, the T-103 is only encountered during Scenario B. It is encountered multiple times throughout at scripted moments in the story, often bursting through walls or ambushing from around a corner. A clear way to note if it is about to arrive is if the theme music for the area has stopped.[CR]It is usually designed to block the player from progressing, forcing them to kill it before it reaches them. Though it will always walk, and when attacked with a powerful enough weapon such as a shotgun will slow down even further. If it gets close its attacks will do a noticeable amount of damage and can potentially kill the player with only about 4 attacks. It will only use its fists to attack, usually using a hook punch to knock the player back as a method of again forcing players to fight it. Though it will also sometimes do an overhead smash with both hands clasped together -- its most powerful attack.[CR]After enough damage has been dealt it will begin to slightly sway before toppling to the floor. Searching its body afterwards will gift the player some ammunition.T-103 Mutated Form[CR]Upon inadvertently falling into a vat of molten liquid, the tyrant will re-emerge now mutated and of a completely different boss design. It is only fought once nearing the end, again only during Scenario B, shortly after the player is powering up the escape train. Its trademark jacket has now completely burnt away, revealing a growth in mass, as has its hands formed into large claws.[CR]It is now considerably faster and will frequently rush and slash at the player. Its attacks are thusly difficult to avoid, likely forcing most players to simply brute force their way through the fight and hope they have enough healing supplies. Upon enough damage, from around 4-5 upgraded magnum shots for reference, a silhouette of Ada Wong will arrive to drop the player--as either Leon or Claire--a rocket launcher.[CR]The player must then quickly rush and equip it, and then fire at the tyrant -- one shot is all it will take to destroy it.William Birkin First Form[CR]Upon injecting himself with the G-virus, William Birkin has now transformed into a horrible monstrosity -- one that grows more hideous as the game progresses. Similar to the T-103 he is thusly fought multiple times throughout the game, though each time is a different form, and unlike the T-103 is fought across both Scenarios. Though his first is only fought during Scenario B, in place of where players faced 'G' in Scenario A.[CR]His first form is his most comparatively mundane, as he still retains many of his human physical qualities. Though he still has access to incredible strength, and will pull off a nearby pipe which will govern his attacks. He is slow moving, similar to G, and will primarily swing the pipe around randomly -- any attack that hits does a significant amount of damage, however. Similar to G, the primary strategy is to keep at a distance and fire whatever the player has. He can withstand a fair amount of damage, roughly taking about eight grenade rounds. Once enough damage has been inflicted, the boss theme will cut off and he will then seemingly accidentally fall over the edge into the sewers below.William Birkin Second Form[CR]This form is the point where Birkin now literally begins to shed his human qualities in favor of something more monstrous, and is the first William boss for Scenario A. After discarding his pipe, his right arm has grown into an enormous claw, now making him somewhat resemble a tyrant.[CR]The battleground is set on a tram platform descending down into Umbrella's underground laboratory. Birkin still only walks, but the arena is of a U shape, with the possibility of the player finding themselves at a dead end. Though area is also wide enough that players should be able to potentially rush past.[CR]Birkin of course now attacks with his claw, which has a slightly greater reach than the pipe but roughly does the same amount of damage. He will also take about the same amount of damage to down as before, so as long as players again keep their distance he will eventually begin bleeding and ultimately slump to the floor after receiving enough damage.William Birkin Third Form[CR]At this point William now resembles something more demonic than human, and has access to two equally large claws protruding from his shoulders along with what is now another pair of claws that were once his hands. This form is fought in the B Scenario on the same tram platform as his previous form was fought.[CR]He still only walks but each step will now cover more distance, allowing him to more quickly catch up to the player. His attacks also now have a much larger reach than before, and he will periodically enter a stance with all four of his claws raised up. If attacked amidst this stance he will unleash a powerful combo with all four claws and can potentially kill the player outright with this attack. If he isn't able to strike the player with this attack, after so long he will revert back to his default stance[CR]This form is naturally tougher than the last and can withstand even more damage. Though this time when the battle is over Birkin will leap away onto the wall rather than pass out.William Birkin Fourth Form[CR]The final boss of Scenario A, Birkin has how transformed into some sort of monstrous canine. His shoulder claws have morphed into his front legs, and he has grown considerably in mass with a large maw for a mouth.[CR]Now running on four 'legs', this form is his fastest by a great deal, and he will commonly rush at the player and grab them with its maw and shake the player around like a ragdoll. It won't kill the player outright but still does a high amount of damage.[CR]The arena offers two tall series of tubes, to which Birkin will occasionally jump onto, potentially allowing players some temporary safety and to get in some extra shots. Though it will eventually jump off and may also attack the player simultaneously.[CR]In traditional Resident Evil fashion, there is a 5 minute timer ticking down during the battle.William Birkin Final Form[CR]The final boss of Scenario B, William has ultimately become an amorphous blob of a creature, made up of a variety of eyes, teeth, claws, and assimilated corpses all over. Probably the simplest boss in the game, it exists more for spectacle than to serve as a challenge. Set on the cargo cart of the escape train, the player is trapped between a locked door and the slowly slithering horror that is now William Birkin.[CR]The player is simply tasking with unloading whatever they have into it from their position. At this point players should have access to a single shot left for their rocket launcher which, while it won't kill Birkin, will deal a fair bit of damage. After so much punishment Birkin begins to decompose, while the door conveniently unlocks behind the player allowing them to escape. Upon opening the door the game will end, switching to a CG cutscene showcasing Birkin's ultimate demise due to the self-destruction of the train -- after the characters themselves have escaped.[CR]Unlockables[CR]Like most Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 2 is packed with unlockable content to help supply replay value and prolong the game's lifespan.Ranking &amp; Unlockable WeaponsArt from Leon's results screen[CR]There is a ranking system dependent on how players finish the game. Ranks are determined by how fast the player finished the game, how many first aid sprays are used, and how often the player saved. The ranks range from D to S, with S being the best.[CR]To attain an S rank the player must complete the game under 2 hours, without using any first aid sprays and only saving once. Upon achieving an S rank, or even A rank, for both scenarios, the player will be rewarded with a submachine gun, a gatling gun, and a rocket launcher, all with infinite ammo, but only for the completed scenario pair. They will be awaiting in the item box should the player decide to play through the completed scenarios once more.CostumesOne of Leon's alternate costumes.[CR]S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team pilot Brad Vickers is killed by the B.O.W. monster Nemesis during Resident Evil 3. However because it is initially set before the events of Resident Evil 2, Brad is thusly given time to return in zombie form for Resident Evil 2.[CR]To locate him, players must head from the beginning of Scenario A to the Police Station without collecting any items -- not even the shotgun/bowgun that drops from Robert Kendo. Upon successfully reaching the station, the Brad Vickers zombie will be wandering below in the underpass. He can withstand more punishment than a regular zombie, though an upward shot to the head with the shotgun will still kill him instantly as like any other. Whence killed, his corpse will yield a key that will unlock a locker in the station's darkroom. In it are costumes for Leon and Claire.Claire wearing her alternate biker outfit[CR]Leon unlocks two different outfits, whereas Claire only unlocks one. However Claire is instead gifted a six-shot revolver exclusive to her, to tie in with the cowgirl theme of her alternate costume. Leon, while he doesn't obtain a new weapon, will now wield handguns sideways with one hand; this stance then gives Leon increased firing speed with handguns, though can be only be used while wearing one of the alternate costumes. Should players modify Leon's H&amp;K handgun, however, he will lose the stance in favor of the burst-fire.[CR]The N64 version has one additional exclusive costume per character.[CR]If players manage to trigger the appearance of zombie Brad in Scenario A, he will then show up once again in the same location in the alternate character's Scenario B without any other prerequisites.The 4th Survivor4th Survivor title screen[CR]A small side-story starring U.S.S. agent H.U.N.K., after he was able to escape the clutches of the mutated William Birkin, can be unlocked via attaining at least a rank A for either set of an A &amp; B scenario.[CR]Beginning at the entrance to the station's sewers, it tasks players as H.U.N.K. to make it to the RPD helipad for extraction. However H.U.N.K.s supplies are limited, and no more can be found amidst the story. Furthermore, all of the enemies from the main game make an appearance, including two appearances of the Mr. X tyrant.[CR]H.U.N.K.s inventory is as such:H&amp;K Pistol.150 spare 9mm bullets.Remington Shotgun.15 spare shells.Desert Eagle Magnum.8 spare magnum bullets.Mixed herb made up of a single green &amp; blueMixed herb made up of a single green &amp; blue.And in his unique inventory slot is the G-Virus vial he successfully stole from William Birkin.[CR]As such, players are to choose wisely as to what to use against what enemies, as there are many more enemies in the player's path than they have bullets. Upon reaching the helipad it shows H.U.N.K. signalling for his escape chopper and flying away. In all ports from the Dualshock version onward, a timer will tick up showing how long it took the player to finish.[CR]The mini-story's title is somewhat inconsistent with the amount of characters whom actually survive, with Leon, Claire, Sherry, and Ada also eventually being revealed to have escaped making H.U.N.K. the technically 5th survivor of Resident Evil 2.The Tofu SurvivorTofu Survivor title screen; Tofu is unfortunately not shown to wear Jill's beret in-game[CR]A parody of The 4th Survivor minigame, Tofu Survivor plays near identical, only instead of controlling H.U.N.K. players instead take control of a sentient piece of Japanese tofu. This mode is unlocked upon attaining at least an A rank for all four scenarios.[CR]The objective is the exact same as The 4th Survivor, as is the enemy placements, however the character of Tofu only but has a combat knife to defend itself with. It does also have some additional herbs, however, and it is noticeably sturdier than the other characters in the game. Nonetheless, The Tofu Survivor is arguably the toughest minigame in the main Resident Evil series.[CR]Because of the lack of reliable weaponry on hand, players are to instead attempt to avoid most encounters, using such tactics as the fan-coined ''wall hug'' of running diagonally into a wall to attempt to pass enemies. Completing the minigame yields the same ending as The 4th Survivor, and this too features a timer to help clock how long it took players to complete from the Dualshock version onward.[CR]The mode itself originated as a joke by the developers, after they would use the Tofu character model to help in designing collision detection.Extreme BattleExtreme Battle title screen[CR]The third and final minigame of Resident Evil 2, Extreme Battle is something more of a score-focussed mode, complete with multiple characters and difficulty levels -- 3 in total. It is unlocked upon completing either set of A &amp; B scenarios. It is only available in certain ports of Resident Evil 2, however.[CR]Players are tasked in trying to locate four ''anti-virus bombs'' within the Raccoon Police Station--the specific locations of the bombs are randomized--though they first begin at Umbrella's laboratory near the end of the story. Players are to choose from four different characters to determine their equipment, although only two are available at the outset; the other two must be unlocked by climbing up the difficulty levels. Unlike the previous modes, players can locate more supplies amidst their travels and can even save their progress with an ink ribbon &amp; typewriter like in the main game.[CR]There are leaderboards available that'll track how long it took for the player to complete which level, and with which character. However players can only strive to beat the pre-entered scores or their own, as there is no online functionality across any of the ports.Characters[CR]Leon S. KennedyH&amp;K PistolRemington ShotgunDesert Eagle MagnumInk RibbonFirst Aid SprayBlue Herb[CR]Claire RedfieldGrenade LauncherFlame RoundsAcid RoundsInk RibbonFirst Aid SprayBlue Herb[CR]Ada Wong[CR]Is unlocked upon completing Level 1.Colt PistolSubmachine gunBow GunInk RibbonMixed herb, made up of a green, red, and blue.[CR]Chris Redfield[CR]The original hero from Resident Evil, Chris is unlocked upon completing Level 2. His STARS beretta pistol is exclusive to him and has a chance to pop a zombie's head similar to the magnum. Because of Chris' experience, he can handle the recoil of the upgraded shotgun more so than Leon, giving it less kickback. The sound effects related to Chris receiving damage are recycled from the original Resident Evil.Beretta PistolRemington Shotgun (Upgraded Version)Rocket LauncherInk RibbonFirst Aid SprayLevels[CR]Each of the three levels gets progressively harder from one to the next, by introducing new enemies (including William Birkin in his canine form) and remixing old enemy placements, to decreasing the amount of available supplies to collect out in the world.[CR]Version Differences[CR]Resident Evil 2 (Sony PlayStation)[CR]The original version of Resident Evil 2 released on January 21, 1998 in North America. One week later, Biohazard 2 would be released in Japan. The content was spread across two discs and featured considerable improvements to the mechanics and graphics from the preceding Resident Evil (see "Gameplay" section above).[CR]Supposedly, the Japanese release was considerably easier than its North American counterpart, featuring different item placement, better firepower and auto-aim enabled by default. Additionally, the Japanese version did not include scenes of player characters being eaten by zombies after death and gore was diminished along with some violent depictions.Resident Evil 2: DualShock Version (Sony PlayStation)[CR]Virtually the same as the original PlayStation version, but with added functionality to accept the DualShock Controller released after the game's original release date. The game featured vibration functions and analog controls. This release also saw the addition of Extreme Battle, an unlockable mini game where the player needs to reach the police station and find four anti-biohazard bombs. Also, a cheat code for unlimited ammo was added.[CR]The Japanese DualShock version featured a "USA Version" mode, bringing the difficulty up to par with its overseas counterpart; this release also had feature parity with the North American version and sported the same add-ons and DualShock-only functions. The violence scenarios and gore, however, still remained censored, edited or omitted.[CR]In 2009, the DualShock Version was released on the PlayStation Store at a $5.99 price point and is compatible with both the PlayStation 3 and PSP.Resident Evil 2 Platinum (Windows '98 PC)[CR]Contained the same content as the PlayStation releases, except the Dualshock Version's mini games were unlocked from the start. The game was spread across two CD-ROMs.Resident Evil 2 (Nintendo 64)[CR]After commercial success on the PlayStation, Capcom commissioned Angel Studios (later renamed to Rockstar San Diego) to create an Nintendo 64 port. The PlayStation original, however, had over 700MB of data spread across its two discs and the highest capacity for a Nintendo 64 cartridge was a comparatively tiny 64MB (512 Mbit). Despite the software media limitations, the N64 port was comparable to the PlayStation version with the omission of the DualShock Version's Extreme Battle mini game. This version also added additional documents called EX files, which referenced numerous plot details and Resident Evil Zero, which at that time was still in development for the N64 before being moved over to the GameCube later on.[CR]Thanks to the Nintendo 64's additional 4MB of RAM added by the (optional) Expansion Pak, the game displayed at a higher resolution at times, switching between 640x480 and 320x240 (the PlayStation version's native resolution) depending on how many enemies were in the area. If the player defeated the enemies, then the game would automatically switch to the higher resolution. Without the Expansion Pak, the game's visuals closely resembled the PlayStation original.[CR]Audio from this version suffered the most compression despite the addition of surround sound (which was absent from previous releases). All content fit on one cartridge and did not force players to switch between two different pieces of media.Biohazard 2 Value Plus (Sega Dreamcast)[CR]The Value Plus version is a Japanese-exclusive release that came out one year after the DualShock version and in the same year as the PC and N64 ports. It was bundled with a disc containing a demo of Resident Evil: Code Veronica and assorted music from various games in the series. Since the Dreamcast ran on a Windows CE operating system, this version of Resident Evil 2 was identical to the PC release (see above). However, if the player had a VMU, they could see their character's health on the display.Resident Evil 2 (Sega Dreamcast)[CR]Resident Evil 2 on Dreamcast in territories other than Japan is a two-GD ROM set with each disc being a campaign for the two characters, similar to the original PlayStation edition. The Dreamcast version is known for having no drops in the game's framerate and having higher resolution backgrounds than the Playstation, Nintendo 64 and GameCube versions. It also had an "Extra" option in the main menu that allowed the player to view concept art and in-game cutscenes. Like the Japanese version, if the player had a VMU, they were able to see their character's health status on the VMU screen.Biohazard 2 PC (Windows XP PC)[CR]The same as the PC version released in 1998, except now compatible with Windows XP machines and on one DVD-ROM with uncompressed 640x480 CG scenes. This particular version is a Japanese exclusive released in 2006. It's often referred to as BioHazard 2 SourceNext, after after the company responsible for re-releasing this versionResident Evil 2 (Nintendo Gamecube)[CR]Some note this as the definitive version of Resident Evil 2, and while it does not feature any of the EX files on N64, it comes complete with the Extreme Battle minigame. Although it did sport slightly better graphics, background resolutions were worse than the Dreamcast and PC versions. Minor differences such as the voice on the main menu are present. All content is available on one disc.[CR]Along with the release of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis on the Gamecube, this particular version is considered a rarity for the system because of low print run.[CR]Development[CR]Resident Evil 1.5Image of Elza equipped with a shotgun[CR]After the launch of Resident Evil, work immediately began on Resident Evil 2 and was scheduled for a 1997 release. Nearing the end of development, when the game was about 80-90% done, the creators felt the sequel was more of the same and was scrapped. The previous version of the game had a female protagonist named Elza Walker who was eventually replaced by Claire Redfield. She shared many of Claire&#8217;s traits such as being an avid fan of motorbikes and was a student. While Claire is the sister of the Chris Redfield, the Resident Evil 1.5 protagonist, Elza, was completely unrelated to any previous Resident Evil character. Leon Kennedy also had a radically different appearance initially, but that too was altered since Capcom believed it held too strong a resemblance to former Resident Evil hero Chris Redfield. Additionally, the policeman named Marvin who dies early on in Resident Evil 2 had a much bigger role in this incarnation; supposedly he would help the player escape the city similar to the role of Barry in Resident Evil 3.Ada in her original researcher outfit[CR]Furthermore, the design and layout of the police department was modern and resembled a typical police structure. It lacked the gothic elements of the final police station and used the color gray quite frequently; perhaps in a bid to make the area feel sterile. Finally, amongst other things, were the varieties of the monsters. Sketches and screenshots showcase zombies of different races, monsters that resembled the reapers from Resident Evil 5 and two bosses, which made the cutting room floor named Zeiram and Gorgoda. Zeiram and Gorgoda&#8217;s elements of design ultimately were used to create William Birkin&#8217;s G-form.[CR]The characters had unique and more professional animations for wielding weapons, such as Leon holding his gun up when standing still rather than continuing in his neutral stance.[CR]A version of the game that looks to be almost complete is in the confines of a private collection, but other than a 10 minute video of previously unseen footage posted on Youtube, nothing else has been released, much to the dismay of fans.[CR]Remake[CR]On August 12th, 2015, Capcom announced that they will be proceeding with a Resident Evil 2 Remake. No major details were provided, but it is presumed that the game will receive the same treatment as the Gamecube remake of Resident Evil.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Resident Evil 2 is the only mainline Resident Evil game that doesn't feature any idle animations.It was Hideki Kamiya's idea specifically to reintroduce Brad Vickers as a zombie.Ada Wong's CG character model wasn't finished, and is thusly the only character of the main four to not show up in any of the CG cutscenes.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]There are two soundtrack CD releases for Resident Evil 2, the first release came out in January 29, 1998 and consisted of 31 tracks and one CD. But since not all music contained in the game was included, a new version was release in August 21, 1998 named Biohazard 2 Complete Track and with 50 tracks and two CDs. The soundtrack was composed by Masami Ueda, Shun Nishigaki and Shusaku Uchiyama.Biohazard 2 Original SoundtrackBiohazard 2 Complete TrackCD 11. "The Beginning of Story"2. "Annette's Recollection"3.

		<title_clean>Road Rash 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Road Rash 64 is the fifth installment in the  Road Rash franchise and the only installment to come out for a  Nintendo home console. It is also the only Road Rash game not developed or published by  Electronic Arts.[CR]Keeping the same mantra of previous Road Rash games, races consist of high-speed motorcycles and violent battles among riders.[CR]The game was developed by  Pacfic Coast Power &amp; Light, published by  THQ and released on September 22, 1999. The initial development of the game was expected to be a port of  Road Rash 3D from the  Playstation (which had come out a year earlier), but ended up being a much more arcade-like experience focused on the battles between riders (with power-ups and more elaborate weapons) rather than the racing aspect that its Playstation brother was known for. While most reviewers found the gameplay to be highly enjoyable, the game's graphics were commonly regarded as "poor".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Going through a variety of locales, the object of the game is to win races and gain money to buy better motorcycles. Central to the racing is vehicular combat, where you can use either weapons or your bike to knock other riders off of their bikes. Weapons can be stolen from the attacker by hitting the attack button with no weapon equipped while being attacked by a rider with a weapon. Being knocked off your bike would result in a few seconds of delay before respawning. While the gameplay is very open and almost all areas are drivable, if you crash while cutting across the map, you will get a message "Cheaters never prosper" and are spawned at an undesirable spot of the road.[CR]Being hit results on your health bar going down, and losing all health would cause you to fall of your bike. Below that health bar is a bike health bar, crashing too many times will bring this bar down, and once it runs out you fail the race.[CR]Police will often chase you during races, at which point you can either knock them off their bikes or ignore them, however they do have powerful nightsticks that they will use to knock you off your bike. If a policeman knocks you off your bike, you are busted and lose the race.[CR]Races often have the opposing riders grouped into gangs that will help each other by knocking out other riders. Eventually you join a gang of your own, who do not hit you unless you hit them too often.[CR]Bonus Content[CR]A hidden game mode allows the player to race with scooters. While they may not be fast, it allows you to focus much more attention on attacking the AI, and the slower speed and ridiculous look of the riders on these bikes adds a comedic aspect to the races.[CR]The final bike that you can buy is extremely powerful and has a top speed of over 300 miles per hour. These bikes can only be raced on specific track layouts due to their power, listed as "Insanity" in the game. Accelerating too quickly will cause you to do a hard wheelie, often causing you to crash. The increased frequency of wrecks on these high-speed bikes typically will cause the player to "damage out" substantially faster than in the standard game types.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]At the main menu press:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite spikey clubs in Big Game mode.[CR]For some strange reason, if you type in the All weapons code (C up x4, c down, L, c left, z) and go into Big Game, you will have unlimited spiked clubs. This enables you to continually use them to jam people over and over until you turn the game off.</plot>

		<plot>Roadsters is a car racing game that features both licensed cars from manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, etc., and unlicensed cars from imaginary manufacturers that are based and bare great resemblance to their equivalent, real car models. The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total:[CR]1. Roadster Trophy  The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate;  the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in  possession.[CR]Multi-Player  Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.

		<title_clean>Robotech - Crystal Dreams</title_clean>
		<plot>Robotech: Crystal Dreams was a canceled Robotech video game for the Nintendo 64. The developer, GameTek filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before the game could be completed, and was subsequently liquidated. The game was announced on May 1995 as one of the first titles going to be released at the launch of the Nintendo 64 under the working title, Robotech Academy but was eventually cancelled days after being shown at the 1998 E&#179; trade show. Antarctic Press produced a promotional comic book that was handed out at E&#179; and is now considered a collectors item.[CR][edit] Game Play[CR]Crystal Dreams was primarily a space fighter simulation game, but between levels the player would return to base and be able to interact with a variety of other characters, the game also had a continuing war time line that the player could get reports of what was happening in various parts of space, and could help out by rushing to the aid of those that needed their help most.[1][CR][edit] Background[CR]The game was originally conceived as an ambitious title that involved rendering everything using models in real dimensions, with no background sprites making up the scenery. Planets and stars were all rendered in 3D and in perspective; this resulted in the entire rendered universe requiring six months of real time to traverse from one end to the other. The game was also going to include over 40 minutes of dialogue and featured open-ended gameplay, allowing the player to pick up missions and help the various organizations at his own discretion.[CR]Since work began on Crystal Dreams well before Nintendo finalised their console's hardware, Gametek were unsure on the amount of processing power the system would have and wanted to ensure they could have fast gameplay while having many enemies on screen at the same time. To ensure this, the team used very simple crystal models for the enemies and created a story based around them. Ultimately the low-resolution models were unnecessary, but the design and story had already been established.[CR]The resources and money required to produce a quality 3D title during this transitional period from 2D to 3D was not well understood and the project fell behind schedule. The game's original publisher pulled out, GameTek were unable to find another and did not have the capital to fund the project alone. The developers concede that their design was probably too ambitious, particularly from such a small company; Gametek had only three programmers. Despite this the developers hold the opinion that they only needed another six more months to bring the title to a beta stage before Gametek folded. Unfinished Nintendo 64 ROM images are available to download via the Crystal Dreams developers website.[CR][CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech:_Crystal_Dreams[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The retro shooter returns with the same addictive gameplay of the original arcade game, but now with the added power of the Nintendo 64.[CR]The aim of the game is simple. Shoot all the enemies on each grid while saving the humans from certain death. Power-ups and items can be picked up to increase your shooting and speed ability, and the further you go in the game, the more enemies attack and the more difficult it gets to save the humans.[CR]Options include the ability to plug in a second N64 controller for added control of the character on the game screen (i.e. two analog sticks). The brand new 3D engine, while sporting similar styled graphics that hark back to the 80's classic, also boasts fuller textures and greater mobility for the character.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]During Gameplay enter the following code:</plot>

		<title_clean>Rocket - Robot on Wheels</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Rocket: Robot On Wheels is a 3D platformer in the vein of   Donkey Kong 64 and   Super Mario 64 for the   Nintendo 64, and follows the adventures of a robot named Rocket. The game is notable for its   physics engine, and was the first game created by   Sucker Punch, the developers of the   Sly Cooper trilogy.   [CR]Premise[CR]Rocket belongs to a man named Dr. Gavin, who despite apparently having a doctorate, has spent his time designing and funding the construction of Whoopie World, a fantastical amusement park. As Gavin attends a party on the eve of the park's opening, Rocket is instructed to watch after the park's mascots. Hijinks ensue as Jojo the raccoon, one of the park's mascots, kidnaps the park's namesake mascot, Whoopie the walrus. Jojo escapes Rocket with a well placed mallet to the head and teleportsdown to the park, with Whoopie as his captive. Rocket gives chase and spends the rest of the game attempting to rescue Whoopie by collecting tickets and tokens while trying to fix the various machines of the park.Like any game that stars a robot in an amusement park, you spend a large portion of your time fighting classic enemies such as: out of control robots, evil robotic clowns, and giant robot bees. [CR]Rocket's Abilities[CR]At the start of the game, Rocket possesses very little in the way of abilities: only the knowledge of how to jump and how to hold onto objects with a tractor beam. Over the course of the game, Rocket can gain four special moves. Each move can be acquired by collecting a certain number of Tinker Tokens within the various game worlds before seeking out the repair bot Tinker at one of his many repair stations in Whoopie World. These abilities included:   Rocket's tractor beam: One of the game's unique features.Slam Jump (Use to slam/smash objects)   Rocket Jump (Double-Jump) Freeze Ray (Creates ice platforms in water and attacks enemies)   Grapple (Pick up objects at a distance and swing from distant objects) [CR]Collectibles[CR]Like many 3D platformers on the Nintendo 64, Rocket: Robot on Wheels was designed to include several different collectibles for the player to pick up along the course of the adventure, most of which were necessary for progressing through the game.   Tickets: Like   Super Mario 64's stars,   Banjo-Kazooie's Jiggies and   Donkey Kong's golden bananas, tickets can be collected within each of the game's worlds and are used to unlock later areas once enough have been collected. There are 12 tickets contained in each world for a total of 84 in the game, with most tickets attainable within the same trip inside a level if the player persists. Upon pausing the game, the player can select which tickets they are missing from the menu to gain a short clue on the ticket's whereabouts. Tinker Tokens: Similar to the   coins of Super Mario 64 or   notes of Banjo-Kazooie, there are a total of 200 Tinker Tokens to be collected within each level. Collect all 200 and the player gains a Ticket, although the secondary and perhaps more important use of the tokens is within the game's hub world, where they can be used to pay for new abilities and upgrades for Rocket. There are three varieties of Tinker Token - silver, gold and purple which earn you one, five and ten tokens respectively, in similar fashion to the different colored coins in Super Mario 64. Machine Parts: Collect each part within a world and return it to the machine's control panel to activate a machine. This gives Rocket a ticket and access to a new area that likely contains another ticket.  Booster Packs: These come in the form of a large, golden atom and are like the   extra honeycomb pieces in Banjo-Kazooie.  There are two in Whoopie World and one in all other levels. Picking one up will extend your health by one unit immediately. [CR]Vehicles[CR]One of Rocket's more unique additions is that of its vehicles. The player can use these contraptions to travel or solve puzzles. Each vehicle requires a certain number of Tinker Tokens to operate, and excluding Whoopie World, each world has at least one vehicle.    Dune Dog - The first vehicle of the game, located in Clowny Island. Requires 50 Tinker Tokens to operate. A   hot dog car which can be used to race around the island in high speed. Hoversplat - The first vehicle available in Paint Misbehavin'. Requires 125 Tinker Tokens. The Hoversplat hovers around the world and uses its   cannon to fire blobs of different colored paint at various objects. Finbot - The second vehicle of Paint Misbehavin'. Requires 175 Tokens. The dolphin-shaped Finbot allows Rocket to swim through water at top speeds. Beamlift - A strange monster truck shaped contraption used in Mine Blowing. Requires 325 Tokens. The Beamlift is equipped with more powerful version of Rocket's tractor beam, able to lift and shift large crates. No, the Shag Flyer does not help you pick up chicks.Shag Flyer - A   magic carpet with a vase on top for Rocket to sit in, found at the start of Arabian Flights. Requires 475 Tokens. The Shag Flyer can fly through the world, and use is practically mandatory to get anything done. Glider Bike - A motorcycle with retractable bat wings found in Pyramid Scheme. Requires 750 Tokens. The Glider Bike is arguably the most difficult vehicle to control in the game. Spider Rider - A spider-like boat found in Food Fright. Requires 850 Tokens. A spider vehicle with the ability to crawl over the top of extremely harmful liquids. [CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR] Welcome to Clowny Island!Rocket is a smaller platformer than most of those on the Nintendo 64, as evidenced by the 84 tickets to collect and the presence of only seven worlds to traverse, including the   overworld. However, most of the worlds shy away from the typical forest, lava and ice worlds typical of most platformers of the day in favor of more novel themes. These worlds also manage to keep true to the theme of the Whoopie World theme park, in that each world is actually just a smaller portion of a Disney World-like-place. Throughout the game Rocket will go behind the basic exterior of each world, showcasing the mechanical gizmos that keep everything together as an attraction. The levels include:   Whoopie World - Hub world where the rest of the levels can be accessed from, appears similar in appearance to a circus.  Clowny Island - A small island containing a few sideshow attractions and a   roller coaster. Based off the famous Coney Island amusement park.  Paint Misbehavin' - A world with Roman-themed architecture, as well a recurring theme of painting things different colors. Mine Blowing - A mine with bombable walls housing secret passageways and a minecart ride. Arabian Flights - An Arabian-themed city high above the clouds, where one uses a magic carpet vehicle to travel from place to place. Pyramid Scheme - An Aztec pyramid situated in the middle of forests and lava; Jojo has created a mirror world of lava and ash to the world's lush jungle. Food Fright - A world based completely around junk food, specifically sweets such as marshmallows, candy canes,   chocolate and   ice cream.    [CR]Awards[CR]Nintendo Power awarded Rocket: Robot on Wheels the title: "18th Greatest Nintendo 64 Game of All Time."[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Purpose codes[CR]Just pause the game and enter the codes. And as a side note, these are impossible to find.</plot>

It featured a full sit-down cabinet with a steering wheel and pedals, and multiple cabinets could be linked together for multiplayer racing.[CR]An updated release in 1997, San Francisco Rush: The Rock: Alcatraz Edition, added four new tracks and four new cars. In 1998, San Francisco Rush: The Rock: Wave Net added online multiplayer support.[CR]Nintendo 64[CR]The Nintendo 64 port, also released in 1997, included six tracks and some (but not all) cars from The Rock, plus two hidden tracks. Existing courses were also modified with new shortcuts.[CR]Playstation[CR]The 1998 Playstation release played somewhat differently, due to gravity and handling tweaks, which contributed to its poor reception compared to other versions. In addition, it featured only the three original arcade courses plus one new course, and none of the original arcade music was included. All eight original cars (but none of the cars added in The Rock) were useable.[CR]PC[CR]The Alcatraz Edition of the game also saw release on the PC. However, it was only sold in a bundle with the 3DFX Quantum Obsidian graphics card, and could not be played on any other graphics card until users later modified the game's executable.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR]The third installment in the Rush series, 2049 was released for the Nintendo 64 to mixed reviews.  The game featured the same arcade physics, spectacular crashes, and over-the-top jumps as the first two games, with a few tweaks.  The game severely curtailed the number of listed statistics for each car from the large number present in L.A. Rush.  Gone were the dubiously significant "Torque" and "Drift" bars, replaced more the more user-friendly "Top Speed", "Acceleration", "Cornering" and "Traction".  Graphically, the game took significant steps forward from L.A. especially in the vehicle models, which featured richer textures and higher polygon counts.  2049 brought back the Stunt mode introduced in L.A. Rush.  Players still spent most of their time driving toward ramps in hopes of achieving some point-worthy result, but the introduction of wings into the game gave racers the control over their landings.  Along with the goal of achieving high scores for various stunts and flips, tokens could be collected in the stunt mode which unlocked various upgrades and new vehicles.  2049 was also released as a top-down racer for the game boy color.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]To open the cheat menu, highlight options at the main menu.

		<title_clean>SD Hiryuu no Ken Densetsu</title_clean>
		<plot>Sequel to "Flying dragon"[CR][CR]An updated version of the game entitled SD Hiryu no Ken Densetsu (SD??????, "SD Legend of the Fist of the Fying Dragon"?) was released in Japan only, and added more characters (such as Jack, Ryu, and Gofire from the Super Chinese series), items and a new gameplay mode. It also removed the more realistic "Virtual mode", favoring the super deformed "Quest mode".[CR]Flying Dragon Info[CR]Flying Dragon, known in Japan as Hiryu no Ken Twin (???????, Hiryu no Ken Tsuin?, "Twin Fists of the Flying Dragon"), is a fighting game with RPG elements. Released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, it was developed and published in Japan by Culture Brain, while it was published in North America and Europe by Natsume. The game received relatively low scores on specialized reviews at the time of its release. It had a sequel a year later titled as S.D. Hiryu no Ken Densetsu.[CR]Its most notable feature was the game's SD mode that featured a character progression system, in which characters advance in levels as they become more experienced, and in which it is possible to collect credits and treasure items to equip characters with.[CR]Flying Dragon was also an NES game released by Culture Brain in 1989[1], where the player controlled a martial artist trying to recover magical scrolls stolen by the evil Tusk Soldiers. It was afforded a nominal sequel with Flying Warriors.[CR][CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game consists of two different fighting modes, though the two share many common characters.[CR]SD Version[CR]    * Ryuhi - This hot blooded fighter is the leader of the "Dragon Warriors" and an expert with Kung Fu. His home country is China and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Ryuhi is considered to being the main character of the Hiryu No Ken series, due to the fact that he appears in neary every game of the series and that the storyline of Hiryu No Ken is often focused around him.[CR]    * Hayato - This calm, gifted fighter, is familiar with all types of fighting styles. His Home country is Japan and his fighting style is Kobujutsu. Hayato is known best for being Ryuhi's friendly rival and a member of the "Dragon Warriors".[CR]    * Suzaku - This mysterious evil man, set on revenge, plans on conquering the world. His home Country is the Underworld and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Suzaku is known for being the right-hand man of Ryumaou, the series' dark antagonist.[CR]    * Yuka - A master of "Aiki-Jyujyutsu" she can throw any opponent. Her home country is Japan and her fighting style is Jyujyutsu. Yuka's pre-battle quotes to Ryuhi implies that she may in fact have a crush on him.[CR]    * Robo no Hana - The Yokozuna of Robot Sumo, who dreams of becoming the best hero in the universe. He has no home country and his fighting style is Robot Sumo. It is to be noted that Robot Sumo is held on the distant planet of Dousokui, which probably means that Robo no Hana is an alien visiting Earth. It is also to be noted that Robo no Hana had originated from the Super Chinese series, in which he appears in Super Chinese Fighter for the Super Famicom.[CR]    * Wiler - This Warrior is strong and reliable. He uses Martial Arts learned in the US Army. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mix of Martial Arts and amateur wrestling. Wiler is also known for being a member of the "Dragon Warriors"[CR]    * Powers - The top wrestler of the NCW, he plans on being the strongest in the world. His home county is the United States and his fighting style is Pro Wrestling. His physical appearance makes him resemble the former professional wrestler The Ultimate Warrior.[CR]    * Shouryu - This young ghost hunter uses ESP and he is currently training in Mexico. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mixture of martial arts and Lucha Libre wrestling. Shouryu is known for being a member of the "Dragon Warriors". It is hinted by their pre-battle quotes that Shouryu and Suzaku know each other from the past.[CR]    * Bokuchin (unlockable character) - Possibly the most mysterious character of the bunch. His physical appearance makes him look like a doll brought to life. He has no known fighting style, home country, or even his own stage. He also has the most limited moveset of all the characters. Like Robo no Hana, Bokuchin had originated from the Super Chinese series, first appearing in Super Chinese 3 for the Famicom.[CR]    * Ryumaou (unlockable character) - He is usually the main boss of both the SD and the Virtual modes. He rules the Underworld as the Devil King and is one of the fiercest and dangerous characters in the game. It is to be noted that the playable Ryumaou is a clone created by Shin Ryumaou, who is the boss for the clone.[CR][CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/576685-sd-hiryu-no-ken-densetsu[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Dragon[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Shadow Man</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadow Man is an action adventure with platforming elements based on the comic book series of the same name. It was developed and published by Acclaim, well know at the time for the Turok series, which also was a comic adaptation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the game, players take on the role of Michael LeRoi, a voodoo warrior with supernatural powers. His objective is to stop Legion, a demon from Deadside (where all dead souls go). A demon who asked a serial killer in the 1800 to design a castle in Deadside called Asylum, a place where all killers, thieves, rapists and evil souls could reside. Legion intends to use this structure to build his armies and invade Liveside, the land of the living.[CR]In order for Legion to get this serial killer to help, he had to convince him to commit suicide so he could follow him to Deadside. The game takes place in 1999. Many years after the first serial killer was recruited by Legion. By this time, 4 more serial killers have been recruited, and are know as The Five. The Five are Milton Pike, Marco Cruz, Avery Marx, John G. Pierce/Jack The Ripper (who was the architect of Asylum), and Victor Batrachian, who is acting as the leader of The five.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As Shadow Man, players can travel between Liveside and Deadside. They do so obviously by using a teddy bear as a medium that connects Michael LeRoi to his little brother's dead soul that, of course, is in Deadside. Later on in the game players can use the teddy bear to teleport to places they have already been.[CR]The game has LeRoi explore different worlds in search of 120 dark souls. These are needed by Legion to create an immortal army, thus, Shadow Man's objective becomes to get them before Legion does and to stop his plan of invading Liveside, eliminating The Five in the process. As players gain more souls, LeRoi becomes more powerful and can access new areas, meaning the game requires players to do some backtracking.[CR]Shadow Man faces different monsters throughout the game and in order defeat them, players will have to make use different weapons. Normal weapons from Liveside like shotguns and handguns, and Deadside weapons like the Shadowgun.[CR]Other than different weapons and items, LeRoi also finds reports about the serial killers and other game related events that expand the story beyond what you see in the cutscences. These can then accessed from the item menu.[CR]Shadow Man gives players the option to face The Five in any order they want and allows them to go the different worlds (if the players has enough souls) in any order without affecting the story.[CR]A Playstation 2 exclusive sequel called Shadow Man: 2econd Coming was released in 2002.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Deadsider cheat[CR]Go to Asylum:Gateway and jump down onto the square pipe and turn left. Go past the flame buckets(with Gad Toucher) and eventually after passing some pig guards you should come across a room with alot of boxes stacked on one side and a cage with a Deadsider in it. Jump up the boxes and get to the top. Then jump onto the beam supporting the arch and do so again to the next and in the middle of the last one you should unlock play as Deadsider! Then go out through the other side and some Dark Souls lie in wait for you.</plot>

		<title_clean>SimCity 2000</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SimCity 2000 is the second game in the SimCity franchise, first released in 1993 for Mac and DOS. A Windows playable version, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995. SimCity 2000 was also ported to many consoles, ranging from the SNES to the GBA, and is also available on PSN.What a city![CR]SimCity 2000 adds many features that were missing from the original. With new tools in transportation, zoning, and infrastructure, as well as a isometric view and a smoother UI, SimCity 2000 gives players more freedom than the original SimCity to create cities. With no real goal, the game instead directs players by consequence, being given a set of tools and set loose on a dynamic play area. Given enough money, the player can use the tools in any way they want, but if their cities are not generating income, the money will soon run dry. Players will find that to function, cities need utilities, civic services, transport infrastructure, and a fragile balance between homes and jobs. Playing within (and sometimes outside) the limits of the rules and seeing what works is part of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In SimCity 2000, the player starts off with a randomly generated piece of land, which could be terraformed to their liking. The player then builds a city, providing it with necessary utilities and civic structures. They also need to balance their budget, their income coming from rent and taxes, and their expenditure from building and maintaining the city. If they run below a certain budget deficit, they will be kicked out of the mayor's office, losing the game.Undeveloped Zones[CR]There are 3 main types of buildings in SimCity 2000: Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI). They are not built by the player directly. Instead, the player "zones" certain plots of land for specific development. Zones are the main type development in any city in the SimCity franchise, and what grows in those zones are determined by the amounts of utilities and services that plot can receive, and the land value of the area. Players can also zone landfills, air and seaports, and military bases. These zones are not as affected by land value as RCI zones but they will drastically affect their surrounding areas negatively.[CR]Land value is an important factor in SimCity 2000, and can be raised or lowered by the presence or absence of water features, trees, and pollution. It can also be affected presence or absence of civic structures, power and water supply, and good transport infrastructure. Rewards, special buildings given to the player for reaching certain population milestones, also help to boost land value of the area.Arcologies[CR]Arcologies are special futuristic buildings, rewarded to players once they reach a city population of 120,000 and they are after the year that they are invented. There are 4 arcologies in SimCity 2000: Plymouth Arco, Forest Arco, Darco, and the Launch Arco. Arcologies provide the city with a huge boost in population, the smallest one (Forest Arco) providing 30,000 residents, and the mighty Launch Arco giving a massive 60,000 residents.[CR]Launch Arcos also have a special effect. After building 300 Launch Arcos, a special message "The exodus has begun." will appear, and the they will "launch" (in reality, just explode). The player will then be compensated for the construction costs after all the Launch Arcos have been launched. This only occurs in the PC and Mac versions of the game.Disasters[CR]Disasters will hamper a player's construction of their cities (unless they turned it off). These disasters are random, and range from mundane (a fire), to the extreme (monster invasions). Players can also activate these disasters purposely to destroy their cities for fun. There are 8 disasters in the game:Fire: An inferno blazes through the city. Fire stations help put it out.Flood: Waters flood into the city. Dispatch emergency services to limit floods.Air Crash: A plane crashes into the city and starts fires.Tornado: A rampaging tornado rips up trees and buildings.Earthquake: An earthquake destroys both buildings and underground infrastructure.Monster: A giant sphere with an huge eye descends on the city, and sets things on fire with its laser beams.Hurricane: A hurricane destroys buildings and cause flooding.Rioters: Unhappy Sims protest on the streets and start fires. Police presence helps to limit rioting.Scenarios[CR]SimCity 2000 comes with 6 scenarios, where the player can take over an existing city (either fictional or based on a real city) and try to solve its problems. They are: Charleston, Dullsville, Flint, Hollywood, Oakland Hills, and Davenport. An additional scenario pack was also released for the game, Scenarios Vol 1: Great Disasters. As the name suggests, players have to battle disasters in 12 new cities: Atlanta, Barcelona, Chicago, Davenport, Homestead, Malibu, Manhattan, Oakland, Portland, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Washington D.C.[CR]SimCity Urban Renewal Kit[CR]The SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK) is a toolset that players can use to create and modify buildings for SimCity 2000. It first shipped with the Scenarios Vol 1: Great Disasters expansion but then made its way to the SimCity 2000 Special Edition released in 1995. SCURK is divided into 3 parts: "Paint the Town", a bitmap editor to create and edit buildings, "Pick and Copy", a tileset creator, and "Place and Print", basically a sandbox version of the original game. SCURK created a vibrant mod community with SimCity 2000, and some fan designs made it to SimCity 3000.[CR]System Requirements[CR]PC System Requirements (GOG Version)OS: Windows XP/Windows VistaProcessor: 1.8 GHz Processor or equivalentMemory: 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)Video: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)HDD: 2GB of free hard drive space[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus Map[CR]At the title screen, press:</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Though it never enjoyed the mass market success of kart racing franchises like Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing, Snowboard Kids polished game mechanics and stylish presentation ensured the game's status as a surprising cult hit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Nancy racing against three other racers on Big Snowman.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of four snowboarders racing down a mountain course. Racers can perform tricks and acquire power-ups through item/shot boxes to gain the upper hand. A lap is completed when a racer reaches the bottom of the course and goes through the lift gate. The racer is lifted back up to the start of the course to begin the next lap. The first racer who reaches the bottom of the course on the final lap wins the race.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Battle Race[CR]The main game mode of Snowboard Kids where four snowboarders race each other down the course performing tricks and utilizing items and weapons. The first racer who reaches the bottom of the course on the final lap wins the race.Skill Games[CR]There are three skill games available to play in Snowboard Kids: speed, shot, and trick.[CR]Speed: The speed skill game challenges the player to post the fastest time on the course. Fans are scattered throughout the race course for the players to acquire a temporary speed boost. This mode can only be played on Rookie Mountain, Big Snowman, and Sunset Rock.[CR]Shot: The shot skill game challenges the player to shoot and destroy as many snowmen scattered on the course. The player has unlimited ammo to use, but shooting too many shots in a quick matter results in overheating and unable to shoot for a few seconds before they are able to shoot again. Only Rookie Mountain, Big Snowman, and Sunset Rock are the available courses to play this mode.[CR]Trick: The trick mode challenges the player to accumulate as many trick points on the course for three minutes. A special course (Animal Land) is designated for this course that has particular features for players to performs numerous tricks on.Time Attack[CR]The time attack challenges players to post the fastest time on a course. Unlike the speed skill game mode, time attack mode can be played on all courses. Also, the player is limited to one fan which they can use at their discretion.Local Battle Race Multiplayer (2 to 4 Players)[CR]Local multiplayer in Snowboard Kids is limited to a battle race. All race courses, characters and boards unlocked from the single player modes can be used here.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Snowboard Kids has six total playable characters. Each character is rated out of three stars in three attributes: speed, turn, and trick.SlashSlash[CR]An all-around character, Slash is a good choice for beginning players. He doesn't have any particular weaknesses, but nor does he have any specific strengths.Speed: 2Turn: 2Trick: 2NancyNancy[CR]Though she is the slowest character in the game, Nancy is superb both at tricks and at turning.Speed: 1Turn: 3Trick: 3JamJam[CR]Jam is the character most similar to Nancy. He is slightly faster than her, though this comes at the cost of him being slightly worse at both tricks and turning.Speed: 1.5Turn: 2.5Trick: 2.5TommyTommy[CR]The fastest character in the game, the portly Tommy can easily achieve breakneck speeds, though this comes at the cost of extraordinarily poor tricks and turning ability.Speed: 3Turn: 1Trick: 1LindaLinda[CR]Very similar to Tommy, Linda is a slightly slower version of him with minute improvements in her handling and tricks.Speed: 2.5Turn: 1.5Trick: 1.5Shinobin[CR]Shinobin is a ninja snowboarder that can be unlocked as a playable character once the player finishes first on the Ninja Land course. His turning and tricks are at Jam's level, while his speed is at Linda's. This effectively makes him an all-around balanced character like Slash, albeit better in every regard.Speed: 2.5Turn: 2.5Trick: 2.5[CR]Tracks[CR]Rookie Mountain[CR]One of the shortest and easiest tracks in the game. A good beginner's course. Default 5 laps.Big SnowmanLinda on Rookie Mountain[CR]The longest course in the game which features multiple high ramps where more difficult special tricks can be performed. Default 2 laps.Sunset Rock[CR]A course run the sunset which include penguins on course, a railing to grind on, and a big snowman in the middle of the course that shoots snowmen toward the racers. Default 3 laps.Night Highway[CR]A course run on an abandoned highway which features narrow sections, tricky jump gaps, and multiple shortcuts. Default 3 laps.Grass ValleyJam on Night Highway[CR]This course goes through a mine shaft, farmland, and a small village. The first course without any snow. Default 3 laps.Dizzy Land[CR]Who doesn't want to snowboard through an amusement park? Not to be confused with Disneyland, this theme park features spinning tea cups that launch you backwards much like a pinball bumper. Default 3 laps.Quicksand Valley[CR]The first unlockable course and graded as the hardest course in the game. It is run through a hot desert and features quick sand, branching paths, and tricky/deceptive jump ramps. Default 3 laps.Silver Mountain[CR]The second unlockable course, this course's intense fog diminishes the racer's visibility to see the course's jumps and turns ahead. Default 3 laps.Ninja Land[CR]The last course to unlock. One of the shortest courses in the game, it is run through a feudal Japanese setting. Shinobin appears as a competing racer in this course. Default 9 laps.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Power-ups are divided up into two types: "Shots" and "Items". Racers acquired either power-up type by running through a box on course at the cost of 100 coins. The racer will be knocked down if they attempt to acquire a power-up if they do not have 100 coins on hand.ShotsJam holding the Slapstick item in his shot inventory.[CR]Shots provide the racer an offensive weapon to use against other racers. They are indicated in red boxes on the race course and are acquired in a set-of-three.[CR]Bombs: Bombs expel a large blast radius upon impact against a wall or hit racer. Other racers in the vicinity of the blast radius will be knocked down as well.[CR]Slapstick: Slapsticks are giant hands hurled toward other racers where they knock down a racer if they are hit by it. They come out fast and tracks a racer like a homing missile.[CR]Parachutes: Parachutes are chutes when a racer is hit, they are thrown up in the air then slowly fall back to the ground. This item is effective to use against others by jump ramps, as they'll lose valuable time and race position by waiting many seconds to fall back down to the ground.[CR]Snowman: Snowman transforms a racer hit by this item into a snowman. While a snowman, you cannot turn and will keep going until a few seconds are up when you are free to move again, or you hit a wall and knocked down. Snowman are able to bounce off walls.[CR]Freeze Shot: Freeze shots will freeze the racer hit by it. Other racers who run into the frozen racer will hit the character like they've hit a wall.ItemsSlash holding the Rat item in his item inventory.[CR]Items provide defensive or trump-card like items to use against other racers. They are indicated in blue boxes on the race course.[CR]Pans: Probably the most comical item in this game, and usually given to the racer in last place. Pans target all other racers and squashes them with a pan overhead and are unavoidable to dodge. Only the invincibility item can prevent a targeted racer from being squashed.[CR]Invisible: Invincibility provides a racer temporary protection from most items. Racers can lose invincibility early if they trip over a rock or they hit a wall. Invisible racers can be affected by ghosts and rats.[CR]Speed Fan: The speed fan provides a racer a speed boost for a short length of time.[CR]Rat: The rat steals ALL the money that the leading player has. If the leading player acquires and uses this item, it'll steal all the money of whomever is in second place.[CR]Rock: The rock trips any character who comes in contact with it. It is fairly small so it is difficult to see on the race course.[CR]Ghost: The ghost slows down the leading player. The leading player can be affected with multiple ghosts from trailing racers. If the leading racer uses ghost, the racer in second place gets affected.[CR]Boards[CR]Main Boards[CR]There are three main types of snowboards racers can select. These boards can be upgraded to three levels, each one slightly better than the last.[CR]All-Around: All-around boards have equal speed, turning and trick stats.[CR]Alpine: Alpine boards have the highest speed, but lowest turning and trick ability.[CR]Freestyle: Freestyle boards have the lowest speed, but highest turn and trick abilities.Special Boards[CR]Once the game has been completed, players may earn new "Special Boards". The three special boards include the Star Board, the Feather Board, and the Ice Board. Shinobin is the only character that cannot equip these boards.[CR]The Star Board has the speed of an Alpine board, but has the turning of a freestyle board.[CR]The Feather Board has the best trick ability in the game as it is able to stay in the air much longer than other boards.[CR]The Ice Board is a "joke board" where its turning abilities are negligent, despite its decent speed and trick abilities.Shinobin[CR]Shinobin is an exception with this own "Shinobin" brand boards. For example, his Alpine board is shaped like a Kunai and is essentially called Shinobin Board 3.[CR]Tricks[CR]All racers can perform a number of tricks to earn currency in turn to purchase power-up items on the course and purchase new boards at the board shop.[CR]Grabs: Racers can perform a grab by grabbing a hand to a particular side of their board in the air. Only one grab can be performed, but the grab can be held as long as the racer is airborne.[CR]Spins: Racers can perform spins or flips off jump ramps. Only one spin/flip move is permitted for a racer in the air.[CR]Signature Tricks: Each character has a number of special tricks that nets large amounts of money if done successfully. The player can perform a racer's special trick by inputting a sequence of directional inputs as the racer is in its crouching state. The racer will emit blue sparkles to indicate a special trick was performed.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Course Code[CR]At the main menu the one that says Start Lession/Option, carefully enter the following:[CR]Press Down, Up on the analog, Down Up on the D-Pad, then Down C, Up C, L Button, R Button, Z Button, then Left on the D-Pad, Right C, Up on the analog joystick, B, Right on the D-Pad, Left C and then press Start.[CR]A confirmation sound will sound when entered correctly.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Ninja Land[CR]First earn gold cups on courses 1 to 8.

		<title_clean>Snowboard Kids 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The true sequel to Snowboard Kids (Snowboard Kids Plus for the Playstation is an expansion to Snowboard Kids), Snowboard Kids 2 updates the first game with new characters, tracks, items, and revamped single player. The revamped single player involves a story between Damien, a rather silly demon, and the Snowboard Kids. The story is told through a number of in game cut scenes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay of Snowboard Kids 2 remains the same from the original. Four racers race from the top of the course to the bottom. During the race, the racers can perform tricks and collect coins on course to acquire power-ups to use against their opponents. A lap is completed when the racer reaches the bottom of the course and goes through the gate to the lift. The racer is then lifted back at the top of the course to begin the next lap. The first race who reaches the bottom of the course on the final lap wins the race.Boss Battles[CR]New to Snowboard Kids 2 and tied in with the game's story, boss battles pit one racer against the boss racer down the course. The goal in boss battles is to deplete the boss's health before the boss reaches the bottom of the course. Power-ups are scattered throughout the race course to assist the player battle and defeat the boss.Gameplay Changes[CR]There are some significant gameplay changes made in Snowboard Kids 2 from the first game.Racers recover much faster when hit by items.Circuits are shorter in length.If the player does not have enough money to acquire an item from the item box on the course, their character will run through the item box instead of being knocked down from the first game.The special trick system is replaced by a more generic system in which the player determines how many tricks they are able to do in the air. There are no longer are special inputs needed to execute multiple spins.Board reverse from the first game, where the racer is heading down the course with the wrong front end of the board, has been eliminated.Characters have more than one outfit, and are themed as Winter, Summer, Halloween, and Space.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Slash KameiThe character select screen including the unlockable characters[CR]The all around snowboarder Slash is back. He has no real strengths or weaknesses.Jam Kuehnemund[CR]Jam went from the trickster type to an all around type this time around. Like Slash, he has no real strengths or weaknesses.Tommy Parsy[CR]Tommy is surprisingly not the fastest character this time around, but he is the fastest out of all the default characters. Compared to the last Snowboard Kids game, he actually can turn a little better this time, though not by much. He has poor trick and turning abilities.Nancy Neil[CR]Nancy now has the stats that Jam had the last game. Her trick ability is not quite as good as Wendy's.Linda Maltinie[CR]Linda is basically the same has the previous game. She has the second fastest speed out of the default characters and the second worst turning ability.Wendy Rain[CR]The new character out of all the default characters, she has the slowest speed out of all the default characters, but the best trick ability.Unlockable Characters[CR]These characters cannot be played in story mode.Mr. Dog[CR]The friendly board shop owner is now a playable character. He's even faster than Tommy, but his turning ability is next to none.Coach[CR]A blue penguin that is seen periodically in this game has the best tricking ability as well as turning ability in the game. He literally floats in the air while he jumps, but he also is the slowest character.Damien[CR]A demon that attempts to cause trouble is the last of the unlockable characters. He's an all around character with slightly better stats than Slash and Jam.[CR]Tracks[CR]Unlike its predecessor, Snowboard Kids 2's locks all races at three laps.Sunny Mountain[CR]This is a straight forward beginner's course.Turtle Island[CR]The first in the list of unrealistic surfaces to snowboard on, snowboard through a tropical island...and underwater. Watch for a shortcut inside the pirate ship under the sea.Jingle Town[CR]Snowboard through a small Christmas themed village. Major landmarks involve a giant snowman, the village itself, and an onslaught of bunny rabbits that seem oblivious to the snowboarders. Avoid them with caution.Jingle Town (Night)[CR]The first boss fight course, it's basically the same as Jingle Town except it's at night and without the annoying bunnies and other hazardous obstacles.Wendy's House[CR]Honey I Shrunk the Snowboarders. Somehow, Wendy takes her snowboarding to the next level by making her own course in her own living room. Watch out for the giant pendulum on the grandfather clock in the center of the map, it's painful to run into.Linda's Castle[CR]Other than Wendy, rich kid Linda also has the funds to create her own course...through her entire house...er castle. Lots of tight corners, and a giant statue of Linda in the center of the the track.Crazy Jungle[CR]Snowboard through a tropical jungle this time. Best part of this map involves the giant waterfall to trick off of to your heart's content. Otherwise, there's a shortcut that involves the use of your board sliding skills, as well as a ruins where an angry idol wants to bomb you.Crazy Jungle (Night)[CR]The second boss battle of this game, it's basically the same as the original, but without the obstacles as well.Starlight Highway[CR]The first of the unlockable tracks, this brings the snowboard kids to space. Apparently, the gravity in space is the same as on Earth considering the jump height of the characters remain the same on this map. Watch out for the bumpers near the end of the track.Haunted House[CR]A track through a haunted house. The racers can be affected by ghosts who are found wandering on the course. Floating furniture also can get in the way as well.Ice Land[CR]No, this is not that European country, it's a track in the arctic. Some tight corners, and some places to push fellow boarders to their doom.Ice Land (Night)[CR]The final boss battle occurs here. The intense fog limits the players ability to see anything on the course by a certain distance, adding an additional challenge to the player to navigate and battle the boss on the course.Battle Mode Only Tracks[CR]These tracks can only be selected under battle mode.Snowboard Street[CR]Race through Snow Town, the Snowboard Kid's hometown. Not really a difficult course, but there are some 90 degree corners near the end.Snowboard Street II[CR]While not officially called Snowboard Street "II", there is no real difference from it's original counterpart other than the placement of the item boxes and the music.X-Course[CR]The game's training course. It's shortest track in the game and houses the biggest ramps.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Power-ups are divided up into two types: "Shots" and "Items". Shots are found in red boxes strewn around the course. They provide offensive power ups for the player and are always acquired in sets of three. Items are found in blue boxes strewn around the course. They provide defensive, or the "trump card" like items.Shots[CR]Bombs: Bombs are shots that explode upon impact on a racer, or by a wall or obstacle on course. Upon impact, the bomb explodes with a blast radius which knocks down all racers in its radius. Bombs are the only shot item that can be shot backwards to trailing racers.[CR]Slapstick: Slapsticks are giant hands that come out fast and homes in on the nearest racer. The racer hit with the slapstick gets knocked down and loses a bit of their money onto the course.[CR]Parachutes: When a racer is hit by a parachute, the racer is shot upward in the air then the chute deploys, causing the racer to lose valuable distance against the other racers as they await to land on the course. Parachutes are very effective against the opposition when used before a huge ramp.[CR]Snowman: The snowman item causes the racer hit by it to turn into a snowman, where they lose the ability to turn on course. The snowman item can also bounce off the course's walls when shot by a racer.[CR]Icicle: Icicles will freeze the racer hit by it. The racer is frozen in ice for a few seconds on the course, making it an obstacle on course that knocks down racers who hit the frozen racer.[CR]Tornado: A new shot item introduced in Snowboard Kids 2. A tornado hurls the racer on impact up in the air and lands the racer in a knocked down state on course upon landing. The hit racer also loses their shot/item they have carried onto the course, where another racer can acquire.Items[CR]Pans: The pan automatically targets and squashes the opposing racers. This item is typically awarded to the racer in last place for that racer to catch up to their fellow racers ahead. Only the invincibility item can prevent the targeted racer from being squashed.[CR]Feather: The feather allows the racer to attain more air, allowing them to perform more tricks and earn more money. This is one of the new items introduced in Snowboard Kids 2.[CR]Invisible: The invincibility item prevents the invisible racer from being hit from shots and items targeted against them. However, the invisible racer is not immune to ghosts and will lose their invincibility if they trip over a rock.[CR]Rocket: Another new item in the game, the rocket provides a short but powerful burst of speed.[CR]Speed Fan: The speed fan gives the racer a moderate boost in speed for a couple of seconds.[CR]Rat: The rat steals ALL the money from the leading racer. If the leading racer uses the rat item, the rat will steal all the money from the second place racer.[CR]Super Rat: The super rat steals ALL money from the opposing racers.[CR]Rock: The rock is a small item that a racer can place on a course which trips over another racer who hits the item. Due to it's small size, it may be hard to detect to see on course and can be used strategically on specific areas of the course.[CR]Ghost: The ghost slows down the leading racer. If the leading racer uses the item, the racer in second gets affected.[CR]Super Ghost: The super ghost slows down all opposing racers.[CR]Boards[CR]Snowboard Kids 2 offers more boards for the player to use. Along with the regular three boards, there are numerous special boards with their unique statistics for the player to choose to fit their play style.Regular Boards[CR]Snowboard Kids 2 has three regular type boards: trick, balance, and speed boards. Trick boards have higher stats in turning and jumping, the speed board has higher speed stats in lieu of lower turning and trick ability, and the balance board has equal amount of turning and jumping ability. Higher level boards increase the speed in all regular board. The trick board also gains increased turning stats in higher levels.[CR]TrickLevel 1 - Speed: 2, Turn: 2, Jump: 5Level 2 - Speed: 4, Turn: 4, Jump: 5Level 3 - Speed: 6, Turn: 5, Jump: 5[CR]BalanceLevel 1 - Speed: 3, Turn: 4, Jump: 4Level 2 - Speed: 5, Turn: 4, Jump: 4Level 3 - Speed: 7, Turn: 4, Jump: 4[CR]SpeedLevel 1 - Speed: 4, Turn: 3, Jump: 3Level 2 - Speed: 6, Turn: 3, Jump: 3Level 3 - Speed: 8, Turn: 3, Jump: 3Special Boards[CR]Special boards are boards that have unique attributes.[CR]Poverty: The racer continually loses money as they race the course with this board equipped.Speed: 3, Turn: 4, Jump: 4[CR]Feather: The feather board allows the racer to float in the air longer as they jump, hence the highest jump rating. The higher air time allows the racer to perform more tricks during their time airborne as well as avoid multiple shots and items shot at them.Speed: 6, Turn: 5, Jump: 10[CR]Ice: The ice board has the racer on a board made entirely out of ice. It has a high speed stat, but a very low turning stat. Racers using the ice board will go pretty fast, but will have a hard time turning corners on the course.Speed: 7, Turn: 1, Jump: 4[CR]Star: The best all around board in the game, this board has the turning and jump abilities of a trick board with the speed abilities of a speed board.Speed: 8, Turn: 5, Jump: 5[CR]Rich: The racer will continually accumulate gold as they race on the course with the rich board equipped.Speed: 7, Turn: 4, Jump: 4[CR]Dragon: The dragon board has a rocket item equipped on the board as long as the racer is upright along with longer airborne time with its high speed and jump stats. However, with the rocket on the board at all times, racers will have a hard time maneuvering turns on the course.Speed: 10, Turn: 1, Jump: 10[CR]Ninja: The ninja board has the racer invisible for the entire race. At the cost for being invisible, the ninja board has the lowest speed stat of all boards in the game.Speed: 1, Turn: 5, Jump: 5[CR]Charm: The charm board prevents the racer from being affect by ghosts.Speed: 7, Turn: 4, Jump: 4[CR]High Tech: The high tech board equips the fan item on the board as long as the racer stays upright on the race course. Speed: 9, Turn: 4, Jump: 4[CR]Trick System[CR]The basic spins and grabs from the first Snowboard Kids game carry over here in Snowboard Kids 2, where the player can input a directional to determine the direction of the spin as they prepare ahead of the ramp, along with the board grab as they spin.[CR]The special tricks from Snowboard Kids, where a special set of directional inputs must be performed during the racer's windup before the ramp, has been completely removed. In its place, the player can perform multiple spins and grabs in the air to accumulate huge sums of money, which is performed by setting the directional to the desired position and pressing the jump button continually.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Have all characters, boards, and levels[CR]On the title screen press the following: Z, B, Top C, Down on the control pad, Left on the control stick, Right on the control stick, Up on the control pad, R, Z, and A. If you entered it correctly, Damien will cackel and twirl off the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]Successfully complete story mode to get this very skilled character.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]South Park is a first person shooter from Acclaim designed by Turok developer Iguana Entertainment originally released for the Nintendo 64, then later ported to PC and PlayStation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players choose the role of either Stan, Kyle, Kenny or Cartman to fight their way through each level using ludicrous weapons such as yellow snowballs, cow launchers or even a gun that makes your enemies dance. The game was built on the engine used for Turok 2 and, in spite of its simplistic art style, featured Expansion Pak support for the Nintendo 64 version, giving players higher resolution textures and a greater draw distance like the later PC port. Single player consists of playing through each level called an "Episode" with three chapters. Each episode ends in a boss fight. The multiplayer mode is deathmatch style and allows up to four player split screen on the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation 1. The PC version had online play available. The multiplayer mode allows players to pick from a vast array of characters from the South Park universe, with additional characters being unlocked by completing different levels of the single player mode.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Multiplayer consists of three different modes: Time Limited, Damage Limited, or Unending. It is only possible to play multiplayer online through GameSpy's network on the PC edition of the game.List of multiplayer charactersMr. MackeyChefWendyTerrancePhillipMr. GarrisonPipVisitorOfficer BarbradyLiane CartmanStarvin' MarvinDr. MephistoIkeBig Gay AlNedJimboStanKyleCartmanKenny[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Most weapons have secondary fire.Snowballs, The default weapon.

Secondary fire: The zoom functionCow launcher, Fires a cow that lands on the enemy getting their head stuck up the cows butt.

However apart from this small nugget of information the game was never released and no further details were ever known.There was Game Boy Color version of the game being developed, apparently it was cancelled because the show's creators did not believe the platform was the right demographic. Only one screenshot has been released to the public.[CR]</plot>

It is trivia about topics that relate to South Park, such as the band The Cure.

		<title_clean>Space Invaders</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game&#8217;s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).[CR]Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player&#8217;s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their &#8220;invasion.&#8221; As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).[CR]The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or &#8220;bunkers&#8221; near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a &#8220;mystery ship&#8221; will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.[CR]Development[CR]While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinet[CR]Due to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.[CR]In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[CR]It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game&#8217;s original title, Space Monsters.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins&#8212;and subsequent production increase&#8212;in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 version[CR]The 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first "killer app" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).[CR]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as "the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time." Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Games" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of "The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time," stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which "were attempts to simulate already-existing things," Space Invaders was "the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else." In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.[CR]As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.[CR]It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.[CR]Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a &#8220;high score,&#8221; and was the first to save the player&#8217;s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari&#8217;s Asteroids, Williams&#8217; Defender, and Namco&#8217;s Galaxian series.[CR]It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a "seminal arcade classic", IGN listed it as the number eight "classic shoot 'em up". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry.Remakes and sequelsSpace Invaders '95, one of many sequels[CR]Recent ports and remakes include Space Invaders Anniversary, released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and including nine variants of the core game. Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders were featured in the arcade compilation Taito Legends (released in 2005), and Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders DX were featured in Taito Legends 2 (released in 2006). A remake of the game called Space Invaders Extreme was released for the PSP and Nintendo DS in 2008 and on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009. A second remake, Space Invaders Infinity Gene, was released in 2009 on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS devices.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play in Alien Homeworld[CR]Play a game on the expert setting and beat Earth.

		<plot>Description[CR]Silicon Valley was intended to be the most technologically advanced amusement park civilization has ever known. Shortly after take-off, it disappeared. Now, in the year 3000, it's back and on a collision course with Earth! It's up to you to conquer the 30 levels in four incredibly lavish environments, take control of the totally original, wacky and - at times - life threatening characters and unlock the mysteries of the Valley. It's all great fun but remember, the fate of the world is in your hands![CR][CR][B]Storyline:[/B][CR]The game's storyline revolves around a space station, home to numerous animals (the station was intended by the designer to be a "technologically advanced amusement park"), which was launched and, seven minutes into the launch, subsequently lost in the year 2001. Thought to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and its designer, Professor Cheese, mysteriously vanishes upon an excursion to the station. Following this, a duo of "Heroes for Hire", namely Danger Dan and his robotic partner, Evo, a perfect, "super-intelligent, self-evolving robot", and the end result of the Silicon Valley experiment. Danger Dan and Evo are dispatched to the station in order to investigate this disappearance. They arrive to find that over 1000 years, the animal cargo had evolved and merged with technology; examples including an electronically-powered fox with motorized wheels and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Throughout the course of the game, the space station is on a collision course with Earth, and it is the player's mission to save all of humanity. At the end of the game, Evo arrives at the control room in the center of the station. He confronts the Evil Brain, who, after watching Evo on his adventure through the station, is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep Evo to complete his collection of robotic animals. The Brain is interested in Evo because he believes that Evo's powers can lead him to domination of the galaxy. He claims that "with your body and my mind, we can rule the stars" The Brain is also threatening to fire his "Doomsday-o-Matic shrinkray" at the earth. Evo easily defeats the Brain with his laser-vision, but is unable to stop the Space Station from spinning out of control. The station finally collides with earth, landing in New York Harbor. In the process, all of the robotic animals escape from the station. Evo (now fully constructed) must run around New York City, searching out and terminating all of the animals before they terrorize or take over the planet.[CR][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Within the game, the player controls Evo, a robot who is reduced to no more than a crawling microchip during the crash into the station caused by a fight the heroes were having over which radio station to listen to. Without protection, Evo will lose energy at a steady rate. To survive, Evo must enter the bodies of the animals therein (who each possess their own abilities), in order to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level, collecting Evo's "purple power cells" along the way. As this progresses, Dan is trapped in the team's destroyed spaceship and does nothing but assign Evo his missions and watch the player's actions, occasionally commenting.[CR]As the player progresses through the 4 distinct sections of the space station,(Euro-Eden, Arctic Kingdom, Jungle Safari, and Desert Adventure) he/she collects the scattered remains of Evo's protective shell suit, eventually re-assembling him for the final level.[CR][CR]Bugs and glitches[CR]The game has been known to freeze up, but it is a rare occurrence. Freezes are more common when using the Expansion Pak. In some cases it is impossible to get past the first few start up screens if the Expansion Pak is present.[CR]In some levels, the player may be able to pass through walls if hit at the right angle. This is more common in "Stinky Sewers", where the walls can be unstable. In places, the player may even pass through walls to the outside of the level which can result in the player dying instantly.[CR]A further bug prevents the player from collecting all of the souvenirs in the game. Since this bug occurs, it is impossible for the player to complete the game and witness its proper ending. Collecting all of the souvenirs also unlocks a secret bonus level. This cannot be accessed normally because of the bug. However, it can be reached by entering a code at the level selection screen.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]# Scenes from this game are featured in the music video for Mouse On Mars' song "Twift Shoeblade". [[CR]# The 'victory theme' heard after completing a level can be heard occasionally on one of the radio stations in DMA's 1999 game, Grand Theft Auto 2.[CR]# In a recent interview[when?], drummer Jimmy Chamberlin stated that this was one of his favorite games he had ever played.[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/198727-space-station-silicon-valley[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Station_Silicon_Valley[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus Energy[CR]At the Saved Game screen, enter the following:[CR]Left-C, L, Z, Down, L, Z, Left-C, Right-C[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Opening[CR]Turn on the system, hold A or B.

		<title_clean>Spider-Man</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spider-Man is an action-adventure starring Spider-Man, first released in August 2000. The game was originally developed by Neversoft for the Playstation using the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater engine, and was eventually ported to Nintendo 64, PC and Dreamcast by various other studios. A side-scroller, entirely different from the other versions except for its story, was made for the Game Boy Color by Vicarious Visions.[CR]The game features an original storyline based on the comic book franchise, and has no connection to the 2002 movie Spider-Man, which would receive its own game adaptation.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]When Doctor Octopus finds himself reformed from his past criminal ways, he also finds the public happy to respect him as a scientist again. Presenting a scientific demonstration, someone impersonating Spider-Man appears. The real Spider-Man, out of costume as Peter Parker witnesses this, as he is attending the presentation. The fake Spider-Man steals the experiment and leaves but not before he shatters the camera belonging to Eddie Brock who believed it to be the real Spider-Man and was taking pictures. As Brock becomes angry, the Venom symbiote attaches itself to him. The entire party of people at the presentation believe that Spider-Man was responsible for the theft and the police immediately start a manhunt for him.[CR]As Peter leaves, he foils a bank robbery as Spider-Man and then saves J. Jonah Jameson from the Scorpion who blames Jameson for his transformation. As Spidey defeats the Scorpion, the police arrive, and Spidey escapes, with Jameson crying out that he still doesn't like Spider-Man. After being chased throughout the city, The Black Cat approaches Spider-Man warning him of two problems: The Rhino is attacking a power plant, and Venom has kidnapped Peter's wife, Mary-Jane. Spider-Man deals with the Rhino, but suddenly The Black Cat is kidnapped by an unknown party. Spider-Man searches for but cannot locate him until the psychotic villain makes his presence known. Obsessed with Spider-Man since the presentation Venom leads Spider-Man on an absurd chase through the sewers.[CR]Finally catching Venom, Spider-Man first rescues Mary-Jane, and then convinces Eddie Brock that he has been framed. Venom and Spider-Man team up, looking to find whoever is responsible and start their search in the Daily Bugle offices.[CR]Whilst at the office, Venom senses Carnage, his symbiotic offspring, and immediately abandons Spider-Man. Throughout the building, Spidey finds symbiotes infesting the building, and learns who the imposter is: Special Effects guru, Mysterio. Spider-Man engages in an intense battle with Mysterio who reveals that his boss plans to conquer the city with his army of symbiotes.[CR]When Spidey follows Mysterio's directions to a warehouse, he discovers a secret underground base where symbiotes are being manufactured. Spider-Man discovers and frees Black Cat and progresses further into the base where he finds Carnage and Doc Ock, who only pretended to be reformed. With Venom's help (who has suddenly reappeared), Spider-Man defeats both Carnage and Doc Ock. But suddenly the Carnage symbiote fuses with Doc Ock's arms which proceeds to create a giant 'CarnOck' which destroys the base. Venom and Spidey make it out of the base, just in time. All the villains are left in the hands of the police, in prison and Spider-Man's name is restored.[CR]Development and Gameplay[CR]For story sequences, the Nintendo 64 version uses captioned freeze-frames in a comic book style, whereas the PlayStation, Windows, Dreamcast, and PC versions have FMV cutscenes. This is mainly due to hardware limitations.[CR]If the player enters the code 'GBHSRSPM' within the game, they can activate a separate mode called What If? mode. Based on the What If? series of comics that acted as a proposed alternative events throughout Marvel Comic's history, the What If? mode acted much the same way, becoming an alternate version of the standard game. The game itself remains the same, although there are minor changes in scenery and audio tracks. Also, similar to the comic books, when players begin a new game, the character of The Watcher appears and explains that things are not as they seem and are different to how they once were.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The actors Rino Romano, Jennifer Hale and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. reprised their roles from the animated series'.On the rooftops there is an advertisement for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. When Spider-Man sees this, he makes a reference to skating with Tony Hawk, a reference to Spider-Man being a playable character in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.In one level, when chased by Police, Spider-Man can check inside a crane to find The Green Goblin's hidden base.Storyboards indicate that The Lizard was going to be involved in the game, via a scene with him in jail at the end of the game but in the end he was replaced by a Jade Syndicate Robber.During the Race to the Bugle level, there's a billboard for Stark Solutions, a reference to Iron Man protagonist Tony Stark.On the Bank Robbery level, players are able to locate the Fantastic Four base and climb onto it.The PlayStation version for the game (and all subsequent ports) have cutscenes but the N64 copy doesn't.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Enter these codes in the Cheat menu:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited Fire Webbing[CR]On any stage where you can pick up the magnesium to make the fire webbing, if you use one of the unlimited webbing costumes, you will get an unending fire web-cartridge until either the end of the level or death.</plot>

		<title_clean>Star Fox 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Fox 64 (known in Europe as Lylat Wars) is a 3D sci-fi shooter developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 on July 1, 1997.The sequel to Star Fox, Star Fox 64 re-tells the story of Fox McCloud (the leader of the elite Star Fox team of Arwing pilots) as he ventures through the Lylat star system with his wingmen (cocky Falco Lombardi, mentor Peppy Hare, and inexperienced Slippy Toad) and mothership (the Great Fox, piloted by robot R.O.B. 64) to counter-attack the forces of mad scientist Andross (including the Star Wolf, a rival team of mercenaries led by Wolf O'Donnell).Sporting a brand new engine, Star Fox 64 includes a variety of new gameplay mechanics from its predecessor, including special "All-Range Mode" stages (where players can move freely around a designated battlefield), stages with unique new vehicles (including the Landmaster tank and Blue Marine submarine), new maneuvers (a Somersault in normal mode and a U-Turn in All-Range mode), a campaign with branching paths (which get easier or harder depending on how well the player completes objectives), and competitive split-screen multiplayer (for up to four simultaneous players).Star Fox 64 is the first console game in history to support force feedback, due to being the first game to use the Nintendo 64's Rumble Pak accessory (which was bundled in all copies of the game).The game was later released for the Wii (via the Virtual Console) on April 2, 2007 and was later remade for the Nintendo 3DS (as Star Fox 64 3D) on September 9, 2011. Along with updated graphics, sounds, and control schemes, the remake also includes a "Gyro Controls" mode (allowing the player to use the 3DS's gyroscope for motion control) and LAN multiplayer.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Years before, strange activity is spotted on the planet Venom, where the mad scientist Andross had been exiled. The original Star Fox, made up of James McCloud, Peppy Hare, and Pigma Dengar, is sent to investigate. However, once they arrived, Pigma betrays the team and allows James and Peppy to be captured by Andross. Peppy manages to barely escape by himself and returns to Corneria, the governing planet of the Lylat system, to tell James's son Fox his father's fate. Years later, Andross unleashes an attack across the Lylat system prompting Corneria to send the new Star Fox team, made up of Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi, original member Peppy Hare, and Slippy Toad, to repel and investigate the attacks.Along the way to Venom, the team will face their rivals, Star Wolf, which at the time consisted of Wolf O'Donnell, Leon Powalski, Pigma Dengar, and Andrew Oikonny, and must defeat them at least once. After completing six stages, Star Fox can now go to Venom and strike back at Andross. Depending on the route taken to Venom, the battle against Andross will vary. If the previous stage was Bolse (Easy), a false robotic Andross serves as the final boss. However, after the credits, Andross is heard laughing, implying that he is still alive. However, if the team went through Area 6 (Hard), Andross will reveal his true form after a fight with his head and hands: a floating brain and two eyes. After defeating the brain, James McCloud (It is debated whether or not it is a ghost) leads his son out the the imploding base. Returning to Cornelia as heroes, Star Fox is offered membership into the Cornerian army but refuse, saying that they prefer "doing things our own way." After the credits roll, the Great Fox and Star Fox are shown flying off into the skies.After the credits, there is a bill from Star Fox to General Pepper which shows the number of enemies killed in the campaign multiplied by 64 resulting in the money due. If the price is under $70,000 (1093 enemies or fewer) General Pepper remarks, "This is one steep bill....but it's worth it." If the price is over $70,000 (1094 enemies or more) the general yells in shock "Whaaat?"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Star Fox 64 you play as Fox McCloud, leader of a group of mercenaries for hire named Star Fox. In most stages you pilot a ship called an Arwing, though in some stages you pilot a submarine called the Blue Marine or a tank called the Land Master. You move Fox McCloud's vehicle using the analog stick to maneuver around the screen and using the A button to shoot incoming enemies with lasers.Throughout the game, various power ups are available to help you accomplish each level. Silver rings would increase your health by a small increment. Gold rings, on the other hand, boosted your max heal by a significant portion if you managed to collect 3 of them on one stage, and if you collected an additional 3 after that, you would gain 1 extra life. Silver stars are the most valuable recovery item, since it recovers your health much more quickly.The Smart Bomb is another power up that is used to blow up numerous amounts of enemies in a single shot. These are used with the B button. Laser upgrades are also available that increase the power of your laser. However, once you've upgraded your laser twice, it is fully powered up and cannot be further upgraded.The game features a variety of alternate paths and endings depending on your choices made during the course of the game. Depending on if you accomplished a certain task on a mission, you will be given an option to take an alternate route to Venom. The game has 2 distinct endings, one where you enter Venom via the satellite Bolse, and the other where you enter Venom by attacking Area 6 directly.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]HeroesDescriptionAppearanceFox McCloud The game's protagonist and the leader of the Star Fox team. He is the son of the legendary Arwing pilot James McCloud.Fox McCloudPeppy Hare Long-time friend of James McCloud.

He is the only original member of the only original member of the Star Fox team to continue to serve on the team after the betrayal at Venom.Peppy HareSlippy Toad A childhood companion of Fox McCloud and slightly inexperienced in flying. He is usually the one to ask question or to "mess up" in flights. During boss fights, Slippy can reveal how much health the enemy has remaining.Slippy ToadFalco Lombardi A cocky, space-loving friend. He is very jealous of Fox McCloud as seen many times in the story line, making sarcastic remarks and trying to look very important. In certain sections of the game, saving Falco from enemies can open up paths leading to harder levels.Falco LombardiVillainsDescriptionAppearanceAndross The main antagonist and the one who is responsible for James McCloud's death, who is now attempting to take over the Lylat system. He lives on the planet Venom and thinks that he should rule the entire system.AndrossWolf O'Donnell The leader of the Star Wolf team, and the main rival for Fox McCloud. The team flies in the Wolfen, a ship considered roughly equal to that of the Arwing. He will attempt to shoot down Fox when fighting with Star Fox.Wolf O'DonnellPigma Dengar A former member of the Star Fox team, who betrayed his team to Andross. He has since joined the Star Wolf. He will pursue Peppy Hare during an encounter with Star Wolf.Pigma DengarLeon Powalski A very sly, cold, and devious pilot that is part of the Star Wolf Team. During any encounter with Star Wolf, he will chase after Falco.Leon PowalskiAndrew Oikonny The nephew of Andross and a member of the Star Wolf team. He stays on Slippy's tail during encounters with Star Wolf.Andrew OikonnyOthersDescriptionAppearanceJames McCloud Fox McCloud's father, and the original leader of the Star Fox team. Andross tortured him after Pigma's betrayal, and is assumed dead. He (or his spirit) helped Fox escape the collapsing ruins of Venom when Andross' true form was deafeated.James McCloudKatt Monroe She likes to flirt with Falco, and she has a crush on him. She is found on the planet Zoness, and will help you on Macbeth or Sector Z depending on what path is taken.Katt MonroeBill Grey The cheif officer of the Bulldog and Husky Squadrons on Corneria. Fox met him in the Cornerian Flight Academy, and they have been friends ever since. You'll meet Bill on planet Katina, and will assist you on Solar or Sector X depending on which path is taken.Bill Grey[CR]Vehicles[CR]There are multiple vehicles used by fox and his team during the game and these include:DescriptionVehicleGreat Fox The team's mother ship and staging area. The player never controls Great Fox, but each mission ends with the team returning to the ship.Great FoxArwing The Arwing is the main vehicle of choice the characters pilot, with its upgradable lasers, Smart Bombs and Barrel Rolls. In Star Fox 64 it also has the ability to fire a homing shot by centering the trigger on a target and holding down A until the targeting reticule flashes red of the target. The plane also gains the ability to do a somersault and a full 180 degree corkscrew-turn when fighting in "All-Range Mode", which usually referred to boss fights.ArwingLandmaster The Landmaster is a tank that debuts in Star Fox 64. Only used on the planets Macbeth and Titania, the Landmaster is a powerful land vehicle. Like the Arwing, it is able to do a barrel roll, fire smart bombs, and lock on to its targets. In addition, it can hover for a moment and boost.LandmasterBlue Marine The Blue Marine is a submarine that Star Fox has used only in Star Fox 64, and even then only on Aquas. The Blue Marine is unique among the other vehicles because it's B-Bomb equivalent, torpedoes, have unlimited ammunition. This is mainly because the sea floor is extremely dark and the torpedoes provide light for a few seconds after they explode. The blue marine has slight resemblance to Great Fox, although it is much smaller.Blue Marine[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Beginning StageDescriptionLevelCorneria Corneria is the first level of the game and the direction in which you beat the level decides which path you take through the galaxy. This is not permanent path though, and any "Mission Completes" instead of "Mission Accomplished" will bump you down to a lower path vice versa. The first path ends with fighting a humanoid Robot (blue path) and the second option is unlocked by saving Falco, who then shows you a giant ship behind a waterfall, which sends you on the red path.Planet CorneriaBlue Path (Easy)DescriptionLevelMeteo The team flies through an asteroid field, fighting enemies along the way. The blue path can be continued by fighting a giant ship at the end of the level, or jump to the yellow path by flying through a series of boost rings, warping the team to Katina.Meteo Asteroid FieldFichina A base with a bomb in that Star Fox must defuse. The team must defeat Star Wolf within the time limit to succeed. Successfully defeating Star Wolf within the limit takes the team to Solar.Planet FichinaSector X The player fights "Andross's Secret Weapon". If Slippy is killed by the boss, the player must deviate back to the blue path to save him. If Slippy survives, the team travels to Macbeth.Sector XTitania Fox uses the Landmaster to take out enemies oh his way to save Slippy from a plant monster. There is no alternate path.Planet TitaniaBolse The final stage of the "easy" routes before Venom. The player must destroy the station by shooting the yellow outcroppings on the generator. If they haven't fought Star Wolf already, they will encounter them here.Bolse SatelliteYellow Path (Medium)DescriptionLevelKatina Players try to save the military base on Katina from the enemy army by killing their forces and then eventually by destroying their mother ship and preventing it from destroying the base. Fox meets his old friend Bill, now a member of the Cornerian Army, on this planet. The level is a homage to the film Independence Day. Failing to save the base bumps the player to Sector X.Planet KatinaSolar The star of the Lylat System; Solar is a ball of molten lava. Players slowly lose health throughout the level due to the heat and therefore must continually pick up power ups. Flying close to or touching the lave caused additional harm to the Arwing. The boss is a lava monster who is known as the "Enemy Bio Weapon". There is no alternative path.SolarMacbetth Macbeth is the hub Andross's war effort, and the player's goal is to destroy a train full of Andross's weapons. They can either do this by shooting 8 switches (and then one final activation switch) that will set the train on a collision course with a building. Doing this will move you to the red path's Area 6. If you miss the switches, you must fight the conductor's flying robot that is tethered to the train. Defeating the robot will jump you to the blue path's Bolse.Planet MacbethRed Path (Hard)DescriptionLevelSector Y Players are asked to help fight a battle. Throughout the level, they must fight three Gundam-like robots. Destroying over a hundred enemies will give the player access to Aquas, while destroying under a hundred bumps the player to Katina.Sector YAquas Fox heads underwater to destroy an enemy clam monster/bio weapon. This is the only level so far in the franchise where the Blue Marine is used. There is no alternate path.Planet AquasZoness Players must fight through the planet, which is covered with toxic liquid, in order to destroy a pirate-like boss (who shoots cannon balls) at the end of the level. Katt, an old friend of Falco's, helps them team on this mission. Touching the polluted sea will damage the Arwing. In order proceed to Secotr Z, the player must destroy all the searchlights. Failure to do so bumps the player to Macbeth.Planet ZonessSector Z The team must defend Great Fox from six missiles while flying through Sector Z. If all the missiles are stopped, the player stay on the red path to Area 6. If one hits Great Fox, the Great Fox will be heavily damaged and you head to Bolse on the blue path.Sector ZArea 6 The player fight through three fleets, all of which are preparing to strike at the heart of the system, in order to get to Venom.Area 6Final StageDescriptionLevelVenomRoute 1 (Blue Path)The player must fight through a swarm of enemies and a temple boss before destroying Andross's face and hands. Once this is done, it is revealed that you are really fighting a robot and must destroy the robotic under-skeleton as well. Once this is done, the game is over, though it's heavily implied that Andross is still alive.Route 2 (Red Path)The player begins the stage at the end of Venom 1, and must fight an upgraded Star Wolf and their new ships without the aid of lock-on or B-Bombs. After this, they head through a maze without the assistance of their team in order to fight Andross and his true form; his brain. One his brain is destroyed, Andross tries to take the player down with him by bringing down the entire structure around them. At this point, Fox's father (it is debated whether he is a ghost or not) shows Fox the way out. After escaping, Fox's father disappears and the game is over.Planet Venom[CR]Unlockable Content[CR]On each stage, there is a high score that must be beaten in order to earn a medal for that specific course. If all of the medals were obtained, it would unlock a new expert difficulty mode to the main storyline. This mode is identical to the original game, except the difficulty has been increased significantly. If all of the medals were obtained in the expert mode of the game, a new title screen would be unlocked.In addition, you can unlock different multiplayer options by obtaining medals. If you obtain the Venom medal in normal mode, you can unlock the ability to play as a Landmaster. Likewise, if you obtain the Venom medal in expert mode, you unlock the ability to play on foot in the multiplayer mode.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Star Fox 64 contains a 4-player multiplayer mode that feature all-range mode. Players have to eliminate other players in order to win. Unlike the main game, there is only one Smart Bomb and one Laser Upgrade available for each course. Players use an Arwing to fight, but later can get the option of choosing to go in a Land Master or on foot once they unlock medals in the main game.There are three different matches available to play:Point Match- Where the first one to five kills winsBattle Royal- Last one standing winsTime Trial- To see how many enemy fighters you can shoot down within a time limit[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Star Fox 64 CD Cover ArtThe soundtrack has 39 tracks featured on one CD that is 64 minutes and 49 seconds long, and it was released on October 17, 1997 in Japan.

		<plot>Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth takes place in the far future, where you are the last hope for Earth, which is being attacked by an alien race.  The game features a top-down 3D scroller, similar to that of the arcade games 1943 or  Raiden.  You can take control of different space crafts, each with different advantages and disadvantages, and different weapons.  The rule is 1 hit-kill.  After 3 lives, you have to restart the level.  There is no saving feature, however a lengthy password is provided to you at the end of each level, so long you have the patience to put it in each time you turn off the game.[CR]Each level is about 3-5 minutes long, each with it's own tough boss at the end.  Each level has its own secret path to take, depending on what you shoot (ex. shoot wall, reveal secret path).  All levels lead up to a final boss in the end.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Mode Screen[CR]Beat the game under the Beginner Difficulty to gain a special title screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret levels[CR]In the game, there are some secret missions one can access by meeting certain criteria: [CR][B]Secret Mission 1: Destruction[/B] - In Mission 2: Corrosion, after destroying the first door inside the base, there are five floating towers--the outer four are blue and the center one is red. Shoot the blue towers and then the red one, and you'll open up an underground tunnel that eventually leads to the secret mission. [CR][B]Secret Mission 2: Scars:[/B] - About 1/5 into Mission 3: Invaded, several blue ships line up in front of a single red one. Destroy ONLY the red ship. Rather than enter the space station, you will fly over it and eventually enter the secret mission. [CR][B]Secret Mission 3: Reminiscence[/B] - In Mission 4; Pursuit, after passing by the series of launch bays but before entering the canyon, four blue ships will face you. Eventually, four red ships will line up behind the blue ones. Again, destroy only the red ships, avoiding the blue ones. Done correctly, your ship will change course and travel into a secret section of the canyon where your ship will be teleported to the secret mission.</plot>

		<title_clean>Star Wars - Rogue Squadron</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released on December 17 1998, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is the first in a series of space combat games for Nintendo platforms. Originally released on the Nintendo 64 and PC, the game was developed by Factor 5 and was published by LucasArts.[CR]Rogue Squadron was one of the first games to make use of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which updated the graphics and allowed players to play the game in high resolution. Rogue Squadron has spawned two sequels since it's release in 1998, the first being Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader released in September of 2001 for the Nintendo Gamecube and the second being Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike released in October in 2003 for the Gamecube.[CR]The game is known for its arcade style approach to starship dogfights, with Factor 5 taking influence from the original Star Wars cockpit arcade game. The game also has little resemblance to the novels for which the series is based, opting for Luke Skywalker to be the main character, rather than Wedge Antilles , the protagonist of the novels. The game also features full voice audio for character dialogue, a rarity for the Nintendo 64 at the time.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The Millennium Falcon flying over Mos Eisley.[CR]Luke, as mentioned, is the main character of Rogue Squadron, the only other playable character being Wedge during a bonus mission of the game. Hobbie and Janson also make an appearance as pilots for the Rebellion, as seen in The Empire Strikes Back. Crix Madine, a Rebel Alliance General by the time of Return of the Jedi, also plays a part in the game, as the player must assist his defection from the Galactic Empire. This incident occurs on Corellia, Han Solo's homeworld, and as expected, the space pirate makes a last minute appearance to help his friend Luke, similar to the end of A New Hope.[CR]Wedge plays a pivotal role as well, often being Luke's wing man, and keeping him updated on any threats or mission updates. General Rieekan, from Empire, serves as the commanding Rebel in constant communication with the flight team. He gives orders to Rogue Squadron, and often calls them back to base if the player fails the mission. Another important defection from the Imperials occurs during the course of Rogue Squdron.[CR] Kasan Moor, a pilot in the deadly 128th Imperial Squadron, acts upon her doubts of the Empire, eventually becoming a valuable aide to the Rebel cause. Her knowledge of hidden Imperial bases helps Rogue Squadron carry out several sabotage missions, crippling the Empire's forces. It is also hinted that Luke and Kasan are fond of each other, as Kasan is grateful for escaping Imperial influence, and Luke is able to see the good in her. The main adversary of the game is Moff Seerdon, bearing all of the characteristics of a typical evil Imperial officer. He gives commands to the Imperial Fighters, and spouts Imperial rhetoric reminiscent of the films to the opposing Rebels.[CR]Characters are not individually seen on screen, apart from their biographies in the game's menu. Rather, the game portrays its characters through the ships and vehicles that each one flies. Moff Seerdon is nearly always represented by a Tyderium Shuttle, and Kasan's defection is visualized in the transition from piloting a TIE Interceptor to an X-Wing. General Rieekan often rides in larger transport crafts, and Luke occupies the starfighter in the player's control.List of Characters Wedge Antilles Chewbacca  Han Solo Wes JansonDerek "Hobbie" KlivianCrix Madine Kasan Moor Dak RalterCarlist RieekanZev SenescaKohl Seerdon Luke Skywalker[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]An X-Wing, piloted by Luke Skywalker, escorts a supply group on the forested planet of Barkesh.[CR]The story of Rogue Squadron takes place between Episode IV and Episode V.[CR]The Rebellion is still making an effort to stay united, and resist Imperial takeover, while at the same time engaging in rescue and liberation missions.[CR]As the Rogue Squadron help General Madine and Kasan defect, Wedge is caught in his downed Y-Wing by Imperial forces on a mission from which the Rebels are forced to flee. Luke and Kasan launch a rescue attempt, allowing the Rebels to infiltrate the prisons of Kessel and free dozens of war prisoners.[CR]Moff Seerdon poses a threat to the recent Rebel successes, with each following Imperial defeat striking anger in the evil commander. Sederdon is finally defeated during his raid on civilian bacta facilities, where Luke and the rest of Rogue Squadron protect the innocent inhabitants and successfully take down Seerdon's shuttle.[CR]Locations[CR]The view from inside an X-Wing Fighter cockpit.[CR]Many of the locations in Rogue Squadron appear to be counterparts to the Original Trilogy's many planets. Each planet also consists of a single environment, as in all desert, all forest, or mostly water. For example, Barkesh shares many traits with Yavin IV, the Rebel base in A New Hope.[CR]Both planets are covered in jungle, and share similar ancient architecture. Talloran is a gas planet, with a floating city that looks very similar to Cloud City, and in fact Kasan comments on how she is reminded by Bespin during the mission.[CR]Fest is an all ice world, with Imperial Walkers as the empire's main force, echoing the planet Hoth from Empire. Chandrilla also borrows its architecture heavily from conceptual paintings of Alderaan, a planet unseen on film until 2005 in Revenge of the Sith. Hoth and Beggar's Canyon on Tatooine make appearances as bonus levels, as well as the Death Star's equatorial trench.[CR]Vehicles[CR]A group of Snowspeeders preparing to make an air-to-ground assault. [CR]Most of the Rebel and Imperial starfighters in the game remain true to their Star Wars canon traits. For example, the X-Wing is able to shift between attack position and cruise position by locking the S-Foils. The A-Wing is the fastest ship in the fleet, yet also the weakest in terms of shielding, as witnessed in Return of the Jedi; both attributes are similar to the TIE Interceptor, as also seen in Jedi. Used primarily for bombing and escort missions, the rock-solid Y-Wing sees plenty of use in both offensive and defensive missions; the ship's built in Ion Cannons are particularly helpful for disabling important enemy targets. Often employed on air-to-ground missions and quick assaults, the Snowspeeder is a useful craft for dealing with the formidable AT-AT walkers, as seen in The Empire Strikes Back. An expanded universe ship, the V-Wing makes an appearance as a flyable starfighter during the bonus mission featuring Wedge.[CR]Rogue Squadron features atmospheric battles only, as true space combat was not introduced until the following Factor 5 game,Battle for Naboo.[CR]Medals &amp; Cheats[CR]A Buick car model replaces the V-Wing model after a cheat code is used.[CR]Rogue Squadron features a medal system, where players are graded on their performance during a mission. Factors such as enemies killed, Rebels spared, and blaster hit ratio are taken into consideration before awarding the player either a bronze, silver, or gold medal. Medal count effects the player's status within the Rebel Alliance (i.e, recruit, commander, general) and also unlocks up to three bonus missions. This encourages the player to replay missions and score within the medal requirements.[CR]Factor 5 famously included the Naboo Starfighter during development nearly six months before the release of The Phantom Menace. The code to unveil the ship remained largely unknown until Factor 5 released instructions to the two step unlocking process close to the premier of Phantom Menace. Cheats[CR]for infinite lives, and even a music and starship gallery can be entered, allowing the player to casually view full 3D views of each starship in the game. Another interesting Easter egg in the game was the ability to pilot a flying 1969 Buick Electra 225, after inputting a specific code. Players can also unlock the Millennium Falcon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter these codes at the code menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Beggars Canyon Race[CR]Get bronze medals on all regular levels.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] Dash Rendar, the game's protagonist.[CR]Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire is a hybrid third-person shooter and flight combat game developed and published by  LucasArts for the  Nintendo 64 (on December 3, 1996) and  PC (on September 17, 1997).[CR]Part of the Star Wars expanded universe multimedia project of the same name (which also consisted of an original novel, comic books, a soundtrack, and toys), players control mercenary  Dash Rendar as he participates in the Battle of  Hoth (during the events of  Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back), attempts to rescue the frozen  Han Solo from  Boba Fett, recovers secret Imperial plans for the second Death Star (with help from  Luke Skywalker), and rescues  Princess Leia from the game's antagonist (and head of the Black Sun crime syndicate)  Prince Xizor.[CR]The game is the first Star Wars game released for the Nintendo 64 (and was released shortly after the console's release). The PC version, released a year later, replaced the use of still images for cutscenes with rendered animated cutscenes (and voiceovers). The game features an orchestral soundtrack, using both  John Williams's iconic themes from the original trilogy and themes from the officially licensed soundtrack (created by composer  Joel McNeely).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire tackles many different forms of gameplay. These include third-person shooter/platforming levels, maintaining turrets on his ship (the Outrider) in an  on-rails sequence, and total-control vehicle levels. Only the final level switches between different forms of gameplay mid-game.Shooter/Platforming Levels[CR]In most levels, the player controls Dash Rendar himself, running around and gunning stormtroppers, droids, and other enemies. The player can choose between third-person and limited first-person views. Dash uses a variety of weapons (though primarily his Laser Blaster, which has infinite ammo), including seeker missiles, flamethrowers, pulse cannons, stunners, and disruptors. In later levels, Dash obtains a rechargable  jetpack, which helps him fly over difficult platforming areas.[CR]The Shooter/Platforming levels and the Swoop Bike level contain "challenge points" which are scattered throughout the level, seen in the form of a rotating chrome  Rebel Alliance emblem. These are often put in hard-to-reach areas, encouraging the player to explore the vast levels. Collecting all of them in certain difficulty levels will allow certain codes and privileges to be triggered, including gaining all weapons and invincibility, changing to an  X-Wing or  TIE Fighter in the final level, and allowing  wampas to fight for you in the second level.On-Rails Turret Levels[CR]In some levels, the Outrider is piloted by Dash's robotic co-pilot,  Leebo, as Dash maintains the ship's guns. Hazards, such as asteroids and enemy ships, must be blasted before they damage the ship.Flight Levels [CR]There are three levels in which Dash maintains full control of a vehicle: the beginning of the game (where he pilots a  Snowspeeder), the middle of the game (where he controls a Swoop Bike), and the end of the game (where he pilots the Outrider).[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Part I - The Battle of HothBattle of Hoth - Dash arrives on Hoth with a shipment to the rebels, and Han Solo convinces him to join  Rogue Squadron. Dash must control a  Snowspeeder and take out probe droids and Imperial walkers.Escape From Echo Base - As the Imperial forces take over Echo Base, Dash must find his way to his ship, the Outrider, while facing  stormtroopers, probe droids,  wampas, and eventually an  AT-ST walker.The Asteroid Field - Dash and his robotic copilot,  Leebo, may have escaped Hoth, but they manage to fly towards a  Star Destroyer in the middle of an asteroid field. Dash must control the Outrider's turrets while shooting down  TIE Fighters,  TIE Bombers, and asteroids.Part II - In Search of Boba FettOrd Mantell Junkyard - In order for Dash to find Boba Fett, who is keeping a frozen Han Solo, he must find one of Fett's rival bounty hunters (and rogue assassin droid)  IG-88. Dash must ride hovertrains (and battle drones while jumping between trains) over to IG-88's location, and then battle him.Gall Spaceport - Dash finds out that Fett is hiding on an Imperial moon base. To avoid detection, he must hide the Outrider in a gorge and sneak in on foot to find him. Gall Spaceport is the longest stage in the game, taking over a half and hour to complete.Part III - Hunting the AssassinsMos Eisley and Beggar's Canyon -  Jabba the Hutt, under orders from Prince Xizor, sends a group of swoop bikers to  Obi-Wan Kenobi's old home, where Luke Skywalker is training. Dash must control a swoop bike and take out the bikers before they reach Luke.Imperial Freighter Suprosa - Luke informs Dash of an Imperial Freighter supposedly carrying secret Imperial construction plans. Dash must infiltrate it and recover the plans.Part IV - Lair of the Dark PrinceThe Sewers of Imperial City - The Outrider and the  Millenium Falcon have assembled in the sewers underneath the Imperial City, so they can rescue Princess Leia and blow up Prince Xizor's palace. Dash must navigate through the swears underneath the city, eventually battling a giant beast.Xizor's Palace - As Dash enters the palace, he must battle droids and guards so he can plant pulse bombs on a central structure. Before you escape from the palace, Dash must face Xizor's Gladiator Droid.The Skyhook Battle - Xizor flees to his space station, Skyhook. Dash must fly there and destroy its reactor core, where an epic space battle ensues. The level has two parts: a gunner part (similar to The Asteroid Field) and a total flight control part (similar to Battle of Hoth).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Saved Data Deletion Code[CR]Begin a new file, and enter your name as '' _WIPE_ALL_DATA''.

		<title_clean>Star Wars Episode I - Racer</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Star Wars: Episode I - Racer is a fast paced anti-gravity racing game based on the infamous "Pod Race" from The Phantom Menace movie. The player can reach extremely high speeds and use quick reflexes to dodge oncoming racers and obstacles. The racer begins each of the three lap races with three lives, meaning that in contrast to the film crashing doesn't mean your race is over, but is more of a minor setback. Once the lives are all used up, however, the racer is disqualified. Alongside the home console (of which just the N64 version was published by Nintendo) and computer versions, a port for the Game Boy Color was released with entirely different tracks, but similar core gameplay. Of greater note is Star Wars: Racer Arcade (developed jointly by Sega AM5 [later renamed Sega Rosso] and Lucasarts), which put the public in the seat of Anakin Skywalker's Pod with a cockpit shaped control deck. Two levers were used to control the game, mirroring events in the film. There are only four tracks in the Arcade, many less than the other versions.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: While the characters are given individual backstories which show some to be inexperienced or unmotivated to seek victory, the game treats them all as dedicated and talented racers.[CR]Anakin Skywalker[CR]A hero from the film which the game is based on. Anakin is a young human, notable for being the only of his race capable of participating in the dangerous game of podracing.[CR]Sebulba[CR]Sebulba, a Dug, is a popular and successful racer who worked his way to the top by cheating. He is the only racer in the game to have a weapon. When using Sebulba's taunt, a flamethrower spouts out sideways.[CR]Bozzie Baranta[CR]Once a mechanic for Gasgano, Bozzie chose to become a racer. He was fairly successful in this venture.[CR]Aldar Beedo[CR]While Aldar Beedo is a talented racer, his first priority is his work as a hitman, taking out racers to pave the way to victory for whoever pays for his services.[CR]Toy Dampner[CR]Dampner is a menacing pilot. While he is known to race elsewhere, he prefers the tracks of Oovo IV, where he is a crowd favorite.[CR]Dud Bolt[CR]A racer hired by Sebulba who is paid per race based on how many competing pods he is able to take out.[CR]Gasgano[CR]An experienced and talented racer who does not hesitate to take out racers who get in his way.[CR]Mars Guo[CR]A loudmouth braggart with a fondness for gambling and drinking. While he is a competent racer, his tendency to anger other racers often leads to his downfall.[CR]Ebe Endocott[CR]Once a daredevil delivery man, Endocott was encouraged by his boss to take up podracing, where his daredevil ways and piloting skills let him achieve some success.[CR]Cy Yunga[CR]A talented racer with an advanced pod. Yunga is only available in-game through a cheat code, causing him to replace "Bullseye" Navior.[CR]Ratts Tyerell[CR]Ratts Tyerell is a racer who gained success for his swift reflexes. He owns one of the largest podracers in the circuit.[CR]Fud Sang[CR]A somewhat mediocre and unknown racer, who nevertheless is paranoid of being sabotaged by his opponents.[CR]Boles Roor[CR]A podracer who also excels at singing, Roor pilots an outdated podracer that nevertheless boasts a high top speed.[CR]Ark "Bumpy" Roose[CR]Roose is a particularly dim-witted pilot who is known for indiscriminately ramming into opposing racers.[CR]Wan Sandage[CR]Sandage is a podracer who gained a great deal of fame on his homeworld of Ord Radama. However, he is less successful on other planets, where he suffers from disorientation.[CR]Jinn Reeso[CR]Little is known about Jinn Reeso. He is only available for use through a cheat code, causing him to replace Mars Guo.[CR]Ben Quadinaros[CR]Quadinaros is an inexperienced racer, racing out of his league with an experimental four-engine pod.[CR]Slide Paramita[CR]Paramita is an elitist racer who uses a small pod. He disapproves of racers who use bulky podracers.[CR]Mawhonic[CR]A very talented racer who sells parts in his spare time.[CR]"Bullseye" Navior[CR]Navior is a talented pilot who gained the nickname "Bullseye" for his unique looking eyes.[CR]Teemto Pagalies[CR]Despite being a drunkard, Pagalies is one of the least corrupt racers in the sport. He is a crowd pleaser, known for performing daring stunts during races.[CR]Ody Mandrell[CR]Mandrell is a racer who participates not for money, but for an adrenaline rush. His tough skin lets him survive otherwise deadly crashes.[CR]Neva Kee[CR]Neva Kee stands out among the other racers for his unique podracer. Its engines are attached directly to the cockpit and jut out behind it. This makes the cockpit the frontmost part of the pod, greatly increasing the risk of death in a crash.[CR]Elan Mak[CR]Elan Mak is actually a bounty hunter named Kam Nale. He joined the podracing circuit in order to hunt down Aldar Beedo. When he discovered his talent for the sport, he became involved with it beyond his initial intention to only use it as a front to catch Beedo.[CR]Clegg Holdfast A reporter for Podracing Quarterly, Holdfast participates in races primarily in order to get an inside scoop. Despite his ulterior motives, he showed himself to be a talented racer.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]N64, Dreamcast, PC and Mac Versions:[CR]There are four main modes within the game. The single player story mode, called "Tournament", is a sequence of championships of increasing difficulty composed of several races each in which the player competes for trophies. New tracks, racers and upgrades are unlocked by playing through it and Credits earned by winning races allows you to add new parts to your Pod. The difficulty level in Tournament mode can't be set. Free Race mode is essentially the exhibition mode in which players compete in single races but can't unlock rewards, however the level of the opponents' challenge can be determined. Time Attack is no different to any other mode with this name, as the player attempts to beat a track as quickly as possible. There is also a local two player mode, and the level and number of AI racers can be altered.[CR]Planets[CR]Tatooine[CR]Only two of the game's courses are found in Tatooine. The first is the Boonta Training Course, an easy map that acquaints players with the game. The second is the Boonta Classic, which is a relatively faithful recreation of the racetrack from the movie.[CR]Mon Gazza[CR]Mon Gazza is a Mars-like world with vast red deserts, crowded but small cities, and lava pits. Tracks here often involve large open spaces that quickly turn to narrow corridors.[CR]Ando Prime[CR]Ando Prime is an ice world. Tracks here take players through numerous caves, and often take them across slick, icy surfaces. Many tracks in this world feature a shortcut that opens up in laps 2 and on, in which the racer may turn left immediately past the finish line and enter a tent that hides a tunnel.[CR]Aquilaris[CR]Aquilaris is composed largely of water, and its tracks take place largely in the infrastructure built on the water. Players are taken through underwater tunnels through which massive fish may be seen.[CR]Malastare[CR]Malastare is a dark world with many sharp turns and visual obstructions such as gas and rocky pillars. Tracks here are narrow and unforgiving.[CR]Baroonda[CR]Baroonda is a jungle world. Players race through a variety of environments here, including thick rain forests, beaches, and a volcano.[CR]Ord Ibanna[CR]Racetracks on Ord Ibanna are all located on infrastructure floating in a cloudy sky. These tracks often feature elevated shortcuts that are difficult to stay on because they are narrow.[CR]Oovo IV[CR]Oovo IV is a large, asteroid-like world. Players race through open expanses along with urban areas. The highest speeds achievable in the game are found here in anti-gravity tunnels.[CR]Track Overview[CR]There are several tracks on each of the available planets, and every racer has at least one signature track. There are 25 tracks in total, divided into four categories: Amatuer, Semi-Pro, Galactic, and Invitational.Tracks in order of appearance:[CR]Boonta Training Course[CR]Planet - Tatooine[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - SebulbaPod Racing![CR]Mon Gazza Speedway[CR]Planet - Mon Gazza[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Teemto Pagalies[CR]Beedo's Wild Ride[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Aldar Beedo[CR]Aquilaris Classic[CR]Planet - Aquilaris[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Clegg Holdfast[CR]Malastare 100[CR]Planet - Malastare[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Dud Bolt[CR]Vengeance[CR]Planet - Oovo IV[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Fud Sang[CR]Spice Mine Run[CR]Planet - Mon Gazza[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Mars Guo / Jinn Reeso[CR]Sunken City[CR]Planet - Aquilaris[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - "Bullseye" Navior / Cy Yunga[CR]Howler Gorge[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Ratts Tyerell[CR]Dug Derby[CR]Planet - Malastare[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Elan MakMore Pod Racing![CR]Scrapper's Run[CR]Planet - Ord Ibanna[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Wan Sandage[CR]Zugga Challenge[CR]Planet - Mon Gazza[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Boles Roor[CR]Baroo Coast[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Neva Kee[CR]Bumpy's Breakers[CR]Planet - Aquilaris[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Ark "Bumpy" Roose[CR]Executioner[CR]Planet - Oovo IV[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Toy Dampner[CR]Sebulba's Legacy[CR]Planet - Malastare[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Sebulba[CR]Grabvine Gateway[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Anakin Skywalker[CR]Andobi Mountain Run[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Mawhonic[CR]Dethro's Revenge[CR]Planet - Ord Ibanna[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Ody Mandrell[CR]Fire Mountain Rally[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Ebe Endocott[CR]Boonta Classic[CR]Planet - Tatooine[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Sebulba[CR]Ando Prime Centrum[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Slide Paramita[CR]Abyss[CR]Planet - Ord Ibanna[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Bozzie Baranta[CR]The Gauntlet[CR]Planet - Oovo IV[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Gasgano[CR]Inferno[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Ben Quadinaros[CR]Even though the planets host multiple races, it does not mean that those races are at all similar.[CR]Attribute Overview[CR]Each pod has 15 total attributes that determine its racing performance.

		<plot>In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the edge of the galaxy. Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come.[CR]The N64 port of StarCraft is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks the cutscenes and map editor of the original game.[CR]If the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire Brood Wars expansion is also available. One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode (with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.</plot>

		<title_clean>Stunt Racer 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]OVERVIEW[CR]Stunt Racer 64 is a racing game, released on the 64 in 2000. Developed by Boss Game Studios and published by Midway.[CR]GAMEPLAY[CR]Stunt Racer consists of racing classic cars that have been modified to perform certain tricks, by using mounted jets.[CR]Campaign[CR]Stunt Racer 64 has a standard racing story/campaign mode and consists of racing through 5 different leagues. Each league consists of a few races against the AI, and a final race against a "boss" like character, the league owner. Points are gained through winning races win and money is earned by completing each race, complete, the higher the position, the greater the reward. Points work in a similar way to many other racing games that involve grand prix style racing, like in Mario Kart, the position held are at the end of each race decides how many points will be won win for that race. If in first place by points at the end of the races, a challenge is opened up to race the owner of the league. The owner possesses a special car which is not upgradeable, but is unique in that none of the normal computer characters use them, and are received for free.[CR]The five leagues are:Kid Cola's LeagueBunny's LeagueHill Bully's LeagueBig John's LeagueDr. Death's League[CR]In addition to the campaign mode, there is also the option to play against either computers, or up to 3 other players in the quick race mode, which is just like a normal campaign race, but without any point or money rewards. However, the added stress on the N64 caused by the multiple players forces the game to have to remove certain elements of the game, such as some scenery, and even music and sound effects when racing with 3 or 4 players.[CR]TRACKS[CR]SR64's courses are perhaps the most unique aspect of the game. Where most games had courses with little to no eye candy, the areas around the course were boring and uninteresting, SR64's courses feature animated objects all over the course, the track designs flow rather than jerk around like in sim games, and sometimes seem to be coming from a young child's imagination, being almost caricatures of the theme or location they are based on.Soda Mountain[CR]The first race in contest mode, a roller coaster like ride through a mountain littered with all types of sweets : Gingerbread men, ice cream cones, ice cream sandwiches, etc. The qualifier at the beginning of the career takes place here.Giant ToysSoda Mountain[CR]Perhaps the most memorable of all SR64 courses, this course features toys galore, ranging from giant laughing Teddy Bears, to huge wobbling block towers, to a gigantic train set, and much more.Medieval Mayhem[CR]A race through what one would believe to be a toddler's idea of Medieval times, firebreathing dragons, castles, and huge flailing battleaxes awaits.Wild West Ruckus[CR]It's the Old West, Indian villages, steam engines, sharp corners through gold mines, and precarious drops make this course fairly challenging.Tacky Tiki[CR]A collection of stereotypical Carribean culture, the sharks, pirate ships, and clear blue ocean water are all here.House Of Horrors[CR]A night race in and out of a haunted house, watch out, Frankenstein, a giant spider and the undead will be after all racers.Creepy Carnie[CR]Want to go to the fair? Where there are clowns on stilts that sprays fire, out of control ferris wheels, precarious rollercoasters, and a deadly merry-go-round?Nautical Adventure[CR]The only underwater race in SR64, submarine bases, schools of fish, and attacking sharks can be seen here.Planet X[CR]Signs that warn the player of the constantly watching overlords, people slaving away at building monuments, and a high-tech community, make this course reminescent of many Sci-Fi books.Space Race[CR]The most unique course yet, rocket ships are all over, there is a huge city in space, and the player will even ride on the rings of Saturn in this fast-paced course.Retro Metro[CR]The final course in SR64, and undoubtedly the toughest, it's a race through a futuristic city flying in the sky, high jumps, shortcuts, and harrowing drops make this course a challenge to beat.Half-pipe*[CR]A 4-way half-pipe, great for practicing stunts and tricks.Stunt Bowl*[CR]Another stunt track, this course features ramps and slanted walls the player can drive on, a bit less suited to doing stunts as the player gets less air time off the ramps than on half-pipe.[CR]* Only playable in Quick Race mode.[CR]CARS[CR]When a new career is started, the player is able to select one of four starter cars, and as the player progresses and earns cash, other cars can be purchased. Once a bought car is fully upgraded, a "custom" version becomes available, with enhanced stats and more unique styling, these cars cannot be upgraded. Listed next to the car is it's custom equivalent.STARTER CARS[CR]Z-Bucket ---&gt; Blown Z-Bucket (Custom "hotrod" Ford Model T)[CR]Warbird Light ---&gt; Warbird Heavy (Ford Thunderbird, First Generation)[CR]Del Raye ---&gt; Del Raye Custom (Chevrolet Bel Air, Model year: 1959)[CR]Stottlemeyer ---&gt; Stottlemeyer EX (Studebaker Commander, Model year: 1950)CARS FOR PURCHASE[CR]Apollo 1 ---&gt; Apollo 2 (Classic 50's rocket looking styling, front resembles a 48'-51' Studebaker Starlight)[CR]Surf South ---&gt; Surf North (Known as a "Woody", 2 door coupe with wood trim.)[CR]Fuzz ---&gt; Super Fuzz (Oldsmobile 88, Police car, Model year: 1954)[CR]Desperado ---&gt; Desperado Deluxe (Cadillac Eldorado, Model year: 1959)[CR]Bumpkin ---&gt; Atomic Bumpkin (A rusted Ford model A pickup truck)[CR]Scimitar ---&gt; Scimitar Insane (Limosuine like luxury car, resembles a Mercedes-Benz)[CR]Cockroach ---&gt; Cockroach Extreme (Volkswagen Beetle)[CR]Hysterion ---&gt; Hyperion (Plymouth Prowler)UNLOCKABLE CARS[CR]Twisted Edge[CR]A snowboard floating between a set of wheels.

		<plot>[CR]Based on a set of popular toys of robots that can shoot marbles from their stomachs, Super B-Daman was meant to be a light gun shooter where the player can be in control of one of there robots. The players would select from a cast of robot characters and then plays a variety of mini-game type modes each with their own set of controls. You can compete against computer controlled AI characters or against another player. When playing against the computer you must earn more points to move onto the next mini-game.   [CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR] Dino Chase:  You sit backwards in a car being driven away from two dinosaurs that are chasing after you. You must shoot marbles into their mouths to earn points, each miss causes the dinosaur to reach out and bite you. You have no control of the car and can only aim left or right.  Mine Car Shooting: Riding in a mine car, which you have no control over, going through different colored tunnels you must aim with the analog stick a shoot down plus and minus signs to earn points.   Pool Battle: Sitting on top of a pool table you must shoot pool balls into the pockets. After your turn, the character you control turns into a pool ball allowing the other players the chance to shoot you into one of the pockets knocking you out of the game.  Power Crash: You are at a shooting range shooting down random polygonal shapes flying at the screen.   Mole Attack: Similar to "whack a mole", you must shoot moles popping up from underground holes. You can also shoot balls to earn points.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario 64 was the original launch and pack-in title for the Nintendo 64. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto's team at Nintendo EAD, it was released alongside the console on September 29th, 1996 in North America. The game pioneered many elements of the 3D subgenre of platformer. The game sold over 11.8 million copies worldwide and was also one of the first N64 games available for the Wii's Virtual Console collection of retro releases.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Princess Peach's invitation to Mario.[CR]The plot of Super Mario 64 starts off with Mario arriving at Princess Peach's castle at her invitation and promise of cake. However, upon arriving, he finds the castle nearly deserted and learns that the evil Bowser has once again abducted her. In order to stop Bowser and rescue the princess, Mario must explore the worlds within a series of paintings hanging in various rooms throughout the castle and collect the power stars hidden in each. Only once he has the necessary stars will he be able to face off against Bowser and save Peach.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]BasicsMario is introduced to the third dimension in Super Mario 64.[CR]Super Mario 64 takes the core concepts of the 2D Super Mario titles and applies them to a 3D space. The player takes control of Mario and runs, jumps, swims, and flies through the games various stages in order to complete challenges and collect power stars. The game uses Peach's castle as a hub world; within the castle, there are paintings that transport Mario to various worlds that contain power stars. As the player collects more power stars, more regions of the castle become available with new paintings to explore. By ultimately collecting enough stars, the player is able to access the final level in which Bowser resides for the final showdown.Controls[CR]Mario's movements are controlled using the controller's analog stick. Gentle tilts of the stick cause Mario to move at a walking pace, while tilting further causes him to break into a run. Pressing the A Button allows Mario to jump, and for the first time in the Super Mario series, he can perform actions such as a wall jump, a jumping backflip, and a running triple jump.Mario performing a backflip.Mario going for a swim.Walking - Press the analog stick gently in the desired direction.Running - Press the analog stick all the way in the desired direction.Wall Hug - Hold the analog stick at the same angle as the wall to slide along it.Jump - Press A to jump.Double Jump - Press A to jump and then again after returning to the ground to jump higher than the first jump.Triple Jump - Same as double jump but with a third jump added after returning to the ground.

At the top press up to do a hand stand on the pole and then A to jump off it.Flying - While wearing the Winged Cap triple jump or launch out of a cannon to start flying and use the control stick to steer. Z will cause Mario to butt stomp out of flying.Camera ControlsLakitu, traditionally an enemy of Mario, serves as the game's camera operator.[CR]Super Mario 64 was an early example of a game that offered the player manual control over the camera. The C Buttons on the N64 controller could nudge the camera to provide a better view of the action, while the C Up button zoomed the camera in to view the world from Mario's eyes.[CR]Lakitu, a character commonly seen in the Super Mario series as one of Mario's enemies, has a new role in Super Mario 64 as the game's cameraman. At times when the player is viewing Mario's reflection in a mirrored surface, Lakitu can also be seen behind him, holding the camera if the viewing angle is right.[CR]Presentation[CR]As the first polygonal Super Mario title, Super Mario 64's graphics were a significant change from the sprite art of Super Mario World. Super Mario 64 is also the first Mario title to feature voice acting. Mario's voice in the game is provided by Charles Martinet, who to date has provided the character's voice in every Mario title with vocals.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]LevelDescriptionBob-omb's BattlefieldBob-omb's Battlefield is comprised of green grassy fields, deep ravines, a high spiraling mountain plateau, and a floating island in the sky. It is ruled by the King Bob-omb, found atop the mountain, and his army of bob-ombs. Five cannons littered across the level make for easy traveling, but beware Wan Wan, a giant Chain-Chomp chained to a pole in the center.Whomp's FortressWhomp's Fortress is a huge floating island with a tower in the center and many smaller floating islands all around. This level is easy to fall from, and can be difficult to navigate for beginners. A tower appears after Mario defeats the evil Button King, a giant wall that tries to crush its opponents. Some enemies to watch out for are the sleeping piranha plants and mini button minions. There is also a friendly owl that will take Mario for a ride if found. This level was remade and appears again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 as part of the Throwback Galaxy.Jolly Roger BayJolly Roger Bay is an aquatic level with a deep underwater cave hiding buried treasure, sunken ships, and giant electric eels. Clams hide coins which help replenish Mario's health and prevent him from drowning. Use the metal cap to walk along the bottom of the ocean and find the turtle shell to rocket through the water.Cool, Cool MountainCool, Cool Mountain is a giant spiraling ice mountain. Mario can slide down the mountain side or go in the ski lodge chimney and race a giant penguin. Watch out for the baby penguin. Mario will want to help it back to its mother andwhile he's at it find the snowman head a new body.Bowser In The Dark WorldBowser In The Dark World is the first of three Bowser levels. This level is linear and has only one path to Bowser's lair. Only one star is obtainable in this level: a reward for collecting 8 red coins. At the top, the player must enter the green pipe and fight Bowser for the Key to the Basement. To defeat Bowser, the player must grab him by the tail and throw him into one of the bombs surrounding the arena.Big Boo's HauntBig Boo's Haunt is a level hidden inside a boo in the castle courtyard. It is a giant haunted house with many ghosts and secret rooms. Mario will have to fight Big Boos for their stars throughout the mansion, such as on a giant merry go round in the basement. Go around the back of the mansion for a secret door. Large eyeball enemies that appear in this world can be defeated if if Mario run circles around them to make them dizzy.Hazy Maze CaveHazy Maze Cave is a set of underground caverns. There are rolling boulders to dodge, fiery pits to jump, and tunnels filled with poison. Deep within this complex is a tranquil lake with a friendly dinosaur creature called Nessie who will help Mario navigate to a star, as well as the secret green P switch that unlocks green boxes. After obtaining it Mario will be able to use the metal cap to turn into Metal Mario.Lethal Lava LandLethal Lava Land is an ocean of lava with platforms and set pieces jutting up out of it. Mario must leap from platform to platform and avoid falling in the lava. This can be difficult, as many of the enemies try to bump Mario off, and some of the platforms move. In the center is a volcano that conceals a giant inner chamber.Shifting Sand LandShifting Sand Land is a giant desert with a huge pyramid in the center. It has many deadly sand traps and powerful sand whirlwinds which will throw Mario through the air. The pyramid is filled with obstacles, and two giant stone hands with eyes wait in the dark to crush Mario. There is also a giant vulture flying through the sky who is holding onto a star and can steal Mario's hat. When hatless, Mario's defense is reduced and he takes more damage.Dire Dire DocksDire Dire Docks is a water level with a huge whirlpool and a docked submarine. There is also a giant shark that Mario should avoid. Once the second Bowser stage has been completed, the submarine will mysteriously disappear.Bowser In The Fire SeaBowser In The Fire Sea is much like Lethal Lava Lands in that it is a giant lava ocean. The level extends vertically up out of the lava so that a misstep will send Mario falling into a fiery pit. Like the first Bowser level, Bowser In The Fire Sea is linear and it too has a red coins star. At the top is spirally portal that will lead to Mario's second encounter with Bowser, who holds the key for the upstairs. This battle sees Bowser with a few new tricks, but he can be defeated once again by throwing him into the bombs lining the battlefield.Snowman's LandSnowman's Land is a snow level with a huge snowman in the center. Mario can scale the snowman but should watch that he isn't blown off by the snowman's powerful breath. Mario will lose his hat if he is. The lake is frigid and will slowly damage Mario, but a skilled player can jump on the flower hatted snowmen to fly over it.Wet-Dry WorldWet-Dry world is a very vertical level. Mario can scale the cliffs and floating platforms to adjust the water level using switches. The water level present at the stage's start is dependent on whether Mario makes a high or low jump through the painting to enter the stage. There is a hidden town with a bell tower though an underwater tunnel.Tall, Tall MountainTall, Tall Mountain is all about scaling a large mountain surrounded by an abyss. There are many places where if Mario falls he will be taken back to the bottom or lose a life. There is a mischievous monkey that can steal Mario's hat and a sliding challenge much like the earlier snow lodge sledding course. Some of the most difficult tasks have Mario jumping across huge toadstools growing from the abyss around the mountain.Tiny-Huge IslandThis appropriately named level has features that allow Mario to transition between tiny and huge sizes. Depending on Mario's size, the player can affect the environment in different ways. The level has a grassy mountain in the center which can be difficult to scale. The wind is dangerous in this level and can cause Mario to fall to his doom. A giant Wiggler, an easy-to-anger centipede-like creature with boots, lives at the top of the mountain.Tick Tock ClockTick Tock Clock is a level consisting of the inside of a clock. The level requires Mario to ascend a hexagonal structure dodging swinging pendulums and riding conveyor belts and clock hands. Depending on what time it is on the clock when Mario enters the level, the level's obstacles change speed. Certain speeds will make certain stars easier to obtain.Rainbow RideRainbow Ride takes place high up in the sky and has Mario flying on magic carpets and swaying air ships. There is a giant mansion in the sky complete with a fire place and table. This course is very difficult as a single misstep will send Mario to his death.Bowser In The SkyBowser In The Sky is linear like its predecessors and also has a red coins star. It is the longest and arguably hardest of the Bowser levels and at the top is a pipe that leads Mario to his final confrontation with the Koopa King. To defeat Bowser this time Mario must launch him into three bombs instead of just one. After Bowser is hit two times the land next to the bombs falls away leaving the arena in the shape of a star. This makes the last throw to kill Bowser more difficult as it must be done from farther away. When Bowser is destroyed, Mario is awarded with a giant star and Princess Peach is rescued.[CR]Items[CR]Super Mario 64 excludes many of the franchise's classic items, such as the super mushroom and fire flower, in favor of special hats that give Mario unique abilities for a limited time. These caps include the metal cap that make him invulnerable and able to walk on the ocean floor, the vanish cap that allows him to pass through certain barriers, and the wing cap that lets him fly.[CR]However, some classic Mario items do make a return. These include the 1-up mushroom, Koopa shell, and collectible coins, though the functions of coins and shells are different compared to previous Super Mario games. In Super Mario 64, Koopa shells are rare and can be used to surf across the ground and destroy enemies, while collecting coins can restore Mario's health gauge. There are also three types of coins, yellow, blue, and red, worth one, two, and five health points respectively. Additionally, each world contains eight red coins, and collecting all eight during one visit earns Mario a power star.[CR]Development[CR]Super Mario 64 CG artwork[CR]Shigeru Miyamoto began work on a 3D iteration of the Mario franchise after working on Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. For a time he considered developing it for the Super Nintendo, but later decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the limitations of the SNES's hardware. The team spent many of the first months developing the camera and how the gameplay would work.[CR]Originally the game levels were to be linear, but it was later decided that they should be open, free-roaming environments. However, the concept of linear levels can still be seen in final game in the Bowser levels, which require Mario to traverse a set path of obstacles to reach Bowser's lair. The development team prioritized making Mario's movements feel fluid and natural.[CR]Before any levels were created, they tested his movements in a simple grid level which featured a golden bunny named "MIPS". This character later made an appearance in the final game. When the levels were finally designed, they incorporated more puzzles than was typically associated with Mario games. This is probably because The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was in development at the same time but was not released until years later. Some of its puzzle ideas were likely incorporated into Mario 64.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Super Mario 64 was composed by renowned Nintendo composer Koji Kondo. It was first published by Pony Canyon in Japan on July 19, 1996. It was later published in North America by Nintendo on November 1st, 1996.Super Mario 64 Original SoundtrackIt's a me, Mario!Title ThemePeach's MessageOpeningSuper Mario 64 Main ThemeSliderInside the Castle WallsLooping StepsDire, Dire DocksLethal Lava LandSnow MountainHaunted HouseMerry-Go-RoundCave DungeonPirahna Plant's LullabyPowerful MarioMetallic MarioFile SelectCorrect SolutionToad's MessagePower StarRace FanfareStar Catch FanfareGame StartCourse ClearGame OverStage BossKoopa's MessageKoopa's RoadKoopa's ThemeKoopa ClearUltimate KoopaUltimate Koopa ClearEnding DemoStaff RollPirahna Plant's Lullaby-Piano[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Super Mario 64 is one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful video games of all time. It was the top selling Nintendo 64 game and is the second highest selling Wii Virtual Console game. As of the end of 2007, it has sold 11.8 million copies world wide. The game is often praised as having revolutionized the 3D platformer and for pioneering many of the key gameplay concepts used in modern platforming games.[CR]DS Remake[CR]A remake of Super Mario 64 entitled Super Mario 64 DS was released for the original DS handheld on November 20, 2004. The game is faithful to the original version and contains all of the original levels. Additions made to the game include a variety of new minigames, as well as the ability to play the game as Luigi, Yoshi, or Wario.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Yoshi on the Castle roof topThe fastest recorded completion time for Super Mario 64 is 6 minutes and 41 seconds. This run makes use of various glitches in the game that make the game beatable with zero stars.Collecting all 120 stars in the game grants access to the castle roof, where players can meet Yoshi, who gives Mario 99 lives and a flashy new triple jump, along with a friendly message. Bowser's final message to Mario upon his defeat also changes if Mario has collected all 120 stars.Super Mario 64 marks the first time that Peach is referred to by her original Japanese name in the Super Mario series and the last in which she is referred to by her original western localized name, Princess Toadstool. The very first game to see a western release using Peach's original name was the Super NES game Yoshi's Safari.Not counting Yoshi's Island, this is one of the few times that Shy Guy enemies appear in a mainline Mario game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] A Bob-omb Magic Trick[CR]Go to Shifting Land Land and do the "Another place for a second hat" trick. Now go back to the start and pick up a Bob-omb. He'll magically disappear, and you are holding your hat! The smoke sounds wil still be there, but Mario will be holding his red cap like a Bob-omb. Don't press B and wait. Woah! The ticking sound stopped, and no explosion happened. Where did the bomb go? Now, go to one of those tornados in the quick sand and keep on going into it until---the Bob-omb comes out of you and explodes! Cogratulations! Mario has done his first magic trick!  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bob-omb Battlefield Warp 1[CR]There is a warp in Bob-omb Battlefield that lets you get from one side of the level to another quickly. After going up the first slanted bridge, go right and stand in the flower bed. The game will warp you to another flower bed, near the mountain. You can also warp from the flower bed next to the mountain to the flower bed next to the slanted bridge.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Ice Slide in Cool, Cool Mountain[CR]When doing the ice slide if you stay on the slide and follow the coins (a certain patch of coins won't follow the slide and will instead point to a wall) you will go into a secret tunnel hidden in the wall where you can get 2 one-up mushrooms and get to the finish line quicker.</plot>

The C Buttons on the N64 controller could nudge the camera to provide a better view of the action, while the C Up button zoomed the camera in to view the world from Mario's eyes.[CR]Lakitu, a character commonly seen in the Super Mario series as one of Mario's enemies, has a new role in Super Mario 64 as the game's cameraman. At times when the player is viewing Mario's reflection in a mirrored surface, Lakitu can also be seen behind him, holding the camera if the viewing angle is right.[CR]Presentation[CR]As the first polygonal Super Mario title, Super Mario 64's graphics were a significant change from the sprite art of Super Mario World. Super Mario 64 is also the first Mario title to feature voice acting. Mario's voice in the game is provided by Charles Martinet, who to date has provided the character's voice in every Mario title with vocals.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]LevelDescriptionBob-omb's BattlefieldBob-omb's Battlefield is comprised of green grassy fields, deep ravines, a high spiraling mountain plateau, and a floating island in the sky. It is ruled by the King Bob-omb, found atop the mountain, and his army of bob-ombs. Five cannons littered across the level make for easy traveling, but beware Wan Wan, a giant Chain-Chomp chained to a pole in the center.Whomp's FortressWhomp's Fortress is a huge floating island with a tower in the center and many smaller floating islands all around. This level is easy to fall from, and can be difficult to navigate for beginners. A tower appears after Mario defeats the evil Button King, a giant wall that tries to crush its opponents. Some enemies to watch out for are the sleeping piranha plants and mini button minions. There is also a friendly owl that will take Mario for a ride if found. This level was remade and appears again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 as part of the Throwback Galaxy.Jolly Roger BayJolly Roger Bay is an aquatic level with a deep underwater cave hiding buried treasure, sunken ships, and giant electric eels. Clams hide coins which help replenish Mario's health and prevent him from drowning. Use the metal cap to walk along the bottom of the ocean and find the turtle shell to rocket through the water.Cool, Cool MountainCool, Cool Mountain is a giant spiraling ice mountain. Mario can slide down the mountain side or go in the ski lodge chimney and race a giant penguin. Watch out for the baby penguin. Mario will want to help it back to its mother andwhile he's at it find the snowman head a new body.Bowser In The Dark WorldBowser In The Dark World is the first of three Bowser levels. This level is linear and has only one path to Bowser's lair. Only one star is obtainable in this level: a reward for collecting 8 red coins. At the top, the player must enter the green pipe and fight Bowser for the Key to the Basement. To defeat Bowser, the player must grab him by the tail and throw him into one of the bombs surrounding the arena.Big Boo's HauntBig Boo's Haunt is a level hidden inside a boo in the castle courtyard. It is a giant haunted house with many ghosts and secret rooms. Mario will have to fight Big Boos for their stars throughout the mansion, such as on a giant merry go round in the basement. Go around the back of the mansion for a secret door. Large eyeball enemies that appear in this world can be defeated if if Mario run circles around them to make them dizzy.Hazy Maze CaveHazy Maze Cave is a set of underground caverns. There are rolling boulders to dodge, fiery pits to jump, and tunnels filled with poison. Deep within this complex is a tranquil lake with a friendly dinosaur creature called Nessie who will help Mario navigate to a star, as well as the secret green P switch that unlocks green boxes. After obtaining it Mario will be able to use the metal cap to turn into Metal Mario.Lethal Lava LandLethal Lava Land is an ocean of lava with platforms and set pieces jutting up out of it. Mario must leap from platform to platform and avoid falling in the lava. This can be difficult, as many of the enemies try to bump Mario off, and some of the platforms move. In the center is a volcano that conceals a giant inner chamber.Shifting Sand LandShifting Sand Land is a giant desert with a huge pyramid in the center. It has many deadly sand traps and powerful sand whirlwinds which will throw Mario through the air. The pyramid is filled with obstacles, and two giant stone hands with eyes wait in the dark to crush Mario. There is also a giant vulture flying through the sky who is holding onto a star and can steal Mario's hat. When hatless, Mario's defense is reduced and he takes more damage.Dire Dire DocksDire Dire Docks is a water level with a huge whirlpool and a docked submarine. There is also a giant shark that Mario should avoid. Once the second Bowser stage has been completed, the submarine will mysteriously disappear.Bowser In The Fire SeaBowser In The Fire Sea is much like Lethal Lava Lands in that it is a giant lava ocean. The level extends vertically up out of the lava so that a misstep will send Mario falling into a fiery pit. Like the first Bowser level, Bowser In The Fire Sea is linear and it too has a red coins star. At the top is spirally portal that will lead to Mario's second encounter with Bowser, who holds the key for the upstairs. This battle sees Bowser with a few new tricks, but he can be defeated once again by throwing him into the bombs lining the battlefield.Snowman's LandSnowman's Land is a snow level with a huge snowman in the center. Mario can scale the snowman but should watch that he isn't blown off by the snowman's powerful breath. Mario will lose his hat if he is. The lake is frigid and will slowly damage Mario, but a skilled player can jump on the flower hatted snowmen to fly over it.Wet-Dry WorldWet-Dry world is a very vertical level. Mario can scale the cliffs and floating platforms to adjust the water level using switches. The water level present at the stage's start is dependent on whether Mario makes a high or low jump through the painting to enter the stage. There is a hidden town with a bell tower though an underwater tunnel.Tall, Tall MountainTall, Tall Mountain is all about scaling a large mountain surrounded by an abyss. There are many places where if Mario falls he will be taken back to the bottom or lose a life. There is a mischievous monkey that can steal Mario's hat and a sliding challenge much like the earlier snow lodge sledding course. Some of the most difficult tasks have Mario jumping across huge toadstools growing from the abyss around the mountain.Tiny-Huge IslandThis appropriately named level has features that allow Mario to transition between tiny and huge sizes. Depending on Mario's size, the player can affect the environment in different ways. The level has a grassy mountain in the center which can be difficult to scale. The wind is dangerous in this level and can cause Mario to fall to his doom. A giant Wiggler, an easy-to-anger centipede-like creature with boots, lives at the top of the mountain.Tick Tock ClockTick Tock Clock is a level consisting of the inside of a clock. The level requires Mario to ascend a hexagonal structure dodging swinging pendulums and riding conveyor belts and clock hands. Depending on what time it is on the clock when Mario enters the level, the level's obstacles change speed. Certain speeds will make certain stars easier to obtain.Rainbow RideRainbow Ride takes place high up in the sky and has Mario flying on magic carpets and swaying air ships. There is a giant mansion in the sky complete with a fire place and table. This course is very difficult as a single misstep will send Mario to his death.Bowser In The SkyBowser In The Sky is linear like its predecessors and also has a red coins star. It is the longest and arguably hardest of the Bowser levels and at the top is a pipe that leads Mario to his final confrontation with the Koopa King. To defeat Bowser this time Mario must launch him into three bombs instead of just one. After Bowser is hit two times the land next to the bombs falls away leaving the arena in the shape of a star. This makes the last throw to kill Bowser more difficult as it must be done from farther away. When Bowser is destroyed, Mario is awarded with a giant star and Princess Peach is rescued.[CR]Items[CR]Super Mario 64 excludes many of the franchise's classic items, such as the super mushroom and fire flower, in favor of special hats that give Mario unique abilities for a limited time. These caps include the metal cap that make him invulnerable and able to walk on the ocean floor, the vanish cap that allows him to pass through certain barriers, and the wing cap that lets him fly.[CR]However, some classic Mario items do make a return. These include the 1-up mushroom, Koopa shell, and collectible coins, though the functions of coins and shells are different compared to previous Super Mario games. In Super Mario 64, Koopa shells are rare and can be used to surf across the ground and destroy enemies, while collecting coins can restore Mario's health gauge. There are also three types of coins, yellow, blue, and red, worth one, two, and five health points respectively. Additionally, each world contains eight red coins, and collecting all eight during one visit earns Mario a power star.[CR]Development[CR]Super Mario 64 CG artwork[CR]Shigeru Miyamoto began work on a 3D iteration of the Mario franchise after working on Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. For a time he considered developing it for the Super Nintendo, but later decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the limitations of the SNES's hardware. The team spent many of the first months developing the camera and how the gameplay would work.[CR]Originally the game levels were to be linear, but it was later decided that they should be open, free-roaming environments. However, the concept of linear levels can still be seen in final game in the Bowser levels, which require Mario to traverse a set path of obstacles to reach Bowser's lair. The development team prioritized making Mario's movements feel fluid and natural.[CR]Before any levels were created, they tested his movements in a simple grid level which featured a golden bunny named "MIPS". This character later made an appearance in the final game. When the levels were finally designed, they incorporated more puzzles than was typically associated with Mario games. This is probably because The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was in development at the same time but was not released until years later. Some of its puzzle ideas were likely incorporated into Mario 64.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Super Mario 64 was composed by renowned Nintendo composer Koji Kondo. It was first published by Pony Canyon in Japan on July 19, 1996. It was later published in North America by Nintendo on November 1st, 1996.Super Mario 64 Original SoundtrackIt's a me, Mario!Title ThemePeach's MessageOpeningSuper Mario 64 Main ThemeSliderInside the Castle WallsLooping StepsDire, Dire DocksLethal Lava LandSnow MountainHaunted HouseMerry-Go-RoundCave DungeonPirahna Plant's LullabyPowerful MarioMetallic MarioFile SelectCorrect SolutionToad's MessagePower StarRace FanfareStar Catch FanfareGame StartCourse ClearGame OverStage BossKoopa's MessageKoopa's RoadKoopa's ThemeKoopa ClearUltimate KoopaUltimate Koopa ClearEnding DemoStaff RollPirahna Plant's Lullaby-Piano[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Super Mario 64 is one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful video games of all time. It was the top selling Nintendo 64 game and is the second highest selling Wii Virtual Console game. As of the end of 2007, it has sold 11.8 million copies world wide. The game is often praised as having revolutionized the 3D platformer and for pioneering many of the key gameplay concepts used in modern platforming games.[CR]DS Remake[CR]A remake of Super Mario 64 entitled Super Mario 64 DS was released for the original DS handheld on November 20, 2004. The game is faithful to the original version and contains all of the original levels. Additions made to the game include a variety of new minigames, as well as the ability to play the game as Luigi, Yoshi, or Wario.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Yoshi on the Castle roof topThe fastest recorded completion time for Super Mario 64 is 6 minutes and 41 seconds. This run makes use of various glitches in the game that make the game beatable with zero stars.Collecting all 120 stars in the game grants access to the castle roof, where players can meet Yoshi, who gives Mario 99 lives and a flashy new triple jump, along with a friendly message. Bowser's final message to Mario upon his defeat also changes if Mario has collected all 120 stars.Super Mario 64 marks the first time that Peach is referred to by her original Japanese name in the Super Mario series and the last in which she is referred to by her original western localized name, Princess Toadstool. The very first game to see a western release using Peach's original name was the Super NES game Yoshi's Safari.Not counting Yoshi's Island, this is one of the few times that Shy Guy enemies appear in a mainline Mario game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] A Bob-omb Magic Trick[CR]Go to Shifting Land Land and do the "Another place for a second hat" trick. Now go back to the start and pick up a Bob-omb. He'll magically disappear, and you are holding your hat! The smoke sounds wil still be there, but Mario will be holding his red cap like a Bob-omb. Don't press B and wait. Woah! The ticking sound stopped, and no explosion happened. Where did the bomb go? Now, go to one of those tornados in the quick sand and keep on going into it until---the Bob-omb comes out of you and explodes! Cogratulations! Mario has done his first magic trick!  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bob-omb Battlefield Warp 1[CR]There is a warp in Bob-omb Battlefield that lets you get from one side of the level to another quickly. After going up the first slanted bridge, go right and stand in the flower bed. The game will warp you to another flower bed, near the mountain. You can also warp from the flower bed next to the mountain to the flower bed next to the slanted bridge.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Ice Slide in Cool, Cool Mountain[CR]When doing the ice slide if you stay on the slide and follow the coins (a certain patch of coins won't follow the slide and will instead point to a wall) you will go into a secret tunnel hidden in the wall where you can get 2 one-up mushrooms and get to the finish line quicker.</plot>

		<title_clean>Super Smash Bros.</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's title screen.[CR]Super Smash Bros. (known in Japan as "Nintendo All Star! Dairant&#333; Smash Brothers", translated to "Nintendo All-Star! Great Melee Smash Brothers") is a 2.5D fighting game developed by HAL and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 in April 26, 1999.[CR]The game features characters from popular Nintendo franchises (such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pok&#233;mon) in arena battles (for up to four players) using a unique open-movement fighting game system (in which depleting player vitality is replaced by knocking players out of the arena, weakening their knock-back resistance by attacking them).[CR]The game received sequels for each Nintendo console: Super Smash Bros. Melee for the GameCube, Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii, and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The game's concept and gameplay format was later adopted by other game franchise crossovers, such as Jump Super Stars (using Shonen Jump assets) and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale (using Sony assets).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game introduced the fighting system that would later become stable for the entire series, with newer variants increasing the speed and versatility of combat rather than adjusting the underlying gameplay.Physics-Oriented Health System[CR]Rather than ensuing the usual method and dynamics of fighting games, Super Smash Bros. involves a player trying to knock theLink vs. Link[CR]other players off a stage. Each stage has boundaries, which vary from one another in length and height, that allow players to eliminate others by sending them off the stage in one of 4 different directions in most cases. In order to increase the likelihood of a player sending another off the stage, that player can perform a variety of attacks on the other which will inflict damage as represented by a percentile level at the bottom of the screen. As the percentage goes up, each attack you perform will send the opponent further than before, thus making it easier to knock them off the stage. The attacking moves available differ from character to character, much like other fighting games, as each character will have their own unique move set. However, unlike most other fighting games, there are no combos involved and most of the moves are easy to pull off. In addition to the standard attacking moves, each character will also have their own distinctive grappling move which will throw your opponent far distances if their damage percentage is relatively high, as well as the name-sake "smash" attack which can be done by tapping the joystick while preforming a move.Freedom of Motion[CR]To complement the combat objective of knocking opponents off the stage to win, Super Smash Bros. maps have a significant degree of verticality built into their layouts (the notable exception being Final Destination, a flat and uneventful battlefield popular on tournament scene for its lack of environmental hazards). Platforms can be located above and below the main ground, they can move around, and they can potentially injure the player. These extra obstacles and paths lend themselves to a combination of ground and aerial combat, both of which the game encourages. The game also gives each player 2 jumps--a ground jump and a mid-air jump--in addition to a final up B recovery move for most characters to increase the viability of air combat as well as improve the chance of off screen recovery by characters not knocked far enough away from the stage to fall to their death.Ground vs. Air CombatGo! Fight! Win![CR]Air attacks tend to be faster and have less knock back than ground attacks, making the earlier game about racking up damage quickly with lighter, faster aerial strikes. Once the opponent is sufficiently damaged, the smash attacks available to characters on the ground will serve as a final blow to send their targets flying off the side of the stage. Combatants on the ground also get the ability to grab opponents and either punch them while they are helpless or throw them in the hopes of flinging far enough to finish them off. Like all other moves, the throws vary in animation and strength by character and certain throws are more powerful than others depending entirely on which character is used.Mid-Battle Items[CR]Assisting a player during battles are items that were primarily made famous by previous Nintendo titles. During a battle, items will randomly be placed in various locations inside the stage, with each item being different than another in terms of its effects which range from healing health to helping inflict damage and, at times, even deliver a knock-out blow to an opponent. Items can be delivered in numerous forms, as they can either appear by itself, within a capsule, or within a box or a barrel, with boxes and barrels carrying multiple items the majority of the time when opened. However, capsules, boxes, and barrels are best to be thrown at an opponent or on the ground first to open them as some of them self-destruct upon contact.[CR]Modes of Play[CR]Super Smash Bros. consists of two game play modes, a one player progressional mode with a number of stages a player must complete, and a multi-player mode which supports up to 4 players either fighting individually or as teams.1P ModeStage 2 in 1P Mode[CR]1P Mode features 14 stages (3 of which are mini-games, and the last one being a boss battle), with each stage ultimately getting harder as you near the final stage. A player will have the ability to choose the difficulty of the opponents from one of five settings, set how many lives the selected character will have, and indicate whether or not the stages should be timed. As each stage is completed, the character will receive a score which is calculated by how much time is remaining and how much damage the opponent inflicted, and additionally any bonuses the character may have achieved during the stage, such as throwing the opponent off the stage or performing a taunt at the very last moment before the stage is over.VS Mode[CR]Versus Mode is where the multi-player component of the game is kept. This mode supports between two and four players battling, either individually or as teams, on either a stage selected by a player or a random stage. There are two different mAn engaging battle at Hyrule Castle[CR]ethods to choose from in regards to how to determine a winner, having a timed battle or a battle with a fixed set of lives. Timed battles count down from a set time and whoever has the greater kill-to-death ratio (how many players you've knocked off the stage vs. how many times you have been sent off the stage) wins. Stock battles are not timed as every player enters a battle with an equal set of lives, and the last person standing wins (each time a player gets knocked off the stage, they lose a live).Bonus Modes[CR]The Bonus Modes within the game are more intended to act as mini-games and are categorized into 2 games, Break the Targets and Board the Platforms. The Break the Targets mini-game involves a character to maneuver around a stage and hitting 10 targets without falling out of the stage in order to complete the mini-game. The Board the Platforms mini-game is fairly similar, characters must maneuver around a stage and land on 10 platforms without falling out of the stage. Each of the characters within the game have their own unique stage for both of the mini-games, and each of them are timed. If a player doesn't complete the stage, the highest number of targets or platforms a player successfully makes will appear at the character selection screen, but if they complete it, the quickest time it took to complete it will be shown instead.Training Mode[CR]Training Mode is available to those primarily who are new to the game or to some players who want to experiment or refine their play with a character. Training Mode has a large set of options available to a player during play, including changing the game speed, spawning any item, and setting the playing style of the optional computer player.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The character selection screen.  [CR]Super Smash Bros. features a total of 12 playable characters, 4 of which must be unlocked. Among the roster is a series of what, at the time, would be quite a surprise, for example, Ness was one of the unlockable characters, even if he was almost completely unknown in the West and his games were not yet prominent among the other Nintendo franchises. Many other characters, however, are some of the most famous faces in gaming. Biographies of each character are available where each character was described in a couple of paragraphs, and at the end of the game, characters were represented by inactive dolls, falling to the floor of a child's bedroom. The doll archetype would later transform into the Trophy scheme, the main collectible objective of the following games in the series.MarioMARIO!Symbol: Super MushroomHome Stage: Peach's CastleCharacteristics: Great jumping ability, slow ground movement, excellent backthrowB Special Move: Red Fireball.

There are a total of 9 stages and a random stage selector, with each of the stages being unique in their own way as most of the characters playable within the game have a stage that characteristically and historically relates to them. Much like characters,not all stages are available immediately, as one of the stages must be unlocked.Peach's CastlePeach's CastleStage Size: SmallHazards: A bumper floats above a platform that can inflict damageCharacteristics: Small island with shifting block at the bottom of the islandCongo JungleCongo JungleStage Size: Very SmallHazards: A moving and rotating barrel at the bottom of the stage can send a player off the stage if they aren't carefulCharacteristics: Small stage with small revolving platforms in the centerHyrule CastleHyrule CastleStage Size: LargeHazards: A tornado that spawns in random locations on the mapCharacteristics: Large stage with lots of different platformsPlanet ZebesPlanet ZebesStage Size: AverageHazards: Acid beneath the stage that will rise to various heightsCharacteristics: Average sized stage with elevator and rising acidYoshi's IslandYoshi's IslandStage Size: LargeHazards: Clouds to the sides of the stage dissolve if a player stands on them too longCharacteristics: Large stage with relatively small island and clouds in distanceDreamlandDreamlandStage Size: Very SmallHazards: Whispy Woods will try to blow you off the platformCharacteristics: Very small stage with very few obstacles or hazardsSector ZSector ZStage Size: Very LargeHazards: Arwings will come in at random and shoot if a player is in their sightsCharacteristics: Very large stage with two different battle areas of different heightsSaffron CitySaffron CityStage Size: AverageHazards: Pokemon that may inflict damage will appear at random outside an area within the stageCharacteristics: Average sized stage with one main battle area and two small landing areasMushroom KingdomStage must be unlocked (beat 1P Mode on Normal with lives set to 3 with all eight original characters)Stage Size: LargeHazards: Piranha Plants that randomly appear out of pipes can inflict damage, POW block can send a player off the stage if they are on the ground when struckCharacteristics: Large stage, only stage to be predominatly flat, contain pipes that can warp a player to another location on the stage[CR]Items[CR]BarrelItem Type: ContainerCharacteristics: Can contain up to 3 items, can also self-destruct after thrown or hitBeam SwordItem Type: Close CombatCharacteristics: Powerful swordBob-ombItem Type: ThrowCharacteristics: Explodes after thrown or hit, if left unattended it will start movingBumperItem Type: ThrowCharacteristics: Lays on the ground when thrown, if hit by a player they will have damage inflicted and the bumper will moveCapsuleItem Type: ContainerCharacteristics: Contains an item, can also self-destruct after thrown or hitChansey EggItem Type: ContainerCharacteristics: Contains an item, can also self-destruct after thrown or hitCrateItem Type: ContainerCharacteristics: Contains up to 3 items, can also self-destruct after thrown or hitFanItem Type: Close CombatCharacteristics: Weak though quick weapon, more useful if thrown at opponentFire FlowerItem Type: CombatCharacteristics: Unleashes a fiery blast, wears out over timeGreen ShellItem Type: ThrowCharacteristics: Powerful if hits an opponent in mid-air, will roll across the stage aswellHammerItem Type: Close CombatCharacteristics: Very powerful weapon, players will be unable to double or triple jump if carrying this weaponHeartItem Type: RecoveryCharacteristics: Will recover all of your healthHome Run BatItem Type: Close CombatCharacteristics: If a smash attack is used with this, it can instantly send an opponent off the stageMaxim TomatoItem Type: RecoveryCharacteristics: Will recover 100% of your health if a player had over 100% damageMotion Sensor BombItem Type: ThrowCharacteristics: Powerful, will detonate when any character touches itPokeballItem Type: ThrowCharacteristics: Will unleash a random Pokemon, with each Pokemon having a different attack or effectRay GunItem Type: CombatCharacteristics: Will send a laser shot that is useful for long range combat, will wear out over timeRed ShellItem Type: ThrowCharacteristics: Powerful if hits an opponent in mid-air, will move toward nearest player aswell if thrown onto stage, will disappear over timeStarItem Type: SpecialCharacteristics: Will temporarily give a player invincibilityStar RodItem Type: Combat/Close CombatCharacteristics: Can be used for close combat and if used as a smash attack, semi-long range[CR]Pok&#233;balls[CR]There are 13 different Pokemon that may randomly appear out when a Pokeball is thrown in Super Smash Bros.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Superman (often referred to unofficially as Superman 64) is a game based on Superman: The Animated Series. It was released on May 31, 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and was developed and published by Titus Interactive. The game is notorious for its overwhelmingly negative reception from critics.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens with Lex Luthor kidnapping Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Dr. Emil Hamilton. They're placed into a virtual recreation of Metropolis, so Superman must enter this world to rescue them. At the beginning of the game Luthor states, "If you want to save your friends, solve my maze!" The "maze", however, consists of hoops scattered about the virtual world that Superman must fly through before time runs out. If the player strays too far from the hoops, time will be deducted and the player will fail the level.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Superman's powers and speed have been greatly diminished from the canon of the show, which the developers explain as "kryptonite fog" (actually the fog hiding the draw distance colored green) limiting his powers. The player must fly through several sets of the aforementioned rings to reach an objective such as defeating a set number of thugs or picking up cars. Failure to complete the ring courses under the time limit will force the player to start over. If successful, the player can enter the action segments consisting of one-button combat. Superman's powers such as ice breath or heat vision can be used, but they must be acquired as pick-ups and can only be used for a few seconds.MultiplayerRings are a common obstacle.The game also contains multiplayer; a deathmatch mode and a race mode. In deathmatch, the players play as various Superman characters as they pilot ships such as the ship that delivered Superman to Earth. Players fly around in an attempt to shoot each other down in a mode similar to Star Fox 64's multiplayer. Various power-ups are scattered around the map that players can use to take down other players such as lock on missiles, as well as shields that offer invincibility.As for the race mode, one player places rings around a track and the other players must go through them to be victorious. This mode however can also be won by shooting down every other player, turning it into a deathmatch, and rendering it pointless. The multiplayer can be played with up to four players.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Superman was universally panned by critics. Common complaints included the overly sensitive flying controls, the poor graphics and animations, the poor use of superpowers, and the repetitive nature of the game. One common complaint was the thick kryptonite fog. The prevalence of thick fog is not uncommon in Nintendo 64 titles due to the hardware's draw distance limitations, but on top of all of the game's other technical and design issues, it seemed absurd for Titus to attempt to explain away the fog as a power-inhibiting haze inside of a virtual world.The game went on to collect "worst game of the year" awards for 1999 from multiple publications and has gone on to garner a reputation as one of the worst games ever made. In 2008, it was made the subject of an episode of the internet game retrospective series The Angry Video Game Nerd. The show's host, James Rolfe, reviewed the game due to popular demand. In the episode, he brought specific attention to the game's poor collision detection, character animation, and lack of checkpoints. He capped the episode off in a sequence that depicts him as flying off into outer space like Superman and flinging the game into the sun.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get ice-throwing breath[CR]To be able to ice things up with a burst of Superman's wintry-fresh freeze breath, just pause the game and tap Z then L.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Disney's Tarzan is a game based on the 1999 film of the same name. There were two kinds of collectibles spread throughout the levels; one was letters, which when put together spelledOne Of The Bonus Levels[CR]T-A-R-Z-A-N, aswell as 4 pieces of a "jigsaw" (of sorts), which when put together revealed a mosaic of a monkey's face. If the player found all the letters, they would be granted to a bonus level of some sort. These varied from either a young Tarzan floating down a river, to an older Tarzan riding an Ostrich. In these levels the player has 30 seconds to get as many coins as possible before time runs out, aswell as an unspecified red fruit that, when caught, extends the time available by 5 seconds. Whereas if the player catches all four pieces of the mosaic they would be treated to a movie clip, pulled directly from the animated Disney movie. These are mainly used to extend the plot, beyond the regular cutscenes inbetween levels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is largely 2D basic platforming, although with one or two 3D mini-games thrown in. One that is prominently used is the view switching behind Tarzan as he slides down a massive tree branch. The player must duck, jump and lean right or left in order to avoid objects and therefore get all the coins. There are two levels in the game where theplayer will be controlling a character other than Tarzan. In the level Baboon Chase the player takes control of Jane; an English lady who serves as Tarzan's love interest throughout the game. Aswell as in the level Trashing The Camp the player takes control of Turk; a baboon who serves as Tarzan's best friend during his childhood.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The plot of the game closely resembles the plot of the film largely because the only remnants of a story are put forward by movie clips directly pulled from the 1999 animated motion picture. The player goes through 4 levels as young Tarzan, before going through a montage of Tarzan getting progressively older. From this point on the player controls "Old" Tarzan (like Old Snake, but not). There is a sub-boss halfway through the game, where Tarzan defeats the Cheetah, in a similiar situation to how the events occur in the movie. The last level culminates in a showdown with Clayton, the main antagonist in the game. Similiar to many games of the time period, the final boss battle is reliant on Pattern Recognition, and must be taken advantage of in order to defeat Clayton.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Tetris 64 (????64?) is a puzzle game for the Nintendo 64. It was released only in Japan in 1998. The whole game is in English. It is the only Nintendo 64 game that can make use of the Nintendo 64's bio sensor which was included with the game.[CR]Tetris 64 offers a few variations on the original Tetris,[CR]    * Tetris - The standard tetris game not differing from the original.[CR]    * Giga Tetris - The normal tetris game, but with oversized tetrominoes which break up into smaller pieces.[CR]    * Bio Tetris - The normal tetris game using the bio sensor. The game is sped up or slowed down depending on the user's heart rate.[CR]Bio Sensor[CR]The bio sensor is a Nintendo 64 accessory produced by SETA and only available in Japan. It was sold on its own or packaged with Tetris 64. The bio sensor looks like a Nintendo 64 controller pak with a wire coming out of it with a clip on the end. One end of the sensor plugs into the extension port on the Nintendo 64 controller, and the other end clips onto the player's ear. The device measures the user's heart rate.[CR]Critical reception[CR]The game was praised for its multiplayer mode, which at the time was the only Nintendo 64 Tetris game which allowed 4 player mode, while most puzzle games still had not made the step into the four-player arena,[CR]    * "Tetris 64 manages to do so and delivers the best possible multiplayer gameplay." (IGN)[CR]The game was also recommended for import to English speaking territories because all in-game text is in English. The game was criticized however for its poor graphics and simple backgrounds which could not compare to other Tetris games out on the system at the same time, such as Magical Tetris Challenge or[CR][CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_64[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Time Trial[CR]Released in August of 1997, Tetrisphere has the distinction of being the first puzzle game released for the N64. As the name suggests, is all about a spherical object and the tetronminoes that are joined to its core. The basic idea of the game is to remove pieces by dropping more pieces of the same shape and color onto those pieces in order to dive deeper into the core of the sphere and complete the goal. Through skillful play the player can receive power-ups that remove more pieces and will increase is power if not used. The player is usually fighting against the clock which is usually representd by the titular sphere slowly inching towards the screen. If the sphere hits the screen the player is penalized with a skull. In most modes three skulls will result in failure. In order to prevent the sphere from hitting the screen the player needs to remove pieces from the sphere which will cause it to "bounce back" combos give the players more time as it causes the sphere to bounce back further. The game actually started life as an unreleased Jaguar title called Phere, Nintendo however picked up the game and added the Tetris license.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Tetrisphere Menu[CR]Rescue: Rescue is all about the basic principles of Tetrisphere; remove pieces from the core by dropping more pieces onto the sphere. In this mode, the player is fighting against the clock and will receive power-ups if the combo multiplier is high enough. In order to complete a level, the player must remove enough pieces from the sphere so that the creature trapped inside can escape. The player will fail the level if the player accumulates 3 skulls.[CR]Hide Seek: Essentially Rescue but with certain conditions that must either be met.[CR]Puzzle: Puzzle has no time limit and is significantly different to the other modes in that the objective is to clear the core entirely but with limited moves/slides or drops. The levels in Puzzle get progressively harder.[CR]Time Trial: Time Trial is a race against time to get the highest score possible within the given time.[CR]Vs Cpu: In Vs Cpu you face off against the CPU's robots in a race to release the trapped creature first. The game plays in split screen while in this mode and by making combos black debris tetrominoes will be deposited onto the opposing player's sphere.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Tetrisphere Multi-Player[CR]The game does support multi-player in the form of VS mode. VS mode enables you to play against a computer or friend.[CR]Magic/Items[CR]In order to earn magic, you must create combos by using power pieces (Tetrominoes). Getting a combo of eliminating 20 pieces or more should do the trick. Magic enables you to remove a large amount of pieces from the sphere all at once. Once you collect enough magic, you will get items that will appear near the timer. Here are the items that you can earn if you gather up enough magic.[CR]Firecracker: Eliminates a small section of pieces on the sphere.[CR]Bundle O' Dynamite: Gets rid of pieces that are in a spread.[CR]Electro Magnet: Pulls pieces away from the sphere like a magnet.[CR]Atom: Literally peels the top layer of the sphere like an orange.[CR]Bomb: Eliminates a great amount of pieces.[CR]Ray Gun: Cuts though and removes pieces though the core.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select (from secret characters)[CR]Go to the ''New Name'' screen and press L, Right-C, Down-C to bring up secret characters for use on the Password Screen. Use the A button to select the letters. Type the following code: [CR]Saturn, Spaceship, Rocket, Heart, Skull</plot>

		<title_clean>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six in a 1998 video game based on the novel bearing the same name by author Tom Clancy. The video game shares many themes with the novel, including a heavy emphasis on terrorism and anti-terrorism, covert operations, and international politics. Rainbow Six has been ported to many consoles following its original PC release. Depending on the console, Rainbow Six is played in either a first-person or third-person perspective, allowing players to take the role of a covert anti-terrorist heading into action and giving commands to teammates in order to tactically defeat the enemy. The PC version was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment, except in Europe where it was published by Ubisoft.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Team Rainbow is an elite international group of anti-terrorist experts, covertly sent on missions around the world in an attempt to smother out the flames of rising terrorism. The team is often assigned hostage rescue missions from director John Clark, during the course of which Rainbow is alerted to the actions of a radial terrorist organization the Phoenix Group. [CR]During several mission infiltrating the many bases of operation for the Phoenix Group, team Rainbow successfully gathers intelligence from the Phoenix Group&#8217;s biological research facility. It is revealed that the terrorist organization is planning to unleash a biological weapon at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. [CR]Team Rainbow immediately prepares to infiltrate the large underground network of the Olympic Village, seeking the location of the weapon, and thwarting the Phoenix Group&#8217;s plans. The Rainbow Team concludes it&#8217;s mission against the Phoenix Group by entering the group&#8217;s main facilities, resembling an ecosphere for botanical and viral research. Team Rainbow successfully incapacitates the enemy leader, taking out a major threat to world peace.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Rainbow Six forces players to strictly plan each mission, examining every tactical angle before thrown into action. Levels are prefaced with briefings that provide the player with a map of the area, suspected locations of terrorists and hostages, and entry and exit points. The player is encouraged to plot their own waypoints on the map, while choosing different alert status for the team (i.e, &#8220;escort&#8221; or &#8220;engage&#8221;). However, stock execution plans are available in the player chooses to bypass the planning stage. [CR]Four teams are at disposal to the player, one of which is in direct control through either first person or third person view. Sixteen individual members comprise Rainbow Six, each of which can be either promoted or assigned to different color coded teams, such as Gold, Red, Blue and Green. [CR]Once the mission has begun, players have access to the wide range of weapons chose during planning. For example, flashbangs temporarily debilitate enemies, which is the player&#8217;s advantage when approaching guarded hostages. The player also has the ability to advance other teams in the field, either by switching the control and view to a different colored team, or executing Go-Codes such as &#8220;Advance&#8221; or &#8220;Hold Position.&#8221; [CR]When a team member of Rainbow is incapacitated by the enemy, vital signs display the status of the downed member. If a member has been killed, he or she will be unavailable for the roster for the remainder of the game. Incapacitated members must wait to recover at least one following mission before returning to action.  [CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Rainbow Six is notable for it&#8217;s online multiplayer during a time when internet gaming was in its early stages. Many maps were multiplayer specific for the PC, such as City Street Large, a training level.  [CR]Multiplayer on the console was limited to split screen co-op gameplay. Each player controlled one of the colored Rainbow teams, coordinating infiltration of dangerous areas and evacuation of multiple hostages.   [CR]Different Versions[CR]The Nintendo 64 version made use of nearly every button on the controller, forcing players to constantly switch between the middle and left handle. Aiming was controlled with the analog stick, for example, while reloading was designated to the left shoulder button. The Nintendo 64 version received both criticism and praise for this control scheme, as critics cited the layout&#8217;s awkwardness, while the positive reviews noted a parallel to real world actions. It was developed by Saffire. The Dreamcast version was developed by Pipe Dream Interactive and published by Majesco. The Game Boy Color version was developed by Crawfish Interactive and published by South Peak.    [CR]PC Requirements[CR] Windows 95/98; Pentium 166 (Min.), Pentiom 200 (Rec.); 4x CD-ROM drive (Min.); 16Mb RAm (Min.), 32 MB (Rec.); 16-bit SVGA or better (2D video); Direct 3D compatible hardware acceleration reccomended; Soundblaster 16 compatible; 100MB free hard drive space; Mouse &amp; Keyboard.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Tony Hawk, pulling off a sick kickflip 50 feet in the air.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (known in most European regions as Tony Hawk's Skateboarding) is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the PlayStation on September 30, 1999. The first game in the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brings real skateboarders (such as Tony Hawk and Bob Burnquist), signature skateboarding brands (including real skateboard decals), and easier accessibility into the scarcely-populated skateboarding video game genre.[CR]The game was ported to the Nintendo 64 on February 29, 2000 (ported by Edge of Reality and published by Activision), the Dreamcast on June 29, 2000 (ported by Treyarch and published by Crave), and the N-Gage on October 23, 2003 (ported by Ideaworks and published by Nokia). The Nintendo 64 version is known for its censorship of both blood and vulgar song lyrics (granting it an "E" rating by the ESRB, as opposed to the original "T" rating). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is included in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x for the Xbox and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).[CR]A separate game was released on the Game Boy Color on March 2000 (developed by Natsume and published by Activision) featuring elements from the console versions but focused on skating on a half pipe in a side angle (Half Pipe Mode) and racing opponents in an overhead angle (1on1 Vs. CPU Mode).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, players control their skater as they participate in two-minute runs (one-minute for special "competition" runs) where they complete specific goals in that time (such as earning a large score count by performing tricks and collecting symbols scattered around the level).ControlsGetting huge air off a ramp while performing a Grab Trick.[CR]Players steer their skater with the D-Pad and jump by pressing the Jump button. Holding down the Jump button while on the ground causes the skater to crouch down, increasing their speed. While in the air, they can hold down a direction on the D-Pad and either press the Flip button to perform a Flip Trick (simple tricks that can be easily chained with other tricks) or hold down the Grab button to perform a Grab Trick (tricks that can be held constantly for more points).[CR]Holding down a different direction on the D-Pad performs a different Flip or Grab Trick, which changes the point value of the trick (inversely proportional to the time required to execute the trick). Some advanced Flip Tricks can be held like Grab Tricks. If the player attempts to hit (or land on) a surface while a trick is in effect, the skater bails.[CR]Also, while in the air, they can spin around by holding left on the D-Pad, right on the D-Pad, or either shoulder button, increasing the point value (for every 180-degree spins) of the trick in effect (also adding points for simple jumps). However, landing with the skateboard in the wrong position causes the skater to bail.[CR]While in the air and close to a grindable edge (such as rails), they can press the Grind button to perform a Grind Trick (which lets them travel along the edge, earning points along the way). If they are close to a wall, they can press the Grind button to Wall Ride off the wall (earning points while increasing the skater's height). In both cases, they can press the Jump button to perform another jump. Pressing Up on the D-Pad and pressing the Grind button approaching straight on a halfpipe lip performs a Handplant.[CR]After a trick is successfully executed, they can perform another trick, adding onto the current combo chain (adding to the overall point value of the chain while increasing the chain's score multiplier). The score derived from the chain is added to the overall score counter if the skater lands successfully on the ground. The score is lost completely if the skater bails at any time. Extra points can be added to the chain by collecting special pickups, and hitting Gaps (hidden locational points reached by performing a specific jump, grinding specific edges, and interacting with specific objects).[CR]As the player lands more chains, their Special meter increases. Once the meter reaches its maximum capacity, the bar flashes yellow, allowing players to perform special Signature Moves (flashy Grab, Flip, and Grind Tricks that give a lot of points when successfully executed). When the bar is flashing yellow, it slowly depletes (and stops flashing yellow when the meter fully depletes). The meter fully depletes at any time when the skater bails.[CR]Holding Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Nollie, and double-tapping Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Fastplant, each adding points during the jump. Players can also perform a Nollie by pressing either shoulder button on the ground (switching their stance) and pressing the Jump button.Game Modes and Objectives[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater includes three single-player game modes (Career, Single Session, and Free Skate) and three multiplayer game modes for up to two players locally (Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE). Levels, skaters, and boards can only be unlocked by playing through Career Mode (or by cheat codes).[CR]Career Mode is the single-player campaign, as players lead one of the ten standard skaters (and two unlockable skaters) through all nine levels, unlocking new levels, skaters, and boards by collecting videotapes and winning competitions. Each standard level has five videotapes to collect, each by completing a specific objective in one run:Achieving the level's High Score.Colliding or grinding with five level-specific objects.Finding and collecting five letters (S-K-A-T-E) scattered throughout the level.Finding a videotape pickup somewhere hidden in the level.Achieving the level's Sick Score (which is larger than the High Score).[CR]Three levels "competition" levels, in which players are ranked (by score) in three one-minute runs. The best two runs are averaged out and compared against the competition, and the player wins by placing in the top three.[CR]Along with Career Mode, players can play Single Session, which are simple two-minute runs with the only objective of obtaining the highest score of each level, and Free Skate, which allow players to freely roam each level with no time limit or objectives.[CR]Two players can play competitively in three multiplayer modes: Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE. Grafitti and Trick Attack are split-screen simultaneous multiplayer, while HORSE is single-screen alternating multiplayer. In Grafitti, both players race against the clock to "paint" the level by performing tricks on objects. The player with the most objects painted wins. In Trick Attack, both players race the clock to achieve the highest score. The player with the highest score wins. In HORSE, players alternate ten-second turns to land a higher scoring chain than the previous one. If a player fails to land a higher score, then he/she gets a letter penalty and the required score resets. If the player gets the maximum letter penalty (making up a word, such as H-O-R-S-E), then the other player wins the game. (If the player fails to land a chain and the previous score is zero, then he/she does not get a penalty) A custom word can be chosen at the beginning of the game.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game includes nine fictional levels (located in the United States) to skate on, each level consisting of either skate parks or other urban environments.WarehouseWarehouse[CR](Woodland Hills, CA)[CR]Career High Score: 5,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 15,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Collide with five sets of boxes.SchoolSchool[CR](Miami, FL)[CR]Career High Score: 7,500 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 15,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Grind five lunch tables.MallMall[CR](New York City, NY)[CR]Career High Score: 10,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 30,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Break five mall directories.Skate ParkSkate Park[CR](Chicago, IL)[CR]Competition Level.DowntownDowntown[CR](Minneapolis, MN)[CR]Career High Score: 15,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 40,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Break five "No Skating" signs.Downhill JamDownhill Jam[CR](Phoenix, AZ)[CR]Career High Score: 20,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 40,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Open five water valves.BurnsideBurnside[CR](Portland, OR)[CR]Competition Level.StreetsStreets[CR](San Francisco, CA)[CR]Career High Score: 25,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 50,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Wreck five cop cars.RoswellRoswell[CR](Roswell, New Mexico)[CR]Competition Level.[CR]Playable Skaters[CR]Tony Hawk[CR]Style: Vert (goofy stance)Tony Hawk[CR]Ollie: &gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Speed: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Air: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Balance: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Signature Moves:360 Flip to Mute (1500 points) - Down, Down + Flip.540 Board Varial (2000 points) - Left, Left + Flip.Kickflip McTwist (4000 points) - Right, Right + Grab.The 900 (8000 points) - Right, Down + Grab.Bob Burnquist[CR]Style: VertBob Burnquist[CR]Ollie: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Speed: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Air: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Balance: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Signature Moves:One-Footed Smith (grind, minimum 750 points) - Right, Right + Grind.Backflip (4000 points) - Up, Down + Grab.Burntwist (5000 points) - Left, Up + Grind.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]New ground moves in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the PlayStation on September 20, 2000. Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the "collecting videotape" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).[CR]The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by LTI Gray Matter), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from "T" to "E"). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).[CR]Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Enhancements[CR]While THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes.Create-a-SkaterCreate-A-Skater editor menu.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create your own skater, allowing you to play through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar of yourself or a custom edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for your character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.An example of a custom gap[CR]The ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign.Park EditorThe Park Editor's toolset[CR]Also a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.[CR]The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.New grind tricks.[CR]Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the "Manuals" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.[CR]A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash Collectables[CR]Cash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Hangar[CR]Location: Mullet Falls, Montana[CR]Hangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar. It features a large roll-in drop, a wooden half-pipe, a secret half-pipe located in a wind-tunnel and an active helicopter that, when the player grinds its chopper blades, takes off, destroys part of the roof and opens a hidden, outdoor area.[CR]This level is featured in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.[CR]ObjectivesObjective NameDescriptionCash RewardHigh ScoreObtain a score of 10,000 points$100Pro ScoreObtain a score of 25,000 points$200Sick ScoreObtain a score of 75,000 points$500Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the SKATE letters$150Barrel HuntRun into 5 scattered barrel stacks$150Collect 5 Pilot WingsCollect 5 floating pilot emblems$250Nosegrind Over the PipeNosegrind over the arching rails on the wooden half-pipe$150Hit 3 Hangtime GapsOllie over 3 special gaps$150Find the Secret TapeCollect the hidden tape$150100% Goals and CashComplete all prior goals and collect all cash icons$200School II[CR]Location: Southern California, California[CR]School II is set in a college campus.

The level is built around a volcano and if the player hops out of the level, an ominous voice (Most likely to symbolize God) either laughs at the player or proclaims "You suck" .

This level was originally in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.Mat Hoffman Bike Headquarters (N64 Only)Tampa Skate Park (Xbox Only)Construction Site (Xbox Only)Sky Lines (Xbox Only)Club (Xbox Only)Subway (Xbox Only)Rooftops (GBA Only)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pro SkatersTony HawkOverturn: Down, Left and GrindThe 900: Right, Down and GrabSacktap: Up, Down and GrabSpecialty: VertAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance7526853365Bob BurnquistRocket Tailslide: Left, Down and GrindRacket Air: Left, Down and GrabOne-Foot Smith: Right, Down and GrindSpecialty: Vert and Switch StanceAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance6555538274Steve CaballeroHang Ten: Right, Up and GrindTriple Kickflip: Up, Left and FlipFS 540: Right, Left and GrabSpecialty: All-aroundAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance6556355654Kareem CampbellNosegrind to Pivot: Down, Up and GrindGhetto Bird: Down, Up and FlipCasper: Left, Down and GrabSpecialty: Street, railsAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance7265845625Rune GlifbergOne-Foot Bluntslide: Left, Up and GrindKickflip One-Foot Tail: Left, Down and FlipChrist Air: Left, Right and GrabSpecialty: VertAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance7756534433Eric KostonThe Fandangle: Right, Down and GrindIndy Frontflip: Down, Up and GrabPizza Guy: Down, Left and GrabSpecialty: Vert and Switch StanceAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance4375447736Bucky LasekThe Big Hitter: Left, Down and GrindOne-Foot Japan: Down, Right and GrabFingerflip Airwalk: Left, Right and GrabSpecialty: VertAirHang TimeOllieSpeedSpinLandingSwitchRail BalanceLip BalanceManual Balance7736735372Rodney MullenHeelflip Darkslide: Left, Right and GrindNollieflip Underflip: Down, Left and FlipCasper to 360 Flip: Down, Right and GrabSpecialty: Street.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Now you can skate with your friends![CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision (under their Activision o2 label) for the PlayStation 2 (on October 28, 2001), GameCube (on November 13, 2001), and Xbox (on March 4, 2002). The third installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new hidden variations of normal tricks and the Revert, a ground trick that can be executed as soon as the player hits the ground from a quarter-pipe, allowing them to continue from a Vert combo chain), and online multiplayer for up to four players (PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions only). The Career Mode currency system from the predecessor is removed (unlocking levels now just require objective completion, while stat increase points and new decks are gained by picking up special pickups scattered throughout levels).[CR]The game was ported to the PlayStation In October 29, 2001 (by Shaba Games), PC in March 28, 2002 (by Gearbox), and Nintendo 64 in August 20, 2002 (by Edge of Reality). The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions run on a slightly-modified Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 engine (still adding gameplay elements like the Revert), changing the level structure of most levels while replacing the secret Cruise Ship level with a new Downhill level. Some of the levels in the original version are believed to be released as downloadable content in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).[CR]Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 15, 2001 (developed by HotGen) and the Game Boy Advance on March 4, 2002 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, featuring many elements from the console versions.[CR]Like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, this game features crossover characters from different franchises as playable skaters. Darth Maul (a Sith apprentice from the Star Wars franchise), Wolverine (a superhero from the X-Men franchise), and Kelly Slater (a surfer from Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer) are included as hidden unlockable skaters. The PC version of the game features Doom from Quake III: Arena (as Doom Guy).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Revert[CR]The revert is a move that allows players to link vert tricks into a new or in-progress combo. It is a flatland trick that is performed immediately when landing off of a vert surface like a quarter-pipe or pool lip. The more times it is used in a single combo, the slower the player's speed will be when exiting the revert. To link vert tricks into a combo, a manual must be performed immediately after the revert animation.Open Environments[CR]Despite Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 featuring large, open-ended levels, THPS3 used it's current generation of systems' power to its advantage and brought the large-scale environments to life. Areas were now filled with NPCs, moving cars that would stop at obstacles, complex animated objects and real-time level shifting. Every level in THPS3 features a large or minor-scale change that can be triggered through the player's actions and either unlocks a previously hidden area or completely changes a part of the level altogether. These could either be part of a level goal or simply a hidden secret for the player to discover.Trick Modifiers[CR]One other major addition to the game was the Trick Modifier system. This is a system that has been with the franchise since, although being refined in THPS4 and perfected in Tony Hawk's Underground. The trick modifier system are "Hidden moves" that can be performed by actions on the face buttons. For example, hitting the button combination for a kickflip while hitting the flip trick button twice will perform a Double Kickflip. Hitting it three times will perform a Triple Kickflip. Though THPS3 refers to them as Hidden Moves (An on-screen pop-up appears with a bonus score being awarded), they have become the standard in the series for performing modified versions of standard tricks.Network Play[CR]A breakthrough addition to the series is the addition of online multiplayer. This would later be refined in later entries of the franchise but the base concept remains the same. The game allows for up to 4 players in one lobby and drops them in a Free Skate session. The host then decides which game type will be played. The various game types can be found below. Players could either play through a Broadband connection or, on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, a dial-up connection.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features a wide variety of game modes thanks to the addition of Network Play. Some new, some returning from past entries.Single-player ModesCareer Mode[CR]The same as it's always been in the series. The player is given a list of goals within a level and a two-minute timer to complete them. The level can be retried multiple times to complete the goals. Completing goals unlocks more levels until the last competition level is beaten. A few changes have been made to the Career Mode in THPS3, however. They are:Cash is no longer required to progress within the career mode. The collectible is entirely gone from the game.Stat points are no longer purchased but are, instead, hidden inside levels as collectibles. There are 5 per level. Collecting one lets you assign one stat point wherever the player wishes to.Decks are no longer purchased but are collected. One "Deck" collectible is hidden in each level and collecting it unlocks one deck for the selected pro skater.Collect S-K-A-T-E is now different depending on the selected pro skater. Street skaters will have their letters on lower, more technical areas of the level while vert skaters will have them on more vert/gap oriented areas. All-around skaters will have a mixture of both.Skater-specific goals. Much like the Collect S-K-A-T-E separation, certain level-based objectives will be dependent on the selected skater's specialty.Single Session[CR]Gives the players a two-minute timer without goals to set high scores.Free Skate[CR]Allows the player to freely roam levels, find gaps and search for secrets.Multiplayer ModesGraffiti[CR]Both players compete in the level against the clock to capture as much territory as possible. Performing a trick on an object will paint it the player's color and painting as much of the level as possible is the objective. Players can re-capture an object by scoring higher than the previous player's object score.Trick Attack[CR]Players compete against each other to score the highest. The player with the highest score when the timer runs out wins.HORSE[CR]Pits players against each other to see who can pull off the best trick sequence. Players have 10 second turns and start at key points within each map. When one player pulls of his trick, the next player must score higher. This keeps going until one of the players screws up, getting the first letter of HORSE (Or a custom word chosen at the beginning of the game).Slap![CR]Slap! requires players to skate around and, quite literally, slap each other the most. Simply running into each other causes players to slap each other, though the fastest one will come out the victor. The other will bail and fall to the floor. The player with the highest amount of slaps at the end of the timer wins.King of the Hill[CR]King of the Hill places a floating crown in the level. When a player collects it, it appears over his head and he must hold onto it the longest. If another player rams into him, he gains control of the crown. The objective is to hold the crown the longest, hitting preset timer scores.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The FoundryLocation: An indoor metal foundry.[CR]The Foundry is a level set in, wait for it, metal foundry. It features multiple stories, catwalks and large jumps and pipes. The level has a large set of metal, ceiling-suspended catwalks, girders, pipes and airborne rails that can be grinded as well as a large cauldron. The cauldron is the level's destructible object. When grinding the top of a nearby control booth, the bucket flips over itself and falls into the cauldron, creating a rail-based jump gap. There are also other heightened ledges and platforms, a large sunken quarter pipe and an electricity turbine that can be entered when complete a Career objective named "Un-jam the 5 Valves".Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 10,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 30,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 50,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Cannonball over the Half-Pipe (Vert Skaters)Perform a Cannonball over the large, sunken half-pipe at the beginning of the level.50-50 TC's Rail (Street Skaters)Perform a 50-50 Grind on one of the rails near the raising platform control station.Soak the ForemanPerform a grind on the control panel of the platform-raised pool.Grind the Molten BucketAs the bucket is dumping molten metal, jump up to the rails on the side and grind them.Un-jam 5 ValvesSimply grind 5 wall-mounted valves.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.CanadaLocation: An outdoor skatepark located in a woody, snow-filled, lakeside park.[CR]Canada is one of the game's larger levels, featuring extremely open areas that form both an outdoor park and skatepark. Part of the level is a parking lot featuring a handful of jumps and rails, a skatepark featuring a set of massive bowls, quarter pipes and half-pipes as well as a amerindian totem pole that totally isn't a stereotype at all. Next to the skatepark is a forested area featuring a wood-build catwalk that circles through trees above a set of quarter pipes and directly next to that area is an above-ground/water platform. The platform is on two levels, the first level being a simple plank board leading up to a quarter pipe. A canadian man peeing in the water stands at the top of the QP. A switch nearby activates access to the upper-level that leads to a wooden tube-like pipe slanted down from a mountain-track mining-cart rail. The rail leads to nowhere. The level's destructive element is quite banal, simply being the ability to knock the head off of the totem pole.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 35,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 70,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 120,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Melon Grab Over the Blade (Vert Skaters)Perform a Melon grab over the roll-in at the start of the level.Nosegrind Around the Horn (Street Skaters)Perform a Nosegrind around the wooden catwalks found in the forested area.Get Chuck UnstuckSimply ram into the poor gentleman who's tongue is stuck onto a pole.Bury That Bully!Jump into the snowy tree behind a bully that is throwing snowballs at kids.Impress The SkatersThere are five skaters located throughout the skatepark. Perform a combo over 2,500 points near them to impress them. Impress all 5 to complete the objective.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.Rio - Competition LevelLocation: A skatepark located in the high mountains of Rio de Janiero.[CR]Rio is the first of three competition levels. Like previous games, a one-minute timer is given to three rounds. The score from the best two out of three rounds is tallied and the skater with the highest score wins the gold. The level itself is set in a high-mountain area of Rio. The O Cristo Redentor statue is visible from the level. The level itself is generally comprised of bowls, quarter-pipes and half-pipes. A series of ledges, wires and rails circle the level that provide, to skilled players, an opportunity to pull-off a near-infinite combo. There's a hidden backyard pool and ledges that can be grinded on nearby houses. The destructible object in the level is a wooden platform that is supported by a ladder. When the ladder is hit by the player, it collapses and turns into two ledges that add to the infinte combo mentioned above.SuburbiaLocation: A suburban neighborhood.[CR]Suburbia is located in a neighborhood cul-de-sac and is split into 4 distinct areas. The first is the Trailer Park. It features a large, wooden half-pipe and sits next to trailer homes. The trailer homes have wooden planks and ramps next to/on them allowing them to be used as jumps and/or platforms. The trailer park area is also surrounded by a wooden quarter-pipe that sticks to the location's fence. The second area is the family homes. There are two. The first is a two-storey house that has a large, empty underground pool and is surrounded by a grindable fence. The second is a large, upper-class home. It has an accessible driveway, a green Jeep Wrangler parked in the driveway and has a backyard entirely covered in quarter-pipes. The third area is an under-construction home. The house also has a pool in it's backyard and is basically a large, wooden skeleton that can be grinded. Here is where you find an axe, needed to access the fourth area: the Haunted House. The haunted house is boarded-up. There is a Career Mode goal where a man will chop down the boards when given an axe. Doing this unlocks the house's backyard that is filled with quarter-pipes. The area instantly turns dark when you enter it and there are a number of zombie hands that burst out of the ground. The player can then jump into the house to find "spooky" hidden secrets.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 55,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 110,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 200,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Nosegrab Between the Ramps (Vert Skaters)Perform a Nosegrab in the air while transferring between two Trailer Park quarter pipes.Heelflip the Trailer Hop (Street Skaters)Perform a Heelflip over one of the trailer homes.Squash 5 PumpkinSmash 5 pumpkins scattered throughout the level.Help the Thin ManFind the axe at the construction site and give it to the Thin Man waiting by the Haunted House.Restore Power to the DishGrind the electrical wire that's filled with branches leading up to the upper-class home.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.AirportLocation: An indoor, straight-line airport.[CR]Airport is a level that is akin to the Downhill Jam and Mall levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Like those levels, Airport is built in a single straight line that leads to a dead end. Unlike those levels, the level doesn't end when reaching the bottom. The level consists of four floors. The first floor is where the baggage room, helipad and main corridor are. The corridor has a automated walkway and access to bathroom facilities. The baggage room is exactly what it sounds like. It can be accessed through the helipad, which can be accessed from the baggage claim counter at the start of the level. The second level consists of another walkway, metal detectors and more bathrooms. The third level drops down from a large escalator and consists of a series of benches, a large half-pipe and a giant, window-walled atrium. The atrium contains a series of rails that support 10 flags. The fourth level is underneath the end of the level. Players can drop down to a level below the atrium where there are a numerous amount of baggage carts, quarter-pipes and ramps.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 75,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 150,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 300,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Airwalk Over an Escalator (Vert Skaters)Perform an Airwalk over one of the level's escalators at the end of the level.Crooked Grind Around the Baggage Claim (Street Skaters)Perform a Crooked Grind around the Baggage Claim wheel.Visit 10 CountriesGrind through/over 10 flags that hang off of the rails in the Atrium.Get the Tickets to Your Skate BuddyGrab the tickets at the beginning of the level and bring them to a skateboarder at the end of the level whilst avoiding obstacles along the way.Stop the PickpocketsThere are 5 pickpockets located in the level, each dressed in black and holding sacks of money.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.Skater Island - Competition LevelLocation: A real-world skatepark located in Rhode Island.[CR]Skater Island is the second competition level. It was a real-world skatepark located in Rhode Island, USA. In May, 2004, the part closed due to the roof collapsing. It features a large half-pipe, two wooden bowls and a stretch of street funboxes and rails. The level also features two outdoor areas. The first can be accessed through a door at the end of the level that leads to an exterior funbox and a selection of rails. The second area can be accessed by grinding a pirate flag found in the level. A pirate ship outside the level blows cannons into the wall and creates a path to the ship. The ship has a selection of quarter-pipes and ramps. The blown wall is this level's destructible element.Los AngelesLocation: An outdoor, fictional downtown area of Los Angeles.[CR]Los Angeles is one of the biggest level of the entire game. It is split into 6 different areas. The first, the level's start point, is the Complex. It is near a high-raised area that leads directly to the Complex building. The building has a series of planters that can be grinded or aired over as a gap and is directly next to two large staircases. There is a wire that leads up to the top of the building onto it's roof. This area leads directly into the second area, the streets.[CR]The streets circle around the level, near the movie theatre, the inset building, the fire truck and the Car Wash. In the middle of the level is the third area, the Art Park. The park holds weird, stupid post-modern sculptures that act as half-pipes, tunnels and quarter-pipes. Next to this area is the Car Wash, the fourth area. The car wash can be entered (for no reason) and has ramp-like walls. It's rooftop has a half-pipe and the area surrounding the car wash is walled in quarter-pipes. Directly next to this area is the Apartment Buildings, the fifth area. It has a large fountain, a rooftop half-pipe and a raised area featuring a host of ledges. There is a hidden, underground half-pipe here. The sixth and final area can be accessed through the roof in the first area. It's the over-head highway. At the start of the level, the highway is inaccessible since cars pass too fast to allow players to cross it. The level's destructible element is the trigger of a massive earthquake that wrecks most of the level. This causes the highway to break into several sections, allowing the player to access and cross it.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 100,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 190,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 400,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.One Foot Japan the Tower Poppin' Transfer (Vert Skaters)Perform a One Foot Japan from the lower quarter-pipe onto the roof half-pipe in the apartments.Varial Kickflip the Tower Rails Gap (Street Skaters)Perform a Varial Kickflip in the air while grind-transfering a set of stair rails.Get Chuck UnstuckSimply ram into the poor gentleman who's tongue is stuck onto a pole.Free Ballin'Jump onto the two balls in the Art Park.Start the EarthquakeGrind the four "____tremor!" rails in the level to trigger the earthquake.Block the Car ChaseThis goal requires the "Start the Earthquake" goal to be complete. Once that is done, go up to the highway and grind on a loosely-hanging billboard so it smashes a runaway car in the streets below.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.Tokyo - Competition LevelLocation: A Tokyo, high-tech skatepark.[CR]Tokyo is the third and final competition level. It is set at night in a large, enclosed, Shibuya-like area of Japan. It features a lot of vert bowls, half-pipes and quarter pipes. Most of it's edges are lined in neon and there are a few arc-shaped rails and overhead walkways. Tokyo features an incredible amount of hidden areas. Glass windows, electronic billboards and overhead half-pipes all decorate the level as secret areas. There's an airborne blimp that floats in the sky that supports a suspended, holographic-like platform that makes cool computer noises when riding on it. Tokyo is arguably the most visually impressive level of the game.Cruise ShipLocation: A cruise boat.[CR]Cruise Ship is an unlockable, technically secret, level. However, it features actual Career Mode goals. The ship itself features an upper deck with a pool and water-slide. The lower level has a party deck with patio chairs and tables along with a large, oversized wedding cake. The lowest level is the side of the ship which features a vegetation atrium, the front of the ship that has a perfect, Titanic-esque point and is filled with ramps and quarter-pipes as well as a museum dedicated to the ship. The side opposite of the atrium is a hallway with doors to cabins and rescue boats. The player can jump off the ship but will fall into a hazard and respawn on the boat.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 150,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 225,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 500,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Invert the High Wires (Vert Skaters)Perform an Invert liptrick on the high wires above the pool.

From Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.[CR]Warehouse is situated in a dark warehouse and features a hill drop, walls decked with quarter-pipes, a boxed-up taxi cab and a large half-pipe sitting underneath a glass-walled overhang.BurnsideComplete the game 100% six times. From Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.[CR]Burnside is located underneath a highway and is a replica of an actual skatepark. It features a variety of vert structures such as bowls, quarter pipes and snake bowl-like areas. It is the second competition level.RoswellComplete the game 100% nine times.

		<title_clean>Top Gear Rally</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Top Gear Rally is a racing game developed by Boss Game Studios and published by Midway and Kemco (in the US), The Games Ltd. (in the UK), and Kotobuki System Co. (in Japan) for the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Game Boy Advance version of the game was developed by Tantalus Interactive and published by Kotobuki System.[CR]Top Gear Rally was Boss Games' attempt to bring the successful Top Gear franchise of the SNES over to the N64. This entry in the series was slower than many other racing games on the N64 at the time, instead of overcoming a pack of cars your car would often just pass a single car at a time. There were only five courses in the game but they each had various seasons and times of day that would change the look of the environment. Courses would unlock as you progressed through the game; Island, Jungle, Desert and Mountain, with a fifth Industrial area course unlocked at the end of the championship. Playing further years of the championship would unlock mirrored courses and non-standard weather conditions for each course. The game also featured a paint shop where you could paint your car however you wanted.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change Paint Job[CR]At the Decal screen, hold L, R, and Left C, Right C, or Top C.  As you hold, press Up and Down to lighten and darken the paint job.  The color depends on which C button your holding.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Glitch: go past track limits[CR]Start the Jungle stage with a fast car. Go through the first or the second tunnel shortcut and go left (in reverse). Then you will reach the bridge (the normal way). Place your car under it and go to the left side. There is an elevation. Go to the top and turn back. You must be watching to the other side of the bridge (the wall). It has a part like a triangle in the left side of the bridge that you can climb on. If you reach the top, you will be at the left of the track, on the grass. There you can go until the floor ends and you fall. You can see other parts of the scenery from there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Mirror Cars[CR] Beat the 6th year. As you select your car press C-Down to toggle between mirror &amp; normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change the camera in the into demos[CR]In the intro demos(with the cars racing) to cycle through the camera angles simply press the C buttons clockwise. e.g. C-right, then C-down, then C-left (this will rotate through the different camera angles one by one).</plot>

		<plot>The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the original Top Gear Rally.[CR]Along with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important.[CR]New sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.[CR]Much like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges.[CR]You can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Code[CR]Enter the following code at the main menu:</plot>

		<title_clean>Toy Story 2 - Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue!</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is a game based on the movie of the same name and was developed by Traveller's Tales Ltd. and published by Activision for the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PC and Sega Dreamcast. A Game Boy Color port of the game was also developed by Tiertex Design Studios and the publishing of the port was handled by THQ.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is a traditional style 3D platformer in which players take upon control of protagonist Buzz Lightyear as he attempts to rescue his best friend Woody after he is kidnapped by the evil Al McWhiggin.[CR]As is typical with the genre players have access to both a single and double jump and have to variations of attack to defeat the various enemies and bosses scattered throughout the game. The first form of attack utilises Buzz's wrist layer and fires a single projectile to damage enemies. This can be done from either the third or first person perspective as the game allows players to make precision shots from a first person viewpoint. The second of Lightyears' attacks is a spin attack to damage enemies with his pop out wings. Both of these attacks may also be charged resulting in a more powerful form of the attack although charging the spin move will leave players vulnerable for a short period of time after its execution. The game also features 5 different power-ups which are needed to help players complete certain tasks and these are permanently unlocked to be used in other levels once players recover one of Mr Potato Head's missing body pieces during the first level of each zone. The five power-ups are:Cosmic Shield - a shield which protects Buzz from damage and hazards in the environment.Disk Launcher - the disk launcher helps to defeat enemies in the harder to reach places.Rocket Boots - these give Buzz a speed boost for a short period of time.Grappling Hook - this allows Buzz to reach high places.Hover Boots - these allow Buzz to hover for a brief moment in order to reach specific platforms.[CR]Finally scattered throughout the stages often on harder to reach platforms are limited use upgrades such as a more powerful laser upgrade which increases the damage of the laser attack but comes with a limited amount of potential shots.[CR]The game contains 15 levels in total split into 5 zones consisting of 3 levels per zone (which follow the pattern of two objective based levels followed by a boss level). The gameplay centres around collecting Pizza Planet tokens to advance onto further levels in the game and although there contains five tokens per stage only one is required to progress onto the next level in the game and a set number of tokens being required in order to access the boss stage at the end of each zone.[CR]The five ways to unlock the Pizza Planet tokens within each stage are:Collecting 50 coins for Hamm.Finding 5 of Bo-Peep's lost sheep.Defeating RC Car in a race or completing Slinky's time trial challenge.Solving a puzzle or reaching a typically hard to reach location.Defeating a mini-boss within the stage.Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me.[CR]As previously alluded to on the first level of each zone Mr Potato Head appears requesting Buzz recover a missing body part of his, rewarding the player with one of the five aforementioned possible power-ups for doing so. Obtaining these power-ups are essential to collecting all of the tokens within the game as several of the tokens are only obtainable using specific power-ups.[CR]Finally Buzz's dinosaur pal Rex provides advice and hints about the current level and tells players where in the level they can find the mini-boss to defeat in order to obtain the token awarded for doing so.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Example level select screen.Andy's HouseAndy's NeighbourhoodBombs Away! (Boss Level)Construction YardAlleys and GulliesSlime Time! (Boss Level)Al's Toy BarnAl's Space LandToy Barn Encounter! (Boss Level)Elevator HopAl's PenthouseThe Evil Emperor Zurg! (Boss Level)Airport InfiltrationTarmac TroubleProspector Showdown! (Boss Level)[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]It's not flying, its falling with style.[CR]The game's plot follows that of the film pretty closely and like the film begins with the kidnapping of Woody by evil collector Al McWhiggin outside of Andy's house. The game then follows Buzz Lightyear and his companions as they set out to rescue the captured cowboy as the traverse the nearby neighbourhood, Al's Toy Barn, Al's penthouse and finally the airport terminal and tarmac at the film's end.[CR]Unlike the film however the game closes after Buzz Lightyear defeats Stinky Pete (aided by two henchmen) in a final battle, contrary to the films actual ending.[CR]Differences Between Versions[CR]There are many noticeable differences across the different versions of the game. This includes the game having a different soundtrack across the multiple platforms on which it was released. An example would be the first level of the game (Andy's House) which featured a unique soundtrack in the PS1, Dreamcast and PC release of the game. The N64 release though featured significantly different audio from the other versions of the game most likely due to the hardware differences between the various consoles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the main menu, enter Up, Up, Up, Up, Down, Down, Up, Up, Down, Down, Down (using the analog stick, not the control pad). You should hear a sound of a goat.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game begins with a Native American named Tal'set who has found himself in the Lost Land. He is a Turok, a warrior with the ability to travel through time and entrusted to protect an entity known as the Light Burden. He has undertaken a mission to stop an evil cyborg known as The Campaigner. The Campaigner plans to find the pieces of a weapon known as the Chronocepter and magnify its power in order to destroy the barriers that separate time and space and conquer the Lost Land and eventually the universe. Players are given control of Turok (Tal'set) and must travel through various worlds in order to find the pieces of the Chronocepter and eventually use it to destroy The Campaigner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Turok travels through various levels in search of keys which are used in order to travel to the next world via a hub. The game mixes platforming elements, with first person action and puzzle solving. Turok travels through jungles, underwater caverns, catacombs, ancient cities, and, in the end of the game, he adventures through the Campaigner's fortress. Players can acquire extra weapons placed throughout the levels of the game as well as runes which give them extra lives. The weapons also have the option for alternate ammo, such as explosive shotgun rounds and explosive arrows for the tek bow.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Knife: A basic knife, relatively weakBow and Arrow: Bow which can be charged to shoot arrows for longer distances and for more damage.

		<title_clean>Turok - Rage Wars</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]     Turok: Rage Wars is a arena-based first-person shooter developed by       Acclaim Austin and published by      Acclaim for the Nintendo 64 on October 31, 1999. A spinoff of the     Turok video game franchise, Turok: Rage Wars focuses on multiplayer arena matches rather than a single-player story campaign. The game is very similar in concept to                                       Unreal Tournament and                                      Quake III: Arena, which were released shortly after Rage Wars. A completely different Turok game with the same name was released for the                                     Game Boy Color in December 26, 1999 (as a 2D platformer). The game supports up to four players at a time with a combination of split-screen multiplayer and  AI bots. The game also contains a single-player campaign mode, dubbed Trials Mode. In that mode, you must complete various deathmatch challenges in various game modes (including boss fights) with each available character to unlock weapons for use in Trials Mode, extra skins for that character, and playable characters in Multiplayer and Trials Mode. A special version of Trials Mode can be played with two players, though early versions have a glitch that makes completing the mode impossible.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]The game contains four game modes, each can be played up to 4 players (or bots): Bloodlust - Standard                                   deathmatch.Team Bloodlust - Standard                                  team deathmatch.Capture the Flag -                                 Capture the flag focused on a neutral flag.Frag Tag - In this game, a random player changes to a monkey,                                chicken, or a harmless baby                              raptor. Their goal is to find a target area to enter while the other players try to frag it.[CR]Weapons [CR]Each player can have up to six weapons at a time: the Warhammer, a choice of two bullet weapons, a choice of two energy weapons, and a choice of one explosive weapon. The only characters with exceptions are                             Tal'set, who has access to all the weapons at once, the Raptor, who uses claws, and the Mites, who bites or spits acid. Each weapon has both a primary and secondary function, share ammo with other weapon types, and is sometimes limited in use in Trials Mode. Bullet WeaponsMag 60 - Standard                            pistol that either fires a three-round burst or a powerful, laser-assisted, single shot. (At the cost of both ammo and movement)Shotgun - Standard                           shotgun that also has a "Street Sweeper" firing mode (fires four shells at the same time accurately).Assault Rifle - Standard                          assault rifle that has a single shot or rapid fire mode.Minigun - Powerful                         minigun that includes a shield that can absorb damage at the cost of energy ammo while still allowing you to fire.Energy Weapons Tek Bow -                   Bow and arrow. Used for long-range sniping.Plasma Rifle - Standard                  plasma rifle that's similar to the Tek Bow.Boomerang - A                 boomerang. Locks onto enemies while aiming the boomerang. Secondary throw slows down enemies at the cost of more energy ammo.Radioactive Flare Gun -                Flare gun with two flare sizes: small (green) and large (purple).Freeze Gun - Energy weapon that fires beams that either slow down enemies or               freeze them.Emaciator - Fires electric balls that shrinks the enemy.Inflator - Fires beams that inflates the enemy.Chestburster - Unlocked after beating the Warehouse with the Mantid Soldier. Fires a beam that implants the enemies with an alien. If that enemy doesn't kill you, an alien pops out of his chest a la    Alien, killing him instantly.Explosive Weapons Scorpion Launcher -                       Rocket launcher. Secondary function sets a magnetic field that attracts rockets.Napalm Gel -                      Remote mine launcher. Grenade Launcher -                    Grenade launcher with two firing modes: One that explodes after a few bounces and one that explodes after direct contact.Other Weapons  Warhammer - The basic melee weapon for every character (except Raptor and Mites).  Has a normal swing and a charged swing (dealing more damage). Uses no ammo. Cerebral Bore - Classic item from              Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. You must lock on to an enemy to use it (and it takes some time), pierces the skull for heavy damage and paralyzation. Sentry Turret - Deployable sentry gun item. Fires rapid laser beams.PFM Mines -          Proximity mines. Can hurt enemies, teammates, and yourself.Iron Claw - Basic         bear trap item that deals small damage over a short period of time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Create a character and save it. Get over 500 career kills with that character. Make sure to save that character when he is over 500 kills. Copy that character to the other three slots on the controller pak. Then you will oad all four of the cloned characters, and the total kills should be over 2000. All the cheats will be available in the cheat menu. Hit Z at the main menu to turn on the cheats.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]     Turok: Rage Wars is a arena-based first-person shooter developed by       Acclaim Austin and published by      Acclaim for the Nintendo 64 on October 31, 1999. A spinoff of the     Turok video game franchise, Turok: Rage Wars focuses on multiplayer arena matches rather than a single-player story campaign. The game is very similar in concept to                                       Unreal Tournament and                                      Quake III: Arena, which were released shortly after Rage Wars. A completely different Turok game with the same name was released for the                                     Game Boy Color in December 26, 1999 (as a 2D platformer). The game supports up to four players at a time with a combination of split-screen multiplayer and  AI bots. The game also contains a single-player campaign mode, dubbed Trials Mode. In that mode, you must complete various deathmatch challenges in various game modes (including boss fights) with each available character to unlock weapons for use in Trials Mode, extra skins for that character, and playable characters in Multiplayer and Trials Mode. A special version of Trials Mode can be played with two players, though early versions have a glitch that makes completing the mode impossible.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]The game contains four game modes, each can be played up to 4 players (or bots): Bloodlust - Standard                                   deathmatch.Team Bloodlust - Standard                                  team deathmatch.Capture the Flag -                                 Capture the flag focused on a neutral flag.Frag Tag - In this game, a random player changes to a monkey,                                chicken, or a harmless baby                              raptor. Their goal is to find a target area to enter while the other players try to frag it.[CR]Weapons [CR]Each player can have up to six weapons at a time: the Warhammer, a choice of two bullet weapons, a choice of two energy weapons, and a choice of one explosive weapon. The only characters with exceptions are                             Tal'set, who has access to all the weapons at once, the Raptor, who uses claws, and the Mites, who bites or spits acid. Each weapon has both a primary and secondary function, share ammo with other weapon types, and is sometimes limited in use in Trials Mode. Bullet WeaponsMag 60 - Standard                            pistol that either fires a three-round burst or a powerful, laser-assisted, single shot. (At the cost of both ammo and movement)Shotgun - Standard                           shotgun that also has a "Street Sweeper" firing mode (fires four shells at the same time accurately).Assault Rifle - Standard                          assault rifle that has a single shot or rapid fire mode.Minigun - Powerful                         minigun that includes a shield that can absorb damage at the cost of energy ammo while still allowing you to fire.Energy Weapons Tek Bow -                   Bow and arrow. Used for long-range sniping.Plasma Rifle - Standard                  plasma rifle that's similar to the Tek Bow.Boomerang - A                 boomerang. Locks onto enemies while aiming the boomerang. Secondary throw slows down enemies at the cost of more energy ammo.Radioactive Flare Gun -                Flare gun with two flare sizes: small (green) and large (purple).Freeze Gun - Energy weapon that fires beams that either slow down enemies or               freeze them.Emaciator - Fires electric balls that shrinks the enemy.Inflator - Fires beams that inflates the enemy.Chestburster - Unlocked after beating the Warehouse with the Mantid Soldier. Fires a beam that implants the enemies with an alien. If that enemy doesn't kill you, an alien pops out of his chest a la    Alien, killing him instantly.Explosive Weapons Scorpion Launcher -                       Rocket launcher. Secondary function sets a magnetic field that attracts rockets.Napalm Gel -                      Remote mine launcher. Grenade Launcher -                    Grenade launcher with two firing modes: One that explodes after a few bounces and one that explodes after direct contact.Other Weapons  Warhammer - The basic melee weapon for every character (except Raptor and Mites).  Has a normal swing and a charged swing (dealing more damage). Uses no ammo. Cerebral Bore - Classic item from              Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. You must lock on to an enemy to use it (and it takes some time), pierces the skull for heavy damage and paralyzation. Sentry Turret - Deployable sentry gun item. Fires rapid laser beams.PFM Mines -          Proximity mines. Can hurt enemies, teammates, and yourself.Iron Claw - Basic         bear trap item that deals small damage over a short period of time.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Turok 2 - Seeds of Evil</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]A sequel to the original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter on the Nintendo 64. It was also the first Nintendo 64 game to feature support for the Expansion Pak, which doubled the total amount of RAM in the Nintendo 64 from 4 MB to 8 MB. This allowed for a greater screen resolution, higher frame rate, and more detailed graphics.[CR]The story revolves around Joshua Fireseed, the modern Turok (taking the title from Tal'Set of the previous game) who is teleported into an alternate dimension by a female alien named Adon. She explains that the elders of the Lazarus Concordance need Turok's help in order to defeat the Primagen, an alien who seeks to free himself from his spacecraft, where he has been sealed for thousands of years, in order to enslave all life.[CR]The Primagen is using other creatures to attempt to destroy the energy totems of The Lost Land that maintain the seal over his spaceship. Turok's task is to protect each of the five totems and then defeat the Primagen himself.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Level 1: Port of Adia - A once bustling coastal city that has been devastated by the invading Dinosoids.[CR]Level 2: River of Souls - The water that flows through this river is imbued with the power of death itself, making travelling along it incredibly dangerous.[CR]Level 3: The Death Marshes - An ancient swamp that is home to more than one sentient race that wishes to see Turok dead.[CR]Level 4: The Lair of the Blind Ones - A pitch-black series of tunnels where eyeless creatures who have evolved perfect adaptation to the dark have an advantage over Turok.[CR]Level 5: Hive of the Mantids - The enormous labyrinthine home of a race of sentient insectoids who don't like mammals very much.[CR]Level 6: Primagen's Lightship - The starship the Primagen used to escape his home dimension eons ago, which crashed into the Lost Lands and was sealed under a magical barrier by the Lazarus Concordance, in order to prevent the Primagen from escaping and enslaving all life.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Talons -- Used as claws that attach to Turok's handsets[CR]Damage: Low[CR]Range: Low[CR]Warblade -- An upgrade of the Talons. These claws have a higher damage output for an close range encounter, and also function underwater.[CR]Damage: Medium[CR]Range: Low[CR]Bow and Arrow -- Standard bow and arrow used by Turok. The longer the player holds the trigger the further the arrow will travel and the more damage it will do.[CR]Damage: Low[CR]Range: Long[CR]Tek Bow -- Upgraded version of the bow and arrow. "Charges" faster, has a higher damage output, has a sniper scope for more accurate arrow placement, and can fire Tek Arrows that explode on impact.[CR]Damage: Medium[CR]Range: Long[CR]Pistol -- Standard 9mm pistol useful for standard enemies in earlier levels and weak enemies in later levels.[CR]Damage: Low[CR]Range: Long[CR]Flare -- Used to light up dark corridors. Causes no damage to anything. Unlimited charges, but must recharge between each shot. A very impressive feat of locational lighting for its time.[CR]Damage: NA[CR]Range: Long[CR]Mag .60 -- An upgraded version of the pistol. This will fire three rounds for each time the player fires and has a better damage output per bullet.[CR]Damage: Medium[CR]Range: Long[CR]Harpoon Gun -- Only usable underwater, the harpoon gun spears your enemies with merciless steel.[CR]Damage: Low[CR]Range: Long[CR]Torpedo Launcher -- Only usable underwater, this fires powerful exploding torpedoes at enemies with a much higher damage output than the harpoon gun. In addition, even if you have no torpedoes, the launcher itself has a portable impeller on it that allows Turok to swim much faster while it is selected.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Long[CR]Tranquilizer Gun -- Using this on an enemy will put them to sleep for a short time and works on almost any enemy. However, if the enemy wakes up it will harbour a serious grudge.[CR]Damage: NA[CR]Range: Long[CR]Charge Dart Rifle -- An upgraded version of the tranquilizer gun. Shocks an enemy which paralyzes them for a short time.[CR]Damage: NA[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Plasma Rifle -- Fires plasma shells rapidly. Equipped with a sniper scope to attack enemies at long range.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Long[CR]Cerebral Bore -- One of the most famous weapons in all of gaming, this delightful little gadget will lock on to the brain activity of an enemy and fire a small orb which attaches to an enemy's head, drills into their skull, and sucks out their brain in the form of a gooey liquid, before exploding violently and decapitating them for good measure. The major drawbacks are that it cannot fire until it achieves a lock on an enemy's brain patterns, which is difficult with fast-moving enemies, and can only happen at relatively close range. In addition, the Bore is useless against enemies wearing protective headgear, or non-sentient enemies whose brain activity is not powerful enough to achieve a lock.[CR]Damage: One shot, one kill[CR]Range: Long[CR]Shotgun -- A single-barred pump action shotgun. Oh yes. Devastating at close range.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Shredder -- An upgraded version of the shotgun. Not only will this double the damage output but also the shells will have the ability to ricochet off of walls.[CR]Damage: Very High[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Razor Wind -- A ridiculously sharp buzzsaw-shaped glaive that flies through the air, severing arms, legs, and heads as it goes, and then returns to Turok's hand, slick with gore.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Long[CR]Grenade Launcher -- Propels grenades at your enemies and will explode on impact.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Firestorm Cannon -- Essentially this weapon is a high powered minigun that fires exploding energy bullets. Exactly as satisfying as it sounds. Takes a second to warm up as you begin firing.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Flamethrower -- This will set enemies on fire for a high damage output.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Sunfire Pods -- Odd natural growths found only in the Lost Lands, Sunfire Pods release a quick burst of incredibly bright light when broken. Turok throws them like grenades in order to temporarily blind his enemies. The Blind Ones in particular, who evolved in eternal blackness, are so sensitive to light that the light burst will cause their heads to burst into flames, killing them instantly.[CR]Damage: None or Lethal, depending on target[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Proximity Fragramation Mine (PFM) Layer -- This device will lay proximity mines along the ground. When an enemies get close enough, the mines will jump into the air to knee-height and explode, severing unlucky enemies' legs and leaving them to quickly bleed to death in horrific agony.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Scorpion Missile Launcher -- Will lock on to a single enemy and then fire a barrage of missiles. Almost nothing can survive even one barrage.[CR]Damage: Very High[CR]Range: Long[CR]The Nuke -- Judged by the Lazarus Concordence to be too powerful to allow anyone to use, this portable Weapon of Mass Destruction was broken into pieces, which were then scattered across the Lost Land, and Turok must find each and every piece in order to use it. The Nuke takes a very long time to charge up before firing, and ammo is very rare, but when it finally goes off, watch out. It fires a bullet into whatever it's pointed at that triggers an enormous energy burst which instantly incinerates every single enemy in the area, leaving behind crispy statues of ash in the shape of the enemies, yet is handily harmless to Turok.[CR]Damage: Utterly Lethal[CR]Range: Infinite[CR]Items[CR]Yellow Health -- Raises your health by 100 points (Ultra Health)[CR]Red Health -- Raises your health to 100 points[CR]Blue Health -- Raises your health 10 points[CR]Silver Health -- Raises your health 10 points[CR]Satchel Charge -- Used to destroy objectives[CR]Level Key -- Found in every level, used to open up new levels[CR]Red Life Force -- Gives you 10 life force points (100 points will earn an extra life)[CR]Yellow Life Force -- Gives you 1 life force point (100 points will earn an extra life)[CR]Eagle Feather -- Take them to Talisman Chambers to receive a special ability[CR]Primagen Key -- You have to open up the door in the center of the HUB.[CR]Cave Door Key -- Used to unlock caves in the Lair of the Blind Ones[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Dinosoids[CR]Raptoid -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid equipped with basic weapons.[CR]Endtrail -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid equipped with advanced weapons.[CR]Fireborn -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid that has various flame-type attacks.[CR]Dinosaurs[CR]Compy -- The tiny Compsognathus aren't much of a threat individually, but they always travel in groups.[CR]Raptor -- Classic dinosaur enemy, very fast and lethal if not taken down quickly. Smart enough to allow for Cerebral Bore lock.[CR]Dimorphodon -- Murderous creatures that can fly and attack quickly.[CR]The Blind Ones[CR]Sentinel -- Standard minion equipped with an axe and grenades.[CR]Guardian -- Guardians are equpped with a crossbow to take Turok down at range.[CR]Pur-Linn Warriors[CR]War Club -- Standard Pur-Linn that uses mostly physical attacks.[CR]Gunner -- A smaller Pur-Linn equipped with a Gatling gun[CR]Juggernaut -- The largest of the species equipped with a giant sword.[CR]The Deadkin[CR]Deadman -- A zombie-like creature that can either attack in melee combat or throw one of it's ribs at you. If blown in half, it will crawl towards Turok in an attempt to deal more damage.[CR]Lord of the Dead -- Larger than the standard deadman, these guys have fireballs as well as melee combat.[CR]Sister of Despair -- These creatures are essentially floating torsos that cast energy skulls at Turok.[CR]The Mantids[CR]Mite -- Smaller creatures that crave the delicious taste of Human feet.[CR]Worker -- Standard Mantid that attacks with their claws.[CR]Drone -- Equipped with a jetpack and a laser rifle, a drone can fly as it chooses and do a great deal of damage.[CR]Soldier -- Large cockroach-looking creature. They are equipped with laser rifles and plasma balls.[CR]The Primagen's Personal Minions[CR]Trooper -- Well-armoured mutants equipped with a laser rifle and mini-gun.[CR]Bio-Bot -- These creatures are cyborgs equipped with a laser rifle.[CR]Elite Guard -- The most power minion, these are much larger troopers equipped with a mini-gun.[CR]The Flesh Eaters[CR]Sentinel -- Standard mutant-looking creature equipped with a sword and grenades.[CR]Death Guard -- Standard mutant-looking creature equipped with a sword and a rifle.[CR]Lord of the Flesh -- The toughest of the Flesh Eaters, cast spell like attacks.[CR]Unaffiliated Enemies[CR]Leaper -- A dog-like creature that can approach quickly for heavy damage.[CR]Cave Worm -- A large greyish worm that comes up from the ground.[CR]Fire Worm -- Slightly smaller than the cave worm, they can appear from the ground and attack with fireballs.[CR]Skimmer -- These are essentially smaller green snakes, always travel in groups.[CR]Cave Spider (Infant) -- Smaller spiders, usually don't appear alone.[CR]Cave Spider (Adult) -- Much bigger and more damaging that an infant, these spiders are fast and can spit venom at Turok.[CR]Swamp Wasp -- A smaller wasp that can sting Turok for a low amount of damage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Enter these codes at the Cheat Menu option:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility Glitch[CR]If you are taken to zero health (death) as you fall into a save point, you will be able to exit the save point completely invincible. Your health will still be at zero, and the glitch will wear off if regenerate any health. As long as you keep your health at zero, you can stay invincible forever.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Deathmatches in Solo Mode[CR]This reportedly works on black cartridges only. [CR]Enter the master cheat ''BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND'' and go to a deathmatch. Select options, level, and characters as normal. Enter the match. Now go to the ''Warp'' cheats and select any level to warp to. Select it TWICE, because it won't send you there the first time. [CR]You are now in a single player level with all your multiplayer options and players! up to 4 can join the fun, but it lags badly unless you only have 2 players.Warps do not work and you cannot pick up the single player items. [CR]Try this on level 2, and with other cheats on [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] No Damage From Undead In River of Souls.[CR]In level 2, one of the most annoying enemies in the entire game pops up in the graveyard and soul gate sections -- undead. They swarm you and attack by throwing blood at you, which can drastically mess with the game's shoddy frame rate and really mess you up, and even kill you despite the small damage.There's a simple trick to get around this, though. Just turn the blood off in the options menu, and presto! The undead animation to throw blood at you still happens, but since the blood is turned off they won't actually throw anything at you. Now the undead go from one of the most annoying enemies to the easiest, and the best part of all is this doesn't mess with the game's true ending trigger. If you use cheats to clear Turok 2, the game doesn't give you the true ending. But apparently, messing up swarms of enemies by turning the blood off is a-okay.</plot>

Not only will this double the damage output but also the shells will have the ability to ricochet off of walls.[CR]Damage: Very High[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Razor Wind -- A ridiculously sharp buzzsaw-shaped glaive that flies through the air, severing arms, legs, and heads as it goes, and then returns to Turok's hand, slick with gore.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Long[CR]Grenade Launcher -- Propels grenades at your enemies and will explode on impact.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Firestorm Cannon -- Essentially this weapon is a high powered minigun that fires exploding energy bullets. Exactly as satisfying as it sounds. Takes a second to warm up as you begin firing.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Flamethrower -- This will set enemies on fire for a high damage output.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Sunfire Pods -- Odd natural growths found only in the Lost Lands, Sunfire Pods release a quick burst of incredibly bright light when broken. Turok throws them like grenades in order to temporarily blind his enemies. The Blind Ones in particular, who evolved in eternal blackness, are so sensitive to light that the light burst will cause their heads to burst into flames, killing them instantly.[CR]Damage: None or Lethal, depending on target[CR]Range: Medium[CR]Proximity Fragramation Mine (PFM) Layer -- This device will lay proximity mines along the ground. When an enemies get close enough, the mines will jump into the air to knee-height and explode, severing unlucky enemies' legs and leaving them to quickly bleed to death in horrific agony.[CR]Damage: High[CR]Range: Low[CR]Scorpion Missile Launcher -- Will lock on to a single enemy and then fire a barrage of missiles. Almost nothing can survive even one barrage.[CR]Damage: Very High[CR]Range: Long[CR]The Nuke -- Judged by the Lazarus Concordence to be too powerful to allow anyone to use, this portable Weapon of Mass Destruction was broken into pieces, which were then scattered across the Lost Land, and Turok must find each and every piece in order to use it. The Nuke takes a very long time to charge up before firing, and ammo is very rare, but when it finally goes off, watch out. It fires a bullet into whatever it's pointed at that triggers an enormous energy burst which instantly incinerates every single enemy in the area, leaving behind crispy statues of ash in the shape of the enemies, yet is handily harmless to Turok.[CR]Damage: Utterly Lethal[CR]Range: Infinite[CR]Items[CR]Yellow Health -- Raises your health by 100 points (Ultra Health)[CR]Red Health -- Raises your health to 100 points[CR]Blue Health -- Raises your health 10 points[CR]Silver Health -- Raises your health 10 points[CR]Satchel Charge -- Used to destroy objectives[CR]Level Key -- Found in every level, used to open up new levels[CR]Red Life Force -- Gives you 10 life force points (100 points will earn an extra life)[CR]Yellow Life Force -- Gives you 1 life force point (100 points will earn an extra life)[CR]Eagle Feather -- Take them to Talisman Chambers to receive a special ability[CR]Primagen Key -- You have to open up the door in the center of the HUB.[CR]Cave Door Key -- Used to unlock caves in the Lair of the Blind Ones[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Dinosoids[CR]Raptoid -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid equipped with basic weapons.[CR]Endtrail -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid equipped with advanced weapons.[CR]Fireborn -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid that has various flame-type attacks.[CR]Dinosaurs[CR]Compy -- The tiny Compsognathus aren't much of a threat individually, but they always travel in groups.[CR]Raptor -- Classic dinosaur enemy, very fast and lethal if not taken down quickly. Smart enough to allow for Cerebral Bore lock.[CR]Dimorphodon -- Murderous creatures that can fly and attack quickly.[CR]The Blind Ones[CR]Sentinel -- Standard minion equipped with an axe and grenades.[CR]Guardian -- Guardians are equpped with a crossbow to take Turok down at range.[CR]Pur-Linn Warriors[CR]War Club -- Standard Pur-Linn that uses mostly physical attacks.[CR]Gunner -- A smaller Pur-Linn equipped with a Gatling gun[CR]Juggernaut -- The largest of the species equipped with a giant sword.[CR]The Deadkin[CR]Deadman -- A zombie-like creature that can either attack in melee combat or throw one of it's ribs at you. If blown in half, it will crawl towards Turok in an attempt to deal more damage.[CR]Lord of the Dead -- Larger than the standard deadman, these guys have fireballs as well as melee combat.[CR]Sister of Despair -- These creatures are essentially floating torsos that cast energy skulls at Turok.[CR]The Mantids[CR]Mite -- Smaller creatures that crave the delicious taste of Human feet.[CR]Worker -- Standard Mantid that attacks with their claws.[CR]Drone -- Equipped with a jetpack and a laser rifle, a drone can fly as it chooses and do a great deal of damage.[CR]Soldier -- Large cockroach-looking creature.

		<plot>When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed in Turok 2: Seeds of Evil the resulting explosion created a shockwave throughout the universe. This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. [CR]The third title in the Turok series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.[CR]Turok 2's multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.</plot>

		<title_clean>Vigilante 8</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Vigilante 8, which was released in July of 1998, is a vehicular combat game which and was a spin off of the  PC game  Interstate '76. Vigilante 8 was later re-released on the  Xbox Live Arcade as  Vigilante 8 Arcade on November 5th 2008, it features improved graphics and new arenas. The games story is about an oil crisis in the 1970s which causes several vehicle based skirmishes to break out throughout the country using advanced and top secret weaponry. Vigilante 8 was developed by a team of only 5 people, far less than the usual  PlayStation development teams.[CR]Character Bios[CR]VigilantesConvoyConvoy, Leader of the Vigilantes[CR]Vigilantes' righteous leader. Originally a trucker, he decided to take the law into his own hands after being repeatedly ambushed by Coyotes on his transport routes.Chassey Blue[CR]A beauty queen and secret government agent from D.C., Chassey joined the Vigilantes as part of her undercover assignment to neutralize the Coyotes.Slick Clyde[CR]A showoff playboy from Texas, Clyde was on his way to an auto show in Alburquerque when Convoy confiscated his truck and forced him to help the Vigilantes. (Now Clyde wants to be the leader.)[CR]Ending: In Slick Clydes ending he stops at a rest stop for a break after defeating the Coyotes. Unfortunately, he happens to reach the same rest stop where Houston broke her mind control device. Slick, being the curious man he is, decides to strap on the fancy looking bracelet. The last scene of the ending shows a newspaper headline, claiming that Slick Clyde has become the new leader of the Coyotes. He reappears as the main villain in the sequel, under the monicker of Lord Clyde.Dave[CR]Dave believes aliens are his friends and has been tracking them for years. He joined the Vigilantes in hope of entering Site-4 and seeing some aliens first hand.John Torque[CR]Torque, John Torque. A one-time Vegas hustler, he was recruited by Convoy for the good cause. Now he's Convoy's right-hand man. Vowed never to gamble again.[CR]Ending: John drives off into the sunset claiming never to gamble again, with HIS money. In the back seat of his car he has a suitcase full of cash that he got once he busted Sid. However, the biggest catch is in John's trunk. John caught Sid and is ready to turn him in, swimming in all the cash he needs.Sheila[CR]Convoy's stubborn 16 year-old niece. Sheila loves all the action. Convoy is furious with her, but she won't let him send her back home.Y the Alien[CR](Information Classified)CoyotesSid Burn, Leader of the Coyotes[CR]Sid Burns[CR]A born arsonist, Sid is the Coyotes' ruthless leader. He was promised $100 million by a foreign oil consortium to destabilize the U.S. economy by wreaking havoc in the southwestBeezwax[CR]An enraged Arizona bee keeper. When his bees were mutated by radiation from government nuclear tests, Beezwax joined the Coyotes in revenge.[CR]Ending: After his victory, Beezwax claims ownership of some Site-4 warheads. The deadly explosives are unfortunately colored yellow and black, the same color pattern of his precious bees. One of his bees lands on the tip of the warhead, accidentally blowing Beezwax up in the process. The same bees that helped Beezwax rise to glory, where the same thing that led to his downfall.Boogie[CR]A die hard dance fan, Boogie is the winner of several disco dancing competitions. When not shaking his booty, Boogie runs dirty jobs for Sid.[CR]Ending: While riding off after defeating the last of his Vigilante enemies, Boogie receives the most anticlimactic ending of all of the Coyotes. He is pulled over by the police and convicted of his past crimes.Houston 3[CR]OMAR's scientists turned Houston into a bionic woman against her will. Half human, half machine, she was programmed to aid Sid in his quest for destruction and chaos.Loki[CR]Former military test pilot of secret craft at Site-4, Loki was released from duty after becoming mentally unstable. He is obsessed with flying and will do anything to pilot one of the saucers again![CR]Ending: Loki finally finds one of the saucers he was waiting to pilot. However, after a long period of absence from the controls of a flying saucer Loki accidentally crashes. Due to Loki's alien like appearance, once he is found he is declared as an alien that crash landed his ship on Earth.Molo[CR]An obnoxious kid from New York, Molo was kicked out of school for bad behavior. He stole a school bus and headed west to play bully with the big boys.[CR]Vehicles[CR]Vigilantes' Vehicles'72 Moth Truck[CR]Convoy's truck is definitely one of the heavier duty vehicles - not only is it one of the larger vehicles in the game, but it is also able to take loads of punishment before it bites the dust. As with all heavy vehicles, one of the key tactics is to ram other vehicles - the faster you're going when you hit, the more damage gets done. In addition, when you're lining yourself up to ram another vehicle, fire some weapons at the same time - as long as you don't blast your victim out of the way, chances are they'll take major punishment.'67 Rattler[CR]Chassey's car, although quite lightly armored still holds up as one of the better choices of characters, due in part to the Rattlers high speed and effectiveness of 'Gridlock'. The main advantage of the rattler is its speed and maneuverability, so try and run circles round your opponents and be sure to get out of there if your in trouble. On the downside, it's quite light and any kind of serious blast can knock the Rattler for six.'70 Van[CR]Overall, Daves vehicle is one of the poorer choices in the game - it's not heavily enough armored to make up for it's lack of speed and is too large to provide much avoidance. Its one saving grace, however, is that it has a reasonable ramming ability for such a small vehicle, so it's wise to use this as much as possible.'69 Jefferson[CR]Torque is a very well-balanced character, even better than other all-rounders. Not too slow , not too poorly armored and with reasonable avoidance, Torque is good for beginners and experts. Because he's pretty good all-round, a variety of tactics are available.'74 Strider[CR]Sheila has probably the smallest vehicle in the game, so you really need to exploit this to make the most of the strider. As far as long range attacks go, the best tactic is to drive in amongst scenery, zipping in different directions to through of weapons. Up close, run circles round your opponents to confuse opponents, all the time using weapons like the Bruiser cannon. This stays focused on the enemy without the need to aim.'70 Clydesdale[CR]Slicks vehicle is a pretty good all-rounder, with both reasonable armor and speed . However, it is also chunkier than other all-rounders and this makes it an easier target for weapons '. The flipside of this is that it has ramming potential, especially when up against weaker all rounders. Overall, the Clydesdale is pretty good, but many players prefer the faster and lighter all-rounders. However, Clydes weapon means that you don't need to be near opponents to nail them...Coyotes' VehiclesManta[CR]Sid is a contender for best character in the game, The Manta compares well with Houstons' Palomino, but seems lighter, allowing it to get some serious air and pull off tighter turns. Driving circles round opponents is no problem, as is getting out of sticky situations. The high speed means that you can often just outrun any incoming missiles, or at least hide in amongst scenery. For a great 'run 'n gun' match, put Sid up against Chassey Blue in Canyonlands and watch them tear up the roadside!'70 Stag Pickup[CR]Beezwax is comparable to Dave, both are reasonably strong, but suffer from being to bulky. This makes them easier targets, although Beezwax can sometimes avoid incoming fire. However, the low speed rating and the fact that he can't really go up against characters like Convoy mean that he'll probably one of you least popular choices.'76 Leprechaun[CR]As with Loki, there's not too much to recommend Boogie, as the low speed and armor make him a sitting duck in the arena. His only saving grace is that because he's small, he can avoid incoming fire or long range attacks.'75 Palamino[CR]Houston has the ability to tear around the arenas with ease, as well as powering up inclines to get those vital wrenches. Compared to Sids and Chasseys vehicles, the Palamino is slightly more sluggish and heavier, but this allows you to use it to ram weaker vehicles, so it's a good trade off.'73 Glenn 4x4[CR]Overall, Loki, isn't the greatest of characters, and if you want a small fast vehicle it's probably best to opt for Sheila instead. However, a good fair-fight deathmatch is if you put Loki up against Sheila. On the plus side, Loki does have a very small vehicle, so, the same tactics apply with Sheila - try not to get into any serious close-combat activity or you'll be totalled.'66 School Bus[CR]Molo is a killer when it comes to ramming - hell, he can even go up against Convoy with pretty good odds! Obviously, the faster you're going, the more damage will be inflicted, so use the 'down-the-hill' method or the afterburner combo to push that speedometer into the red. In addition, let off a few rockets to do extra damage, just make sure you don't knock your target out the way, or you'll go hurtling past barely scraping them.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Aircraft GraveyardCanyonlandsCasino CityGhost TownHoover DamOil FieldsSand FactorySecret BaseSki ResortValley Farms[CR]Special Weapons[CR]Gridlock[CR]Developed for Chassey by government labs, the Gridlock launches an expanding grid of flares. The flares combust on impact in a gaseous discharge, capable of stalling and damaging almost any engine within the grid area.Steel Belter[CR]Advanced weaponry is all well and good, but for Convoy there's nothing like an old truck tire stuffed full of dynamite. Just let it roll and (as luck would have it), it will bounce after the bad guys.Invasion[CR]A small radar dish found at Site-4 finally allowed Dave to establish a channel of communication with the aliens. Now, he doesn't hesitate to call for help when the going gets tough. A swarm of these little saucers spells certain death to anyone who isn't fast enough to outrun them.Bass Quake[CR]Torque bought the best car stereo money could buy and he needed the right speaker box to go with it. This custom-made bad boy has enough bass to ripple the earth!Tantrum Gun[CR]Sheila loves big guns and this 24mm Gatling is as large as her dune buggy can carry. Features an auto-tracking turret. It can knock weapons off enemies' cars!White Lightning[CR]When Slick originally found this large 'rod' at Site-4, he had no idea it was a lightning inducing apparatus. He just thought it was a cool looking antenna! Its charge can fry an electrical system!Gamma Swarm[CR]Don't let Beezwax unleash his mutant killer bees. They will 'sting ya real good!' Can you outrun the swarm?!Disco Inferno[CR]Boogies own invention. An inflatable disco-ball firing explosive flares! Spin, baby, spin!Super Fantastic Death Ray 3-Ax[CR]OMAR's scientists spared no expense when creating weaponry for the ultimate assassin. This blue laser will cut through anything and keep on going. It can knock power-ups off enemies' cars!Scatter Missiles[CR]A rack of three cruise missiles retrofitted by Loki with cluster-bomb warheads.Bad Day In L.A.[CR]Molo won't say what he put into this old junkyard muffler, but he believes it's his best prank yet. It produces fumes so dense, they plug up most engines for good.Breath of Fire[CR]When Sid wanted a rapid-fire molotov launcher for his Manta, he had one made to order by the OMAR boys. A direct hit will set enemy cars ablaze![CR]Banned Vigilante 8 N64 Commercial[CR]Upon release in North America a commercial was released for the game which showed a school bus dropping kids off at school and driving away, after cutting into gameplay the bus would later return to pick the kids up after school but was destroyed. The reason behind it being banned was due to its violent content and was pulled after the Columbine High School Massacre.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Vigilantes had defeated Sidburn and his Coyotes after the events of the first game. Sadly, one of the heroic Vigilantes, Slick Clyde, rises as the leader of the OMAR oil conglomerate in the far future. Sidburn's rogue gunnrunners may have failed to capture the United States for their Oil conglomerate, but Slick Clyde decides to use the power of time travel to go back to the 1970s and try again to recapture the United States. Clyde travels back with the cybernetic hitman Dallas 13 and the silent assassin Obake to kill Convoy and take over America.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As in the previous game 2nd Offense is a car combat game. Each vehicle has a machine gun with unlimited ammo, and can also pick up more powerful limited use weapons like missiles and mines from pickups throughout the level. Each weapon pickup has a normal firing mode, and two special firing modes that are activated by taping in specific directions before firing. For example, a missile can be ignited but not launched, turning it into a rocket-powered nitro. Each character also has a special weapon unique to their vehicle.[CR]A new addition to this sequel are vehicle traction replacements. By driving over a ski, aqua jet, or hover icon in a level a vehicle's tires will be replaced. Skis offer better traction over snow, aqua jets can drive over water without sinking, and the hover attachment enables a car to fly.[CR]Each stage in the game has a specific objective for each faction: a target must either be protected for the Vigilantes, destroyed for the Coyotes, or a non-destruction related objective must be met for the Drifters. Sometimes items must also be collected and delivered. As well all opponent vehicles must be destroyed. Almost every object in a level can either be destroyed or damaged by weapon's fire. Some will drop special weapons when broken, while others will change the level, such as the giant model doughnut on a cafe which will fall off and roll around the level after the cafe is destroyed, or bridges that collapse after being weakened.[CR]Destroyed vehicles drop upgrade points that increase a character's car's parameters; at 50 points in a stat the vehicle is upgraded with an accessory and at 100 in all four stats the vehicle is upgraded to a completely new design.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Coyotes:Dallas 13Nina LocoMoloLord Clyde (unlockable)Obake (unlockable)Boogie (unlockable)Vigilantes:SheilaJohn TorqueFlying All Star TrioHouston (unlockable)Convoy (unlockable)Dave's Cultsman (unlockable)Drifters:Garbage ManAstronaut Bob OR.

Meteors will occasionally fall from the sky, especially if the observatory is destroyed. An extra large meteor will sometimes fall into a crater, and if destroyed will unleash a giant ant.Winter Games, Utah[CR]A mountain ski resort, complete with slalom, long jump, and half pipe. Cars can also ride the ski lifts.Ghastly Bayou, Louisiana[CR]A remote swamp location complete with abandoned plantation house, graveyard, and levy. Ghosts will attack nearby cars if their tombstones or crypts are destroyed, and the entire level will flood if the levy is opened.Launch Site, Florida[CR]An island launch pad for the space shuttle. Players can manually launch the space shuttle, or even launch themselves by driving around the tower's rear. On their return to earth they can pick up floating health and weapons in the sky. Highly explosive fuel containers are located throughout the island, and hungry sharks swim around the island's edges.Steel Mill, Pennsylvania[CR]The steel mill has a train that circles around the level endlessly. The train can be destroyed, or will crash itself if it run into a destroyed bridge. If parts of the mill are broken they will leak liquid metal on to cars passing nearby.Nuclear Plant, Minnesota[CR]This plant consists of two reactors and a field of generators, turbines, and transformers. If a reactor is shot is will go critical and detonate, dealing massive damage to any nearby vehicles. The turbines and transformers are also dangerous, capable of shocking any nearby cars if they're charged up.Alaskan Pipeline, Alaska[CR]An oil drilling and refining plant. The pipeline acts as quick transportation for cars, sucking them in and depositing them elsewhere in the level. Pools of crude oil will also slow down any vehicle that drives into them, and can be ignited with special weapons.Pacific Harbor, California[CR]A major shipping location with cranes and sea access. A massive bridge runs the length of the level, and, of course, can be destroyed.Old Levels:[CR]All the levels from the first Vigilante 8 game can be played on the PS1 and DC versions of the game. On the PS1 the V8 disc must be hotswapped into the system while the game is paused. The disc will be read, the game will notify the player that the old levels have been unlocked, and the V8:2O disc will then need to be replaced. On the DC the code OLD_LEVELS only has to be entered.Secret Base, NevadaSand Factory, UtahOil Fields, New MexicoAircraft Graveyard, ArizonaGhost Town, New MexicoHoover Dam, Arizona/NevadaValley Farms, CaliforniaCasino City, NevadaCanyon Lands, UtahSki Resort, Colorado[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Select Options, make sure the cursor is on Game Status, then press A twice.

		<plot>Only evil this dark could bring him back. Only a game this big can do him justice. Turok 2: Seeds of Evil! Pick off distant enemies with deadly sniper weapons, and enjoy ferocious multi-player deathmatches![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Enter these codes at the Cheat Menu option:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility Glitch[CR]If you are taken to zero health (death) as you fall into a save point, you will be able to exit the save point completely invincible. Your health will still be at zero, and the glitch will wear off if regenerate any health. As long as you keep your health at zero, you can stay invincible forever.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Deathmatches in Solo Mode[CR]This reportedly works on black cartridges only. [CR]Enter the master cheat ''BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND'' and go to a deathmatch. Select options, level, and characters as normal. Enter the match. Now go to the ''Warp'' cheats and select any level to warp to. Select it TWICE, because it won't send you there the first time. [CR]You are now in a single player level with all your multiplayer options and players! up to 4 can join the fun, but it lags badly unless you only have 2 players.Warps do not work and you cannot pick up the single player items. [CR]Try this on level 2, and with other cheats on [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] No Damage From Undead In River of Souls.[CR]In level 2, one of the most annoying enemies in the entire game pops up in the graveyard and soul gate sections -- undead. They swarm you and attack by throwing blood at you, which can drastically mess with the game's shoddy frame rate and really mess you up, and even kill you despite the small damage.There's a simple trick to get around this, though. Just turn the blood off in the options menu, and presto! The undead animation to throw blood at you still happens, but since the blood is turned off they won't actually throw anything at you. Now the undead go from one of the most annoying enemies to the easiest, and the best part of all is this doesn't mess with the game's true ending trigger. If you use cheats to clear Turok 2, the game doesn't give you the true ending. But apparently, messing up swarms of enemies by turning the blood off is a-okay.</plot>

Three levels of difficulty: Amateur, Professional and Championship. Master trick shots, learn a new game or challenge hundreds of computer opponents in exciting tournament play.[CR]Virtual Pool 64 is a 3D, first-person sports simulation video game that was developed by Celeris and released for the Nintendo 64 by Crave Entertainment on December 17, 1998, solely in North America.[1] The game features computer simulations of 11 forms of pool (pocket billiards). It is part of the "Virtual Pool" game franchise, which also includes the PC games Virtual Pool, Virtual Pool 2, Virtual Pool Hall and Virtual Pool 3.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The coveted breast grab[CR]War gods is a fighting game released by Midway that resembles Mortal Kombat in almost every way. The game featured a few playable characters, high quality audio (at the time of release) and a strange use of human modelling in the graphical process. There were very few options available to the player who could simply choose 'Start Game' to begin play. The game received many negative reviews largely on account of it being nothing more than an inferior Mortal Kombat clone.[CR]Graphic Design[CR]It could be argued that War Gods was essentially a tech demo for Midway that promoted an technology that they had been developing. A way of pasting photos of real people onto an in-game 3D model. While this idea appeared to work on paper utilizing it effectively proved to be difficult and resulted in some odd graphics that occasionally did not work. The games poor reception and low sales meant that Activision did not continue on developing either the franchise or technology.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The inspiration for the movie 'Gladiator'[CR]As stated before the game is extremely similar to Mortal Kombat, so much so that all the move sets and combos have almost been lifted from that franchise into this game. Players are given a soft and hard punch as well as a low and high kick. These can be stringed together with some careful twisting of the control stick to preform simple attacks, combos and fatalities. Unlike Mortal Kombat, War Gods takes place in a 3D environment where the player can side step to avoid enemies attacks. This being the case projectile weapons are heavily utilised in this game. The game is extremely limited in terms of the match customization. In fact the player is only given one option and that is 'Start Game'. Once that has been selected they are taken to a character selection screen before the first match commences. The player then has to fight their way though all the other characters of the game, again much like Mortal Kombat, before facing off in what is essentially a boss character. At any stage a second player could press start on the second controller and take over for the AI.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The games story-line was really nothing more than a quick justification as to why these characters existed and what they were all fighting each other for. The story did not really enter into the game at all past the short paragraph found on the back of the box and in the instruction booklet . The premise involved an ancient starship that was transporting a special 'ore' crashed due to Earth's atmosphere where it was found by ten humans who were transformed into immortals by its power. These ten gods then wage a personal war against each other to find all the remaining ore on Earth, hence the fighting and title of the game.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The following character biographies are taken from the games instruction booklet. Ahua Kin[CR]In a vision, Ahua Kin, an evil high priest, learned that untold power lay at the bottom of his tribe's sacrificial well. One by one, he sent his slaves to their death diving to reach The Ore. Finally, overwhelmed with desire, he plunged to the well's depths and retrieved The Ore.Anubis[CR]While searching for lost treasure in the Valley of the Kings, a grave robber uncovered a hidden burial chamber. The thief tried to steal its treasures, unaware that The Ore had been placed in the chamber to destroy anyone who entered. His body was destroyed by The Ore, but his soul is cursed to return as Anubis.CY-5[CR]The power of The Ore is timeless. In the year 2096, scientists will implant The Ore into CY-5, an advanced cyborg, unaware that The Ore has life-giving power. CY-5 will kill the scientists. It will conclude that more Ore is needed for greater human consciousness. CY-5 will fight in a ruthless systematicAnubis, Egyptian god and graverobber[CR]manner to achieve its goal...Kabuki Jo[CR]A feared medieval samurai discovered The Ore on the eve of a great battle. Overwhelmed by its power, he slaughtered his men in a rage of fire and fury. Shamed by the destruction he had caused, he became Kabuki Jo, an outcast determined to master the power that consumes him.Maximus[CR]Maximus, a mighty gladiator, fought for the entertainment of his masters. During a great festival that celebrated The Ore, he battled to determine which of his masters would possess it. He killed his opponent, but slaughtered his masters as well. He took The Ore and escaped. Consumed by its power, he fights for all who have been enslaved.Pagan[CR]Ancient manuscripts revealed the location of The Ore to Pagan, a mistress of the black arts. She arrived at the ruins of a cathedral where The Ore was once worshipped. Pagan summoned forth the hidden Ore by reciting the manuscript's incantations. The Ore increased her hunger for power and destruction. She will destroy anyone who stands in her way.Tak[CR]Thousands of years ago, a kingdom worshiped The Ore as a god. A rival kingdom declared war to capture The Ore. In the face of defeat, the king hid The Ore in a stone idol. The idol came to life as Tak, avenger of a lost civilization.War gods...some of them are just plain stupidVallah[CR]Vallah, a warrior princess, became separated from battle during a great ice storm. Taking shelter in a nearby cave, she saw a glowing green light trapped inside a translucent wall of ice. Hacking away at the ice, her sword finally made contact with The Ore. Vallah was transformed into a Viking goddess, and rules the realm of ice.Voodoo[CR]In a Caribbean village, a witch doctor enslaved his people with black magic and arcane spells. One night in desperation, the villagers captured the witch doctor and burnt him to death. They threw his body into a forbidden swamp, unaware that it hid a deposit of The Ore. The ore's energy brought his corpse back to life as Voodoo, god of the undead.Warhead[CR]Government officials were worried than an experiment to merge nuclear weapons with The Ore was in jeopardy. They sent their top operative to investigate. When he arrived at the research center, the building exploded, covering his body with fragments of The Ore. The soldier was transformed into warhead, a super-human fighter.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the Title Screen press Right, Right, Right, B, B, A, A to unlock the Cheat Menu.</plot>

		<title_clean>Wave Race 64</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wave Race 64 was one of           Nintendo's earliest titles for the          Nintendo 64 console.  The game is centered around         jet ski racing in fictional track environments in both straight races and stunt challenges.  It is a pseudo-sequel to the original        Wave Race that appeared on the       Game Boy, and was followed by      Wave Race: Blue Storm on the     GameCube. Wave Race 64 garnered praise for its realistic water physics, which have a large effect on the handling of the jet skis. Players could use waves as launch platforms to reach certain short cuts, or perform tricks off of waves.[CR]Rules[CR]The race events of Wave Race 64 are standard races tp the finish line against three opponents, with a twist. The player has to maneuver their jet ski past buoys, passing each buoy on alternating sides. Passing buoys on the the appropriate side in succession will grant power boosts, increasing speed, but missing one will result in a power-down. The player will earn points at the end of each race dependent on their finishing position, and the racer with the most points at the end of the tournament wins. The stunt events take place on the same tracks as the races, but this time the only goal is to score as many points as possible by doing tricks off of ramps and going through rings.[CR]Characters  [CR]The game contained only four selectable characters who each had their own jet ski. There were a few limited costumes for each character and players were able to customize the Jet Ski so that they would handle better or have improved acceleration.[CR]Tracks  [CR]The game only comes with 9 tracks most with a tropical island theme they are still quite different from each other and each evoke a different feel. For each track the wave setting allowed you to set how frequent and big the waves were. This could drastically change the difficulty of a course and also allowed for more stunts. A mirrored version of each track could also be unlocked  Dolphin Park  The games warm up level set in a very calm tropical island setting. If you follow the tutorial instructions you will follow a dolphin that swims around the area Sunny Beach   A very basic course in shape with small waves and once again set in a similar topical island setting like Dolphin ParkSunset Bay  A track that is similar to Sunny beach but takes place during sunset. The waves are slightly more powerful here.Drake Lake  This track has some very heavy mist spread throughout the track. It is the first track to not have a tropical water theme to it. Waters are very calm due to it being a lake however it can be east to bank your jet ski on barges.  Marine Fortress  Set on outside a military base during a thunderstorm this track has huge waves that can throw the player off course.Sunset Bay  Port Blue  Similar to Sunny beach in shape without the tropical feel to it.  Twilight City  A fictional city that it is very similar to a water surrounded Vegas. Glacier Coast  Regarded as a hard track due to its strong waves and high amount of obstacles on the course such as submerged icebergs. Southern Island  This level is interesting in that the water level drops each lap which changes how the player has to deal with the different obstacles on the track.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Championship  In this mode the player races on a set of courses against three other computer controlled racers. At the end of the race points are given to each player depending on where they placed during the race and then tallied. If the player did not get enough points it would be game over. Warm Up  The warm up mode was the games tutorial mode that familiarized the player with how to control their jet ski. While there were objectives in this level they were optional and players were free to explore at their own leisure. Time Trial  The player has to race against the clock in order to finish with the quickest possible time.Stunt Mode  The player races on the course driving through colored rings and attempting to preform stunts using ramps and natural waves. 2P VS  The game only allowed for two players to race at the same time. This is  probably due to low frame rates if the game had to account for 4 individual player screens. [CR]Wii Virtual Console  [CR]Wave Race 64 was re-released for                 Nintendo Wii's (American)                Virtual Console on  Aug 6 2007. It received some press for this as Nintendo were forced to remove all references to Kawasaki heavy industries, including advertising banners and jet skis within the game. Instead of the Kawasaki adverts various Nintendo adverts were implemented instead. The Jet ski's themselves were barely changed other than removing the logo from them.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dolphin Intro[CR]Once you have unlocked the dolphin for warm ups, the intro will rotate between players riding on dolphins and players riding on jetskis![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Big Scores[CR]In trick mode in any level you perform a simple move such as a flip.Before the commantor will say something you pause the game and listen to what he saids. Then unpause the game and don't do another trick for the rest of the level.  If your successful when you unpause the game you won't see how many points you get for your move,and when you  cross the finish line at the end then you shall see how many points you get.(Hint: try to take your time before finishing)</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wave Race 64 was one of           Nintendo's earliest titles for the          Nintendo 64 console.  The game is centered around         jet ski racing in fictional track environments in both straight races and stunt challenges.  It is a pseudo-sequel to the original        Wave Race that appeared on the       Game Boy, and was followed by      Wave Race: Blue Storm on the     GameCube. Wave Race 64 garnered praise for its realistic water physics, which have a large effect on the handling of the jet skis. Players could use waves as launch platforms to reach certain short cuts, or perform tricks off of waves.[CR]Rules[CR]The race events of Wave Race 64 are standard races tp the finish line against three opponents, with a twist. The player has to maneuver their jet ski past buoys, passing each buoy on alternating sides. Passing buoys on the the appropriate side in succession will grant power boosts, increasing speed, but missing one will result in a power-down. The player will earn points at the end of each race dependent on their finishing position, and the racer with the most points at the end of the tournament wins. The stunt events take place on the same tracks as the races, but this time the only goal is to score as many points as possible by doing tricks off of ramps and going through rings.[CR]Characters  [CR]The game contained only four selectable characters who each had their own jet ski. There were a few limited costumes for each character and players were able to customize the Jet Ski so that they would handle better or have improved acceleration.[CR]Tracks  [CR]The game only comes with 9 tracks most with a tropical island theme they are still quite different from each other and each evoke a different feel. For each track the wave setting allowed you to set how frequent and big the waves were. This could drastically change the difficulty of a course and also allowed for more stunts. A mirrored version of each track could also be unlocked  Dolphin Park  The games warm up level set in a very calm tropical island setting. If you follow the tutorial instructions you will follow a dolphin that swims around the area Sunny Beach   A very basic course in shape with small waves and once again set in a similar topical island setting like Dolphin ParkSunset Bay  A track that is similar to Sunny beach but takes place during sunset. The waves are slightly more powerful here.Drake Lake  This track has some very heavy mist spread throughout the track. It is the first track to not have a tropical water theme to it. Waters are very calm due to it being a lake however it can be east to bank your jet ski on barges.  Marine Fortress  Set on outside a military base during a thunderstorm this track has huge waves that can throw the player off course.Sunset Bay  Port Blue  Similar to Sunny beach in shape without the tropical feel to it.  Twilight City  A fictional city that it is very similar to a water surrounded Vegas. Glacier Coast  Regarded as a hard track due to its strong waves and high amount of obstacles on the course such as submerged icebergs. Southern Island  This level is interesting in that the water level drops each lap which changes how the player has to deal with the different obstacles on the track.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Championship  In this mode the player races on a set of courses against three other computer controlled racers. At the end of the race points are given to each player depending on where they placed during the race and then tallied. If the player did not get enough points it would be game over. Warm Up  The warm up mode was the games tutorial mode that familiarized the player with how to control their jet ski. While there were objectives in this level they were optional and players were free to explore at their own leisure. Time Trial  The player has to race against the clock in order to finish with the quickest possible time.Stunt Mode  The player races on the course driving through colored rings and attempting to preform stunts using ramps and natural waves. 2P VS  The game only allowed for two players to race at the same time. This is  probably due to low frame rates if the game had to account for 4 individual player screens. [CR]Wii Virtual Console  [CR]Wave Race 64 was re-released for                 Nintendo Wii's (American)                Virtual Console on  Aug 6 2007. It received some press for this as Nintendo were forced to remove all references to Kawasaki heavy industries, including advertising banners and jet skis within the game. Instead of the Kawasaki adverts various Nintendo adverts were implemented instead. The Jet ski's themselves were barely changed other than removing the logo from them.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Description[CR]Take on "The Great One" again in this hot sequel to the smash hit voted "Best Sports Game" of '96! With more great features, such as new hidden teams and improved, hard-hitting AI, Gretzky '98 packs a wallop! Includes all 26 teams, each with 17 available players on their actual NHL teams, and you can make player trades or line manipulations to create a powerhouse team of your own. Play 3-on-3, 4-on-4 or 5-on-5 games on either arcade or regulation size hockey rinks, plus exhibition games, full 82 game seasons or a best-of-seven playoff series with full statistic saving capability.[CR][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of two basic options: Arcade and Simulation. Although the graphics and earlobe vary little between the two, other changes have the effect of changing the chemistry and intensity of gameplay between the two options. The gamer has the ability to customize period length, fatigue (on/off), line changes, fighting (on/off), penalties (simulation only), rink size (arcade only), puck-streak (on/off), and camera angle.[CR]    * Simulation Mode[CR]Simulation mode is designed to emulate the real game of hockey. Players may play five, four, or three to a side, depending on preference. Recognition of penalties, off-sides, and icing are all optional, but two-line pass is not considered. Period length can be selected between 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.[CR]    * Arcade Mode[CR]During the Arcade mode checking, hooking, and tripping are more violent. Fights occur with greater frequency, and penalties are disregarded entirely. Additionally, arcade mode sees the introduction of a "power shot", which a player may utilize to light the net on fire after a goal. Arcade mode tends to be more exciting.[CR][CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The game gained widespread criticism for several perceived shortcomings. The game was perceived to be crude and unfitting as a pure hockey simulator, leaving many enthusiasts disappointed, but many arcade fans delighted.[CR][CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/574500-wayne-gretzkys-3d-hockey-98[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky%27s_3D_Hockey_%2798[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Choose your opponent[CR]Highlight the team you want to play against and press C-Right, C-Right, C-Right. If done correctly, you'll hear a click.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Ad Trick[CR] At any non-gameplay menu, press Z to view an advertisement. Each time you press the Z button a different ad will appear.</plot>

Some of the options include: first blood, the person who cause the opponent to bleed first wins; human torch, the first to set their opponent on fire wins; and the option to have pins and submissions count, or not.[CR]Hardcore Challenge: This is the game's main mode, similar to an arcade mode seen in most fighting games. The idea is to battle your way to a championship title shot by fighting a different opponent per backstage area. Once everyone has been beaten, the title match is unlocked. The championship belt corresponds to the difficulty, Hardcore Championship being easiest, U.S Championship being normal, and the World Championship being the hardest. Throughout the mode, the player can complete certain requirements in a match to unlock additional wrestlers and moves. Completing each difficulty rewards the player with one of three unlockable backstage areas, The Block, The Media Center and The Parking Garage; the latter being the hardest to obtain. Once completed, the player's score -- which is shown at the end of every match courtesy of a score breakdown -- is entered into the "Hall of Champions". The player also recieves attribute points at the end of the Hardcore Challenge.[CR]Hardcore Gauntlet: Described in the game as "only for experts" the Hardcore Gauntlet is a more advanced survival mode, facing 7 opponents in succesion with little time for breathers, meaning no stamina is replenished, and no re-tries. Once defeated, the player has to start the whole thing all over again. Some of the better unlockables are obtained through the Hardcore Gauntlet. Speed and efficiency are the key to winning here.[CR]Commentary[CR]WCW Backstage assault features commentary from Tony Schioavone and Bobby "The Brain" Heenan. The lines of commentary are mostly taken from previous EA WCW games, with a handful of new lines to fit accordingly with the game's unique setting and location."Famous" Lines:[CR]"That could kill somebody!"[CR]"Swing! and a miss!"[CR]"How does he do"..."I don't know how he does it!"[CR]"Thank you for playing, WCW, Backstage Assault!"[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]At the time of release, our own Jeff Gerstmann, then at Gamespot, awarded the game a 5.1 citing a lack of variation as its downfall.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Enter at the main menu:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock La Parka[CR]In, Hardcore Challenge mode, knock out your opponent with a steel chair, in the Truck Arena. If done correctly, ''wrestler Unlocked'' will appear. This unlocks La Parka.</plot>

Mayhem was also the first wrestling game to have featured backstage venues and color commentary, which was rare for wrestling games at that time. During what lasted only 3 months, upcoming Pay-Per-View lineups could be recreated in game with codes given out on broadcasts of Monday Nitro.[CR]Roster[CR]Alex WrightArn AndersonBam Bam BigelowBarry WindhamBilly KidmanBobby BlazeBobby EatonBobby Duncam, Jr.Booker TBret HartBuff BagwellChavo Guerrero , Jr.Chris BenoitChris JerichoCurt HennigDean MalenkoDiamond Dallas PageDisco InfernoDoug DillingerEddie GuerreroEric BischoffErnest "The Cat" MillerBill Goldberg"Mean" Gene OkerlundHollywood Hulk HoganHorace HoganJimmy HartJuventud GuerreraKanyonKaz HayashiKenny KaosKevin NashKonnanLa ParkaLash LeRouxLex LugerLizmark, Jr.Macho Man Randy SavageNorman SmileyPerry SaturnPrince IaukeaPsychosisRavenRey Mysterio, Jr.Ric FlairRick SteinerScott HallScott NortonScott SteinerSergeant Buddy Lee ParkerSonny OnooSteve "Mongo" McMichealStevie RayStingWrath[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] PPV Passwords[CR]Enter at the Pay-Per-View Screen</plot>

		<title_clean>WCW vs. nWo - World Tour</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WCW vs. nWo: World Tour is the first in a line of wrestling games developed for the Nintendo 64 that was developed by AKI Corporation and published by THQ, it is the sequel to the PS-one game WCW vs the World, and the sequel WCW/nWo Revenge was the second and last WCW game for the Nintendo 64, followed by WWF WrestleMania 2000 once the WWF license had expired from Acclaim, and finally WWF No Mercy. Each game shows a huge progression from the last, and probably makes the Nintendo 64 the console of choice for any wrestling fan of the era, and still considered by many as the best era in wrestling games and wrestling too, the &#8220;Attitude&#8221; Era.[CR]AKI also developed two games in Japan Virtual Pro Wrestling 64 and Virtual Pro Wrestling 2.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]WCW VS nWo - 5 vs. 5 Elimination style match pitting only WCW vs. nWoExhibition - Featuring 1 vs. 1, 2 vs 2 Tag Team match, 2 vs. 1 Handicap Match and Battle Royal 4 player elimination matchLeague Challenge - Main single player mode where player competes against all wrestlers from the four Promotions to unlock hidden leagues and wrestlersLeague - Round Robin style league for for up to eight singles wrestlers or Tag Teams to compete against each other inTournament - Knock out tournament for up to eight singles wrestlers or Tag Teams[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]WCW vs. nWo has a very simple combat system, based on the Fire Pro Wrestling series. Grapple moves are performed by using a strong or light grapple, performed by holding down the A button or tapping it. Also, a strong or light strike can be performed by holding the B button down or tapping it.[CR]Once in a grapple, a move can be executed by pressing the A or B buttons, either with the D-pad in the neutral position or a combination of up and down being pressed, offering a wide variety of moves that could be executed.[CR]Also in a grapple, the opponent can be "whipped" towards the ropes or turnbuckle using the Left-C button. Upon bouncing off the ropes and returning to the player, either variant of the grapple or strike could be executed. In the turnbuckle, much like with standard grapples, up and down on the D-pad with a press of either A or B will execute different maneuvers.[CR]Players can run using the left-C button and perform a running strike by pressing the B button. Also running into the turnbuckle will cause your wrestler to climb up it and releasing the button would perform a diving attack, depending on the position of your opponent and if they were standing or lying. With certain wrestlers it is also possible to dive out of the ring by pressing A at the correct time while running at the ropes as your opponent is outside.[CR]Taunting was also controlled by the use of the analog stick by pushing it in any direction, allowing you to raise your spirit meter. Once raising the meter to maximum it flashes with the word SPECIAL, giving you a limited time to perform the wrestlers special attack, which is often the wrestler's signature finishing maneuver. This is done by a strong grapple either from the front or rear of the opponent and tapping a direction of the analog stick.[CR]Over the course of the game series AKI further refined the control scheme, improving it with each passing game and offering a wider range of moves and ways that can be done by the time they finally released WWF No Mercy.[CR]Roster[CR]There are 42 wrestlers to select from in the character select screen, but about only half of the roster were based on their WCW-contracted counterparts. The developers of AKI employed various facsimiles of Japanese wrestlers--to waive copyrights and licensing--of their concurrently developed Virtual Pro Wrestling 64 into the roster of WCW vs. nWo to add depth to the roster tally, even if it was at a superficial level. The factions of Dead or Alive and the Independent Union are fictional composites of the Japanese promotions Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and Michinoku Pro. At an initial glance, it is quite an impressive roster. However, when compared to VPW 64, it becomes plain to see that WCW vs. nWo was given the short end by having dozens of wrestlers less than its Japanese analog. This matter can be assuaged by the assumption that most of its potential audience would have been confused by the inclusion of 80 odd ersatz Japanese wrestlers. At least WCW vs. nWo has the distinction of having "nWo Sting" (as a unique character), Glacier, Wrath, and the purely fictitious Joe Bruiser as exclusive members of its roster.[CR]The fictional characters and promotions created for this game are delineated by their real counterparts in parentheses.WCWChris BenoitRic FlairEddie GuerreroLex LugerDean MalenkoRick SteinerScott SteinerStingUltimo DragonRey Mysterio Jr.Steven RegalDiamond Dallas Page - HiddennWo"Hollywood" HoganScott HallKevin NashSyxxEric BischoffnWo StingBuff BagwellScott Norton"Macho Man" Randy Savage - HiddenDOA (FMW)Sumo Jo (Genichiro Tenryu)Kim Chee (Koji Kitao)Blackheart (Tarzan Goto)Puchteca (Atsushi Onita)Hannibal (Hayabusa)Powder Keg (Terry "Bamm Bamm" Gordy)Dim Sum (Gedo)Saladin (Abdullah the Butcher)Ali Baba (The Original Sheik)Wrath - HiddenIndependent Union (Michinoku Pro)Black Ninja (The Great Sasuke)Shaolin (Jinsei "Hakushi" Shinzaki)The Unknown (Super Delfin)The Claw (Gran Naniwa)Black Belt (TAKA Michinoku)PacoLoco (Dick Togo and "Terry Boy" Men's Teioh)Shaman (Wellington Williams Jr.)Master Fuji (El Gran Hamada)Glacier - HiddenWhole World WrestlingJoe Bruiser - HiddenBlack Widow - Hidden (Manami Toyota)[CR]Awards[CR]D.I.C.E.

At least WCW vs. nWo has the distinction of having "nWo Sting" (as a unique character), Glacier, Wrath, and the purely fictitious Joe Bruiser as exclusive members of its roster.[CR]The fictional characters and promotions created for this game are delineated by their real counterparts in parentheses.WCWChris BenoitRic FlairEddie GuerreroLex LugerDean MalenkoRick SteinerScott SteinerStingUltimo DragonRey Mysterio Jr.Steven RegalDiamond Dallas Page - HiddennWo"Hollywood" HoganScott HallKevin NashSyxxEric BischoffnWo StingBuff BagwellScott Norton"Macho Man" Randy Savage - HiddenDOA (FMW)Sumo Jo (Genichiro Tenryu)Kim Chee (Koji Kitao)Blackheart (Tarzan Goto)Puchteca (Atsushi Onita)Hannibal (Hayabusa)Powder Keg (Terry "Bamm Bamm" Gordy)Dim Sum (Gedo)Saladin (Abdullah the Butcher)Ali Baba (The Original Sheik)Wrath - HiddenIndependent Union (Michinoku Pro)Black Ninja (The Great Sasuke)Shaolin (Jinsei "Hakushi" Shinzaki)The Unknown (Super Delfin)The Claw (Gran Naniwa)Black Belt (TAKA Michinoku)PacoLoco (Dick Togo and "Terry Boy" Men's Teioh)Shaman (Wellington Williams Jr.)Master Fuji (El Gran Hamada)Glacier - HiddenWhole World WrestlingJoe Bruiser - HiddenBlack Widow - Hidden (Manami Toyota)[CR]Awards[CR]D.I.C.E.

		<title_clean>WCW-nWo Revenge</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game would become THQ&#8217;s swan song for its WCW license on the N64. They produced 1 more WCW game for the PS1, before acquiring the WWE license. The game is regarded as one of the best wrestling games, and the best WCW wrestling game developed for any console, with the highest average rating of any WCW game on GameRankings. The gameplay accommodated very competitive multi-player, and captured the WCW atmosphere with great animations, presentation, and a huge roster.[CR]Differences From WCW vs. nWo: World Tour[CR]Revenge introduced many new features not included in it's predecessor WCW vs. nWo: World Tour. These features include: wrestler entrances, the ability to bring weapons into the ring, and instant replay. Other additions were new arenas based on the WCW's shows and pay-per-view events and the ability to edit the costumes and names of existing wrestlers. The game also introduced multiple Special moves.[CR]Several modes from WCW vs. nWo: World Tour don't return in WCW/nWo Revenge. These modes are: WCW vs. nWo, League Challenge, League, and Tournament.[CR]WCW vs. nWo was a series of elimination matches between a team of WCW wrestlers and members of the nWo. This feature would be excluded from the WWF AKI/Asmik Ace games as well, but would return in Virtual Pro Wrestling 2. In VPW2, you can choose any combination of wrestlers to be on each team; it's not specific to any faction like with the WCW and nWo.[CR]League mode allowed you to create a round robin tournament. You can choose up to 16 wrestlers, or 8 teams, to compete. This was another feature excluded from the WWF AKI/Asmik games, and would be seen again only in Virtual Pro Wrestling 2. Round robin tournaments are more popular in Japanese wrestling promotions, which is probably why they were left out of the later WWF wrestling games.[CR]League Challenge was similar to WCW/nWo Revenge's Championship mode, although each organization had their own singles and tag-team champion. WCW and DOA also had a Cruiserweight championship. In League challenge you competed against everyone within the organization before facing the champion, who was a hidden character. In WCW/nWo Revenge, the championship mode more accurately reflects the titles in WCW, with each belt having it's own path, and you face eight randomly chosen characters from the roster before facing the champion. The fictional promotions included in WCW/nWo Revenge do not have their own belts.[CR]Tournament mode was excluded from WCW/nWo Revenge, but would be featured in every other AKI/Asmik Ace wrestling game after. Single and Tag-Team elimination style tournaments in WCW were very rare, which could potentially be a reason why this mode was excluded for this game.[CR]In WCW vs. nWo World Tour a battle royal match was selectable in Exhibition mode, but limited to only four wrestlers. In WCW/nWo Revenge you could have up to 40 wrestlers compete, with new wrestlers entering once someone is eliminated.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like WCW vs. nWo: World Tour, the controls focus offensively on weak/strong attacks &amp; grapples. Defensively the game focused on the timing of blocking and evades. The Left button acted as evade, while the right button acted as block. If the player timed a block correctly, they could counter an enemies attack. For example, if Goldberg attempted a spear and the player blocked too early Goldberg would simply be unsuccessful. If timed perfectly, Goldberg would be caught in a submission. The gameplay was highly centered on balance. Opponent&#8217;s taunts and special moves could be used against them. By rotating the analog stick counter clockwise a taunt could be stolen. If an opponent had a devastating finishing move, it could be stolen by executing a successful grapple with the special meter flashing, and pressing A B at the same time.[CR]One major issue with the game once discovered was the analog break. If a player was caught in a submission or pin, they could repeatedly push the analog stick in a direction to break free. This rendered a pin or submission attempt virtually useless against other human players.[CR]Presentation[CR]How Many nWo members can Sting take out with his bat this match?[CR]The game really captured the WCW product presentation wise. Players contained signature entrances, and taunts. Wrestlers had multiple special moves, and many signature holds. The game included the Nitro arena, along with more popular PPV themes like Starrcade.Arenas[CR]The major difference between each arena is the entrance design. The logo for each arena appears in every ring except for Monday Nitro and Superbrawl. The color of the ring ropes and turnbuckles are the same for each arena. Listed below are the arenas you can choose in game, and the actual WCW events they were modeled after.Monday NitroSouled Out (Souled Out '98 - Hara Arena - Dayton, OH)SuperBrawl (SuperBrawl VIII - Cow Palace - San Francisco, California)Bash at the Beach (Bash at the Beach '97 - Ocean Center - Daytona Beach, Florida)Halloween Havoc (Halloween Havoc '97 - MGM Grand Garden Arena - paradise, Nevada)Starrcade (Starrcade '97 - MCI Center - Washington, D.C.)Weapons ListChainSuit caseBlack bat ( Sting Trademark)Silver batTrophyMicrophoneStop signTrash canChair ( La Parka Trademark)Broken Table Fragment[CR]Roster[CR]The roster is split up between WCW wrestlers, the two factions of nWo, and the Raven's Flock stable. Wrestlers that are unlocked in Championship mode have an asterisk next to their name. EWF and DAW, two fictional wrestling promotions in the game, feature characters whose individual movesets are based on real life Japanese wrestlers. The changes in appearance and name for these characters is due to copyright. The wrestlers they are based on are listed in parenthesis.nWo WhiteHollywood HoganGiantBrian AdamsScott HallScott NortonBuff BagwellEric BishoffScott SteinerCurt Hennig*nWo RedKevin NashStingLex LugerMacho Man Randy SavageKonnanRaven's FlockRavenLodiRiggsSick BoyReeseKidman*WCW 1Roddy Piper*Diamond Dallas PageGoldbergBret HartChris BenoitRick SteinerFit FinleyBooker TWCW 2SaturnDisco InfernoJim NeidhartBritish BulldogGlacierMeng*Van HammerKanyon*WCW 3Yugi NagataLarry ZbyskoBarbarian*La ParkaStevie RayWCW 4Chris JerichoEddie GuerreroPsychosisRey Mysterio Jr.Dean MalenkoJuventud GuerreraUltimo DragonChavo Guerrero Jr.Alex WrightEWFAKI Man/THQ ManShogun (Toshiaki Kawada)Executioner (Kenta Kobashi)Dr. Frank (Jumbo Tsurata)Jekel (Dr. Death Steve Williams)Maya Inca Boy (Akira Taue)DAWHawk Hana (Genichiro Tenryu)Kim Chee (Koji Kitao)Dake Ken (Atsushi Onita)Brickowski (Mil Mascaras)Ming Chee (Tarzan Goto)Han Zo Man (Hayabusa)Managers[CR]When playing a singles match in exhibition mode, certain wrestlers are accompanied to the ring by a manager not present in the main roster, and can only be seen during this time. If you press Z on a controller plugged into the 3rd or 4th controller slot, you can control them for the duration of the match.Jimmy Hart (accompanies Meng &amp; Barbarian)Kimberly Page (accompanies Diamond Dallas Page)Miss Elizabeth (accompanies Eric Bishoff &amp; Macho Man Randy Savage)Vincent (accompanies Scott Norton, Scott Steiner, &amp; Brian Adams)Rick Rude (accompanies Curt Hennig)Dusty Rhodes (accompanies Scott Hall)Sonny Onoo (accompanies Yuji Nagata)[CR]Historical Context[CR]WCW/nWo Revenge was released almost 11 months after WCW vs. nWo World Tour. During this time, the nWo had split into two factions: nWo Hollywood and nWo Wolfpac. This storyline is referenced during the game's intro and the grouping of the nWo members in separate rosters.[CR]Raven's Flock also has their own separate roster listing, although the group disbanded almost a month prior to the game's release, when Perry Saturn defeated Raven at the Fall Brawl PPV, freeing himself and the rest of the flock from Raven's control.[CR]Having appeared in WCW vs. nWo World Tour, Ric Flair is absent form the roster of WCW/nWo Revenge, most likely due to a lawsuit he was in with Eric Bishoff at the time. His absence from WCW began in April of 1998, and lasted until September that year, a month before the game's release.[CR]Kanyon is unlocked by defeating him for the TV title. Kanyon never was TV title champion during his time at WCW.[CR]Chris Jericho was the TV Title champion during the game's release.[CR]Meng &amp; Barbarian are unlocked by defeating them for the Tag Team title. They never held the WCW Tag Team championship during their time at WCW.[CR]The Tag Team title changed hands the day before the game's release, at the Halloween Havoc PPV on October 25, 1998. Up until the PPV, The Giant and Scott Hall were Tag Team Champions, representing nWo Hollywood. The titles were defended by The Giant and Scott Steiner on Halloween Havoc, invoking a variation of the Freebird Rules called nWo Rules, in which any duo of the nWo can defend the Tag Team championship. They faced Rick Steiner, who was feuding with his brother Scott, and Buff Bagwell, his first match back from an injury and supposedly no longer a member of the nWo. During the match Buff Bagwell turned on Rick, leaving him to face The Giant and Scott Steiner alone. Rick Steiner would endure long enough to win the match, after The Giant attempted to hit Rick with a missile dropkick from the top rope, and hit Scott instead; allowing Rick to beat The Giant with a Steiner bulldog from the top rope. Rick Steiner would choose Kenny Kaos to be his new partner the next night, but Kaos isn't a playable character in WCW/nWo Revenge.[CR]Roddy Piper is unlocked by defeating him for the World Heavyweight title. Piper never was World Heavyweight champion during his time at WCW.[CR]Goldberg was the WCW World champion during the game's release.[CR]Billy Kidman was in his second reign as Cruiserweight champion during the game's release, the only hidden character who actually was champion at the time. Although Kidman was no longer a member of Raven's Flock when he became Cruiserweight champion.[CR]Curt Hennig is unlocked by defeating him for the U.S. Heavyweight title. Curt Hennig held the title once during his time at WCW, winning it on September 15, 1997 on Monday Night Nitro. The victory came two months before the release of WCW vs. nWo World Tour, but Hennig was not included as a character in that game.[CR]Diamond Dallas Page won the U.S. Heavyweight title the day WCW/nWo Revenge was released on an episode of Monday Night Nitro, by defeating Bret Hart.[CR]Criticisms[CR]The game was lacking in the sound department, largely in part to the restrictions of the N64 cartridge. The entrances consisted of a few possible midi sound clips. The game featured no match commentary, and no specific entrance themes.[CR]Collision detection remained an issue as in World tour. Though collision detection had been improved, many reviews claimed of issues with floating limbs, and bodies. The game was criticized as being too similar to World Tour.[CR]Awards[CR]D.I.C.E. Awards Console Fighting Game of the Year (1999)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden characters[CR]On the Wrestler Select screen, enter the following codes to play as hidden wrestlers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Curt Hennig[CR]Win the U.S. Championship mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Managers[CR] During a one-on-one exibition match, choose a wrestler who has a manager.

		<title_clean>Wetrix</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Board and Game Pieces[CR]A game of Wetrix is played on a flat, square 3D platform that occupies the majority of the screen. The player can use various game pieces to raise and lower the landscape to contain and control water on the board. The game pieces are as follows:Uppers[CR]Red, upwards facing arrows that raise the landscape by one level. They come in four standard shapes: a straight line, a T shape, an L shape and a square ring. These are one of, if not the most common piece in the game; and in most game modes, several of these will fall initially to let the player build a perimeter before any water or other pieces fall.Downers[CR]Green, downwards facing arrows that lower the landscape. They come in two standard shapes: a small square and a straight line. No matter how high the downer connects with land, it will lower the land to the lowest point that any part of the downer touches. As such, if a downer is placed on a completely flat surface, it will have no effect.Water Bubbles[CR]Bubbles of water that break open upon contact with any piece of land. They come in various sizes. When water spills out of the bubbles, it behaves like water, flowing across the ground and attempting to fill the shape of its container. If water leaks over the edge of the board, blue arrows will flash to indicate where the spillage is occurring.Fireballs[CR]Balls of fire that evaporate water, thaw ice and destroy land. They exist in only one form. When fireballs hit a body of water, they will continue moving to the ground, evaporating the water as they go. Depending on the land surrounding and underneath the water, some water may still remain. If a fireball hits dry land, it will explode, clearing the point of contact to the ground and creating a sloped crater around it. Fireballs will also thaw ice, though a second fireball will be needed to evaporate the water.Bombs[CR]Bombs, though not of the giant variety, that blow holes in the landscape. They exist in only one form. When a bomb hits land, no matter how high, it destroys the point of contact, leaving a hole in the land where it landed and slightly deformed terrain in the immediate surroundings. The hole can be expanded by downers and repaired by uppers. If a bomb is placed in an existing bomb hole, a re-bomb is triggered: three additional bombs are dropped on the field at random. If one of these bombs land in an existing bomb hole, another re-bomb is triggered.Lakes and The Drain[CR]Any body of water on the game board is counted as a lake. Even if the water has no walls around it and is flowing towards the perimeter, it is counted as a lake.[CR]On the right side of the screen is the Drain Meter, which represents how much water has flown off of the board. When the drain is nearly full, it will begin blinking to notify the player. When the drain fills completely, the game is over. The player can evaporate lakes to reduce the drain meterThe Earthquake Meter[CR]On the left side of the screen is the Earthquake Meter, which represents how much land has been added to the starting game board. As the land is raised, through action of the player or certain game modes, the Earthquake Meter fills; similarly, when the land is lowered, the meter empties.[CR]When the meter is nearly full, it will begin shaking violently, blinking and beeping to notify the player. If the Earthquake Meter fills completely, the board shakes, warping the landscape, and the meter resets. The game does not end if the Earthquake Meter fills, however an earthquake can often lead to a full drain; and if not, the player will be left in a position extremely difficult to recover from. In this way, the Earthquake Meter can be seen as a bigger danger than the Drain Meter.Levels, Smart Bombs, Ice Cubes and Mines[CR]As games progress, a timer in the upper-right corner of the screen will run. After a few minutes, a chime will play a couple of times and the game's level will increase. With each level increased the background and land change their colours and the speed at which pieces drop increases. The highest level in any game is level 10.Smart Bombs[CR]If the player has at least five lakes on the game board when a level up occurs in certain game modes, they will be rewarded with a smart bomb. When activated, a smart bomb resets the game board to a flat, empty state, empties the Drain Meter and Earthquake meter, and queues several uppers in the piece queue, similar to the beginning of the game. The score, level timer and current level are not reset, though, allowing the player to come back from a potential game over.Ice Cubes[CR]From level 2 onwards (excluding levels 4 and 8), ice cubes will periodically fall onto the largest body of water on the board. If the cube hits a body of water, it will freeze over. After a length of time, the ice will thaw and the water will flow freely again. If the ice hits dry land, however, the player will receive bonus points. The player can also use fireballs to thaw the ice instantly.Mines[CR]On levels 4, 8, 9 and 10, multiple mines will periodically fall into a single body of water. The mines float in the water for a short amount of time and are predominately harmless. They can be split up into separate lakes and forced onto dry ground without risk. However if the player evaporates a lake with mines in it, the mines will explode, stopping the evaporation and leaving holes akin to those made by bombs where the mines were.Scoring, Duckies and Rainbows[CR]More often than not, the objective in a game of Wetrix is to score as many points as possible. Points can be gained from dropping game pieces onto the board before they land on their own, letting ice land on dry land, repairing holes in the landscape and thawing ice. The main method of gaining points, however, is evaporating lakes.[CR]All scores in a game of Wetrix are calculated based on how well the player is doing in the current game. Base scores are initially multiplied by the number of lakes and the current level. From there, two different types of multiplier can increase scores dramatically.Rainbows[CR]If enough water is contained on the game board, a rainbow will form across the board. When the rainbow is active, all scores are multiplied by 10. Only one rainbow can be present on the game board at any one time.Rubber Duckies[CR]If any lake on the board has a water level reaching two layers of land deep, a rubber ducky will begin swimming in it. Only the depth of the lake is important; the lake can be as large or as small as is necessary. When a rubber ducky is on the board, all scores will be multiplied by two, stacking with each additional ducky that appears.[CR]For example, if a fireball evaporates a lake for what amounts to 10,000 points, a rainbow is active and there are four rubber duckies active, the score will be:[CR]10,000 - x10[CR]100,000 - x2[CR]200,000 - x2[CR]400,000 - x2[CR]800,000 - x2[CR]1,600,000Rankings and Tile Sets[CR]At the end of a game, the player is given a rank (beginner, ok, good, excellent, expert, super, master) based on either the score earned in that game, the playtime in that game or the level reached. If the player can earn a minimum rank across all modes that award ranks, the player is given alternate sets of game pieces.Tile Set 1[CR]The default tile set, available from the beginning of the game.Tile Set 2[CR]Awarded for a rank of "ok" across all game modes, this tile set replaces most uppers and downers. While the straight, I-shaped piece remains of both types, new pieces include triangular pieces, straight pieces of half the length as the I-shaped piece and a square upper, similar to the square ring piece, however with only a small hole in the centre.[CR]Additionally, the piece queue icon in the lower-right of the screen can be inaccurate, with pieces shown as downers in the piece queue appearing in the game as bombs.Tile Set 3[CR]Awarded for a rank of "expert" across all game modes.Tile Set 4[CR]Awarded for a rank of "super" across all game modes.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]There are several game modes in Wetrix.Classic Mode[CR]A no-frills game of Wetrix. The player starts at level 1 and plays to earn as many points as possible until the drain fills up. Smart bombs can be earned at level-ups. Ice cubes and mines appear normally.Pro Mode[CR]A much more challenging game of Wetrix. In Pro Mode, the game begins at level 5. Additionally, bombs fall in pairs. Despite this, the player is still playing to earn as many points as possible. Ice cubes and mines appear normally.Multiplay Mode[CR]A two player, split-screen game of Wetrix. Each player is given a game board of their own to play a game of Wetrix on. Whichever player's drain fills first loses. By evaporating water, each player can build up an attack meter across the bottom of their screen. Then, depending on how much power has been built up, players can either send ice cubes, water, an earthquake or bombs to affect the other player's game.Handicap Mode[CR]In Handicap games, special rules are in play that affect the board. With each level up, the rules will be reapplied.Ice Layer A/B[CR]The game begins with a layer of ice on the board. After a short amount of time, it will begin thawing. At level up, all water on the board is replaced with the ice layer.Raised Land A/B[CR]The Earthquake Meter is partially filled at the beginning of the game and cannot be lowered. At level up, the floor raises slightly.Random Land[CR]The game begins with various parts of the board raised to varying small degrees. At level up, the board partially resets; all pieces disappear and the land is reset, however the random areas of the land that are raised are determined by what areas of the board had pieces placed down before the level up.Random Holes[CR]The game begins with several bomb holes already in the board. At level up, all water disappears, a new set of bomb holes are placed in the ground and the player is given a set of uppers to repair them before more water returns.Half-Full Drain[CR]The drain begins half-filled at the start of the game. At level up, the drain will reset to its half-filled state, regardless of how much water was there before.Challenge Mode[CR]In Challenge games, the player is presented with highly demanding game scenarios, but is also given a rare "win" condition. High scores are generally much more difficult to attain in this mode than any other.1-Minute Challenge[CR]The game only lasts for one minute. However, the game begins at level 10.5-Minute Challenge[CR]The game only lasts for five minutes. However, the game begins at level 4.100-Piece Challenge[CR]Only 100 pieces fall before the game is over. However, the game begins at level 8.500-Piece Challenge[CR]500 pieces fall before the game is over. However, the game begins at level 4.Preset A/B[CR]The game begins at level 1 and proceeds like a normal game of Wetrix in Classic Mode. However, the pieces always fall according to a preset pattern. When the pattern is complete, the game ends.Practice Mode[CR]In Practice Mode, the player can choose between playing a practice game of Wetrix or playing through one of eight tutorials.[CR]The practice game plays like a normal game of Wetrix, but removes the rain, levels (and, consequently, ice cubes and mines) and falling pieces. The player can still fill the drain and lose, but is given a more slower-paced environment to practice strategies.[CR]The tutorials teach the player basic game mechanics, preparing them for the first few levels of Classic Mode. The player can play the tutorials normally, or in a split-screen view, with a computer-controlled demo playing alongside them, showing a possible, if not recommended way to complete the tutorial.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Piece Sets[CR]Complete all 16 practice rounds. Enter the Options screen and there will be a new option called Floor. You can now choose different floor sets and backgrounds.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Waves[CR]Once you have the green background at the main menu, hold the C-up button to make a watersprout or C-down to make a vortex that can be controlled with the joystick.</plot>

		<plot>This game is an interactive version of the popular U.S. quiz show Wheel of Fortune complete with hostess Vanna White.[CR]The game is played by trying to find a hidden word with only a few guesses allowed for the letters which is very similar to the pen and paper game Hangman. The other round which features the Wheel of Fortune involves you spinning the wheel which has various prizes both good and bad and whatever the pointer stops on when it stops revolving is what the player wins. This can be cash, a free spin or if you're very unlucky Bankruptcy which means you lose all the money you've earned up to that point.[CR]Up to 3 Players can play together in multiplayer mode</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] World Cup 98 is the first FIFA game devloped by Electronic Arts based on the event. Electronic Arts bought the rights to use the FIFA name, teams and players. It is the first World Cup game played in 3D rather than a 2D perspective. The game also used the same graphics engine that was featured in the previously released FIFA Road to the World Cup.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Real teams and players were featured in the gameThe game contained many elements of the World Cup, and this adds realism to the game. Every player and team at the time is featured in the game with realistic stats. There are exhibition, World Cup, Road to the World Cup, tournament and multiplayer modes. You could also customize teams and players to create the team you want to use. The game can be played in many different perspectives. The camera can be moved to a traditional birds eye perspective or it could be zoomed in to show off the 3D graphics.  Shootout is an event that can break a tieYou will always be in control of the player who has the ball on offense. To defend you can cycle through players, but the game will often give you control to the proper man. Games will often end in draws, but you are able to choose sudden death or shoot out modes to break the tie. The game featured authenthic commentarry and licensed music. Real life announcers recorded a large amount of commentary to be used in the play by play of the game. Licensed music was usually featured throughout many of the game menus.  An interesting mode included in the game was Classic. In this mode you put in famous World Cup scenarios, and you are to meet requirements to beat it. There were many inconsistencies in the mode, but it did loosly follow the real life events.

		<title_clean>World Driver Championship</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Concept[CR]This game was the N64's closest competitor to Gran Turismo, and based its cars and teams heavily on real-life racing. Several cars are nearly direct ripoffs of real cars without the licensing. Starting out, you take the role of a new driver on the racing circuit looking for a break. You'll choose a team to drive for, and as you move up and win more races, faster cars will be offered to you by your team and others. Eventually, your goal is to be the world champion of sports car racing.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Far from an arcade racer, this game is as much a simulation as one could expect on the N64. The cars handle realistically, requiring careful driving to stay on the track and gain positions. Each car has its own characteristics, and the fastest cars actually seem to handle the best. There is no damage, but hitting walls or going through sand will slow you down significantly.[CR]Graphics[CR]The game does not use the Expansion Pak, but looks good even without it, especially in the high-quality letterbox mode. Cars look smooth and tracks are bright and colorful, with the exception of the night races, which can be a bit dark.[CR]Career Mode[CR]As you progress through the careeer mode, you need to win races and championships to advance. You can go back and do them over to get a better result. You start in the GT2 class, which consists mostly of highly modified road cars. As you increase your driver rank, you'll gain access to new cars and championships. When you complete the GT2 calendar, you'll graduate to GT1, driving full-on racing prototypes. Each time you win a Gold Cup, you earn 1 "restart" that you can use in future championship races if things are going badly.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The game offers 2-player splitscreen multiplayer, with an option for AI cars to fill out the field. You can also turn "catch-up" on or off, to aid a player who falls behind.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All GT2 Circuit Cars[CR]Go into championship mode, then go onto the screen that displays the teams, event select, save game and main menu optiions. Press Z, Right on the control pad, Z, Z, Z, Bottom C, A, Right on the control pad, Start, B, then A.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following names in Championship mode:</plot>

Can use this to hit worms who are in difficult places or behind cover.Homing Missile: A missile that homes onto enemies. Players select the area to be hit, then the power. The missile will automatically home in on this position.Homing Pigeon: Much like the Homing missile but does much more damage.Sheep Launcher: Launches an exploding sheep. They jump around before they explode; they do a maximum of 75 damage.Grenade: The power and length of fuse can be set to ensure maximum damage. Grenades tend to bounce around a lot and are useful for hitting worms hidden in holes.Cluster Bomb: Like the grenade but instead the bomb explodes into smaller cluster bombs which also explode. Only does 15 damage per cluster bomb and is well, pretty useless.Banana Bomb: One of the most powerful weapons in the game! The Banana Bomb is much like the Cluster bomb but it separates into 5 smaller banana bombs on contact. Each of these can do up too 100 damage.Earth Quake: Shakes the ground causing worms to fall off ledges and sometimes into the water.Fire Punch: A massive punch that and is useful for knocking worms off ledges or into explosive objects.Dragon Ball: Very similar to the fire punch but the worm launches it self towards the enemy and therefore does not have to be next to him to make it effective.Dynamite: One of the most likely the most used weapon and it's very simple: Just place the dynamite and run. Does a maximum of 75 damage.Mine: Places a mine on the ground which will be set off by any worm coming close to it. Can also be placed on top of worms to explode instantly (after a small countdown).Sheep: Lets loose a sheep which bounces along the land and can be exploded at any time.Super Sheep: Much like the normal sheep, however the super sheep can be controlled whilst in the air.Aqua Sheep: The same as the super sheep, except this can go underwater.Mortar: This has a huge range but is very inaccurate. Shoots a cluster bomb which explodes into further clusters of bombs doing a maximum of 15 damage each.Mole Bomb: Let loose a mole which borrows into the ground and can be detonated at any time. Useful at creating a quick shelter underground or to flush out worms already below ground.Mail Strike: Drops five letters onto enemies.Mole Squadron: A group of mole bombs dropped from the air, which behave like any other type of strike. However, they can be detonated at will.Blowtorch: Used to dig through the ground to create shelter. Can also be used to attack other worms at close range. Does a maximum of 35 Damage.Pneumatic Drill: Much like the blowtorch but can only dig vertically downwards.Girder: Creates a girder which will protect worms from incoming attack. Can also be used to reach inaccessible areas.Baseball Bat: Can knock worms off cliffs and does a maximum of 30 damage.Ninja Rope: A rope that can be used to swing along the landscape and reach inaccessible areas. Normally has unlimited uses and can be used to escape after a weapon has been places (mostly dynamite). Players can also drop weapons while using the ninja rope.Bungee: Used to bungee down the side of cliffs without taking any damage or ending the turn. Can be used for reaching inaccessible areas.Parachute: Can be used to jump large gaps in the terrain. Weapons can also be dropped while using a parachute. This is heavily affected by the wind.Teleport: Players select a location and then teleport there.Super Banana Bomb: Much like the banana bomb, but more powerful.Holy Hand Grenade: Much like the hand grenade, but does a huge amount of damage and can blow huge holes in the landscape.Flame Thrower: Shoots flames and does a maximum of 125 damage. The flame is affected by the wind.Salvation Army: Releases the forces of the salvation army (characters with drums). They move slowly along the ground and explode on their own after a while. Can also be detonated at will before this.Priceless Ming Vase: Places an ancient vase from the Ming Dynasty on the playing field which explodes.Petrol Bomb: Much like napalm, but on a much smaller scale. Once the petrol bomb explodes it releases fire, which burns the landscape and any worms present.Skunk: Releases a skunk. The skunk runs along the landscape and releases gas. This makes all worms in the area ill, causing them to lose health each turn.Scales of Justice: Redistributes the health of all worms on a team, making them all equal.Carpet Bomb: Releases carpets from the air which behave like any other air strike, but once they hit the ground, they can bounce and explode up to five times.Mad Cow: Launches a cow along the ground, which explodes after a certain amount of time. It does up to 50 damage.Old Woman: Players release and old woman that causes a maximum of 75 damage.Concrete Donkey: Drops a massive concrete donkey from the sky. Once it hits land, it stomps around destroying everything until it reaches the sea.Patsy's Magic Bullet: Fires a silver bullet that functions like the Homing Missile, however, its flight path is extremely accurate and much more sensitive to the contour of the terrain.Indian Nuclear Test: Causes the water to rise and makes everybody on the map sick, losing 2 health after each turn.Armageddon: Destroys nearly everything with a randomized meteorite strikes. Although extremely destructive, it is possible to survive this attack.[CR]</plot>

Taking a more complex route than the WCW world tour series. The control scheme mimicked more of a fighting game, rather than a traditional wrestling game. The game required a button sequence to pull off moves. For example: Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver required the following button sequence:Down, Up, Down, or Up, Down, Up (depending on location) + C Left on the Nintendo 64.[CR]Career Mode[CR]Using any wrestler from the roster you compete in 3 title runs, starting from the European title, Intercontinental title, and the WWF title, going through the list of wrestlers in various matches and different situations. After winning the title, you defend the title against the top 5 wrestlers. Also in the career mode, you can do a tag team career mode with a computer character. By completing the career mode, you can unlock more wrestlers and cheats, which can be accessed in the cheat menu option.[CR]Create a Wrestler[CR]The create a wrestler or C.A.W had a robust set of features. The player could choose from a wide range of options including : Gender, Attributes, Moveset, Entrances, and Taunts. Allowing the player to make their own creation, or closely replicate wrestlers not included in the original roster, or from other wrestling organizations. Many fan dedicated CAW sites developed on the internet with formulas for wrestlers, and fictional characters.[CR]Sound[CR]The game received positive response for its sound. The game featured specific crowd chants, commentary from Jerry Lawler, and Shane McMahon, and wrestler voices. In IGN's reviewthey claimed "The audio elements of Attitude are outstanding top to bottom. It's not necessarily the quality that got to us, but the variety of bits and depth of the samples that made us take notice."[CR]Playable Roster[CR]Al SnowBig Boss ManBilly GunnBradshawBrian ChristopherChristianD'Lo BrownDr. DeathDrozEdgeFaarooqGangrelThe GodfatherGoldustHeadbanger MoshHeadbanger ThrasherJeff JarrettKaneKen ShamrockMankindMark HenryOwen HartRoad DoggThe RockSteve AustinSteve BlackmanTriple HThe UndertakerVal VenisX-PacChyna (Secret Character)"Head" (Secret Character)Jacqueline (Secret Character)Jerry "The King" Lawler (Secret Character)Kurrgan (Secret Character)Marc Mero (Secret Character)Paul Bearer (Secret Character)Sable (Secret Character)Sgt.

		<title_clean>WWF No Mercy</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF No Mercy is a professional wrestling game created by Aki Corporation and published by THQ in November 2000. The game's title comes from the pay-per-view event of the same name, and is a follow-up to WWF WrestleMania 2000. While not a considerable commercial success, the game has been deemed one of the best wrestling games ever due to its in game mechanics as well as other features which had not been featured in a wrestling game before or again until late on in the SmackDown! series such as blood and branching storylines.[CR]One possible factor why it didnt become a great commercial success is the fact that the vast majority of copies had a massive memory glitch, causing save data to be deleted at any time. THQ did release a fixed version of the game almost a year later. This version, however, had blood removed even though all related animations and first blood matches remained unchanged. Unlike its predecesor, WWF No Mercy had new matchtypes, including ladder and cage matches. Furthermore with the use of Action replay, players could unlock a variety of different add ons, such as scaffold matches, but were notoriously bugged. More recently through emulators, wrestling fans have made a patch which includes more current wrestlers, from independent promotions, called ROH vs TNA.[CR]A sequel was announced in the form of WWF Backlash which only ever appeared in Nintendo Power, but it was cancelled due to support for the Nintendo 64 dropping near the end of its lifespan.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]Championship[CR]Rather than having a linear story to follow or simply a set of matches to beat before a title shot, WWF No Mercy had a different storyline for each of the available championships and each one of those modes featured different career paths depending on if you won or lost. For example, the Royal Rumble match in the WWF Championship mode has several different outcomes depending on where the player finished. This gave the player many story options while playing while also adapting the difficulty to allow for different skill levels. While the mechanics of the career mode were totally original, all the storylines featured were taken from episodes of RAW is WAR and SmackDown! such as the rivalry between Triple H and Mankind from 2000 or Crash Holly's 24/7 defence of the Hardcore Title. One significant difference however is that any storylines featuring the Big Show were recreated with Right to Censor era Steven Richards.[CR]In the career mode you play through a certain title you want (heavyweight, women's, tag team. etc.). What is new to this years game is the idea of branching campaigns. Depending on how you finish a match you could possible unlock a new level for a certain chapter of a belt. There are two ways to start a title, either as the defending champion or a new guy who will work his way on the Road to Wrestlemania. The game has lists of percentages based on how many of the possible levels you have unlocked for each belt. The many ways to finish a level aren't just limited to winning or losing but how you win or lose. One match In Tag Team has the objective of smashing Bubba Ray through the announcers table and then pinning him. The possibilities for ending this match are: smash him and pin, just pin, lose, lose after smashing him. This added a whole new depth to the career mode for much more replay value. For completing each level you earn money which can be used in the Smackdown mall. Another notable feature of the career mode is the ability to use a female character to win male championships, and vice versa. Allowing players to do such things as Triple H winning the Women's Championship.[CR] Survival[CR]Survival mode is a 100 wrestler Royal Rumble style elimination match. You can eliminate your opponents by knocking them out of the ring as well as pinfall, submission, or knockout.[CR]You earn money that can be spent in the Smackdown Mall for each elimination, and the amount you earn depends on how you defeated an opponent. You earn the least amount of money from knocking people out of the ring and you earn the most money from scoring pinfalls.[CR]Unlike the Royal Rumble, if you are eliminated the match ends, and you are shown the total amount of eliminations you had as well as the money you earned.[CR]If you manage to secure all 100 eliminations, you are rewarded a 1,000,000 dollar bonus, effectively allowing you to purchase everything in the Smackdown Mall at once.[CR]After every ten entrants, a hidden character will enter and if you eliminate them they will be available if you have not already unlocked them by other means. The last entrant in Survival mode will always be Andre The Giant.[CR]Match Types[CR]Singles MatchTag MatchTriple Threat MatchHandicap MatchCage MatchLadder MatchRoyal RumbleIronman MatchKing of the Ring[CR]All match types can have a variety of rules changed and tweaked allowing you to creat ner enough any match type you can come up with that is a variation of the ones above, from making a match falls count anywhere with no DQ's making it a hardcore match. Setting it to TKO only making it a Last Man Standing match, creating a four man Royal Rumble match with regular match rules turning it into a Fatal Four Way, Making it a First Blood match, or setting an Ironman Match to submission only turning it into an Ultimate Submission Match. Fancy a Hardcore Tag Team Tornado Match?

		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players choose a wrestler to compete in various types of matches, including: one-on-one, tag team, tornado tag, cage match, weapons match, and war. The Nintendo 64 version of the game also included Royal Rumble and gauntlet matches. Much like modern wrestling games, the player uses a combination of buttons to punch, kick, and grapple their opponents. Also, during some of the matches, you can set the mode to hardcore and use weapons which are available.[CR]Career Mode[CR]The single player "WWF Challenge" mode consists of a pyramid of television sets that the player starts at the bottom of. In each set is a different wrestler in the WWE, and as the pyramid goes higher, so does the difficulty of the matches. After the player has defeated his opponent, often that same opponent would issue a "grudge match." These "grudge match" challenges were not optional and were prefaced by a full-motion video of the challenger. After you win the WWF championship, you defend the title and, if you suffer a loss, you need to win the title again.[CR]The Game Boy version of the game features a password save system.[CR]Playable Rosters[CR]Nintendo 64 and Playstation VersionsAhmed Johnson Bret Hart British Bulldog Faarooq GoldustHeadbanger MoshHeadbanger Thrasher Kane Ken Shamrock Mankind Owen Hart The Rock Shawn Michaels Stone Cold Steve Austin Triple H The Undertaker Cactus Jack (Secret Character) Dude Love (Secret Character)Pamela (Secret Character)Rattlesnake (Secret Character)Sue (Secret Character)Trainer (Secret Character)Turok (Secret Character; can only be unlocked using a GameShark)[CR]Commentators Vince McMahon Jim RossGame Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of the game features a smaller roster than the console counterparts.Shawn MichaelsKaneKen Shamrock"Stone Cold" Steve AustinFaarooqGoldustTriple HMankindOwen HartThe RockThe British BulldogAhmed JohnsonThe Undertaker [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Players[CR]Go to the main menu and press C-Up, A, A, B, Z[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random Wrestler[CR]On the character selection screen, hold Up and press Block.</plot>

		<title_clean>WWF WrestleMania 2000</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]WWF WrestleMania 2000 used the AKI engine, previously seen in the studios prior wrestling games under the WCW brand ( WCW/nWo: World Tour and WCW/nWo Revenge) and as a result used many of the same buttons to perform the same moves. The D-pad is used to move, the control stick taunts, and the c-buttons can run and change targets. L dodges and R blocks. Pressing these at the last possible moment before being attacked initiates a counter move. A and B can grapple and strike respectively. Holding the buttons down perform stronger versions. After grappling, the player can use A or B and the d-pad to attempt different moves. These can be reversed with the R button.[CR]In the match itself, there is no health bar, but the wrestlers will begin to slouch, limp or hold a damaged limb. There is a momentum meter, however, which pulses more brightly and harder as moves and taunts are performed and gets slower and duller as damage is inflicted. Once the meter is maximized, a taunt will bring the wrestler into a sort of "rage" mode in which they can't be pinned or made to submit, their moves do significantly more damage and they can perform their devastating finisher.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]The game featured a prominent story mode which had no branching storyline, but accurately recorded wins and losses rather than having the match won or lost based on the plot. The story generally followed the major story lines of WWF television leading up to the previous WrestleMania.[CR]There is also an Exhibition Mode, in which any match may be set up with any wrestlers. The matches include standard wrestling fare, though it was notable at the time for including a Cage Match and a First Blood, as neither of the WCW games had either.[CR]It is the also first western THQ wrestling game to feature a create-a-wrestler mode rather than a simple costume change. The mode is extensive, allowing customization of appearance, taunts, entrances and a move-set. Once a wrestler is created, the player can enter them in the Story Mode. The create-a-wrestler mode also allows the default wrestlers' costumes to be edited with four different templates for alternate costumes (or in the case of Mankind, alternate wrestlers) with the same moves. The default wrestlers' moves couldn't be changed.[CR]There is even a create-a-belt feature in which you design the look of a belt and put them up for grabs in Exhibition matches. Up to ten belts can be created and customized.[CR]Playable Roster[CR]Al SnowBig Boss ManThe Big ShowThe Blue MeanieBradshawBrian ChristopherChazChris JerichoChristianChynaDebraD'Lo BrownDrozEdgeFaarooqGangrelGerald BriscoThe GodfatherHardcore HollyIvoryJacquelineJeff HardyJeff JarrettJerry "The King" LawlerJim RossKaneKen ShamrockMankind / Cactus Jack / Dude LoveMark HenryMatt HardyMeatMichael HayesMideonMr. AssPat PattersonPaul BearerPrince AlbertRoad DoggThe RockScott TaylorShane McMahonShawn MichaelsStephanie McMahonSteve BlackmanStone Cold Steve AustinTerri RunnelsTestThrasherToriTriple HThe UndertakerVal VenisVince McMahonVisceraX-Pac[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Wrestlers[CR]There are 7 secret characters you can get in Wrestlemania 2000.[CR]-Shawn Michaels = If you win the WWF title at Wrestlemania in Road to Wrestlemania, Shawn Michaels will challenge you, and now you can play as Shawn Michaels.[CR]-Jerry ''The King'' Lawler = Make it to Wrestlemania in Road to Wrestlemania, and Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross will introduce their selves and now you can play as them both.[CR]-Jim Ross = See Jerry Lawler.[CR]-Paul Bearer = Be The Undertaker in Road to Wrestlemania, and after a few matches Paul Bearer will start coming to the ring with you, and now you can play as Paul Bearer.[CR]-Stephanie Mcmahon = Be Test in Road to Wrestlemania and after a few matches Stephanie Mcmahon will start coming to the ring with you, and now you can play as Stephanie Mcmahon.[CR]-Dude Love = Win King of the Ring in Road to Wrestlemania, and you will get a Title shot at Summerslam, and if you win, Dude Love will Challenge you, and now you can play as Dude Love.[CR]-Cactus Jack = Win the hardcore belt and defend it 3 times and then Cactus Jack will challenge you, and now you can play as Cactus Jack.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Manager Assistance[CR]This will only work in single player matches.

		<title_clean>Xena - Warrior Princess - The Talisman of Fate</title_clean>
		<plot>Xena: Warrior Princess - Talisman of Fate is based on the TV-series Xena: Warrior Princess. The Nintendo 64 version of the series tie-in is a fighting game, unlike its PlayStation counterpart.[CR]The whole Xena universe is used in the game as all the levels and characters, except the new boss character, are familiar to the fans of the show. The action takes place in arenas which represent different kinds of surroundings with all the characters having their "own" level.[CR]The fighting is done with various weapons each character wielding his/her trademark weapon such as Xena's chakram, Gabrielle's staff and Callisto's sword. It includes most of the standard fighting-game modes such as story, vs. and training as well as a roster mode, where each player picks a succession of characters rather than just one.[CR]The fighting system is somewhat different from more traditional games.  The most obvious difference is that four players are allowed instead of two.  It can be a team battle or a free-for-all. The analog stick moves characters around on the ground in two dimensions, with separate buttons for block, jump and duck. The C-buttons handle attacks. Special moves are accomplished mostly by pulling the analog stick either toward your opponent, then away or vice-versa.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode and codes[CR]At the main menu press Right - Right - Left - Left - Right - Left - Right, then enter any of the following codes:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Despair[CR]Beat the Quest Mode with any character once to unlock Despair as a playable character.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Yoshi's Story is a platform game starring the various Yoshi's as they try to restore their world to a natural state after it's been turned into a picture book by Baby Bowser. To do this players pick one of the different colored Yoshis and hunt each level for 30 pieces of fruit. There's more than enough fruit to go around each levels but expert players will want to try to collect only melons as there are only 30 of them in each level. The game is a rather short game in comparison to the previous Yoshi game, Yoshi's island, but completionists will want to traverse through the game multiple times to unlock all the levels.[CR]International Version[CR]The International Version cartridge[CR]Besides the standard retail versions of Yoshi's Story released across the different territories, an additional one was produced by Nintendo dubbed the "International Version." In collector circles, the International Version of Yoshi's Story is significant because it is among the rarest cartridges produced for the Nintendo 64, especially since its existence wasn't confirmed until well over a decade after the original game's release. The game itself is largely the same, although it contains the markings of a Nintendo 64 kiosk demo and also has the odd quirk of having its text in Japanese, despite having an ESRB rating.[CR]Game Boy Advance Tech Demo[CR]Yoshi squaring off against a giant Shy Guy in the tech demo.[CR]When Nintendo originally announced the development of the Game Boy Advance in 2000, one of the available tech demos at the time was a scaled down, yet playable version of Yoshi's Story. The tech demo itself was not a port, as it only consisted of one level that repeated itself infinitely; once Yoshi traversed far enough, he automatically ended up at the beginning of the level again. Nonetheless, some basic gameplay features were retained in the GBA rendition, such as the ground pound and flower-shaped health meter. Nothing else directly related to Yoshi's Story was realized on the GBA other than the tech demo itself.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The American soundtrack for Yoshi's Story: Music to Pound the Ground To.[CR]The game also has a soundtrack in 3 versions. The American soundtrack's name is Music to Pound the Ground To Yoshi's Story Game Soundtrack while the European version's name is Love, Peace and Happiness. The soundtrack is composed by Kazumi Totaka, who also voices the title character of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Instant Death[CR]During gameplay, press the L Button, Z Button, A and B simultaneously. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]On top of the different epilogue messages depending on which levels you finished, there are also 4 different Happy Tree scene endings depending on your mood (the score).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See a Hidden Message from Yoshi[CR]At the end of each and every Mini-Game, get enough for a heart fruit and then eat it. After all the letters appear, put them in the right positions, and you'll get a hidden message from Yoshi.</plot>

		<plot>Description[CR]Professor Theo has been kidnapped by the imperial forces of the evil empire. Now his robotic personal assistant, Marina Liteyears, must save the day! Marina will get some help from the troops who have remained loyal to King Aster. With their help, she'll grab, shake and throw her way to the Professor! Besides rescuing the Professor, Marina will also join in the effort to rebel against that nasty, horrible and evil empire. So, Grab a controller and help our Super Heroine shake up the evil empire![CR][CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]While visiting the planet Clancer, Professor Theo, a self-proclaimed 'genius in robotics', is kidnapped by the Empire, acting upon orders from their evil emperor and estranged twin brother of Theo, who wishes to fill the world with hate and despair. Upon realizing Theo's abduction, his robotic maid Marina Liteyears sets out to rescue him.[CR]She proceeds to travel through over 50 levels on Planet Clancer to find her creator. Every person, animal, and inanimate object on the planet (including the planet itself) has an identical "face", seemingly belonging to a species called 'Clancer'. Along the way Marina attempts to rescue the professor but she is repeatedly impeded by agents of the Empire, whom she must defeat to rescue the professor.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Marina's main way of attacking is her grab move. She is able to take hold of enemies, objects, weapons and even some enemy projectiles or attacks, which can be thrown or shaken, depending on the object. When certain objects are shaken, items such as crystals might appear. When Marina shakes some other objects, a secondary effect may be activated.[CR]Later on in the game, Teran is available to play in two levels. His moves includes a standard punch, upper punch, low kick and a block move. He also has the ability to hang from ceilings. His signature skill is the ability to jump up to three times consecutively.[CR]Hidden within every stage is a gold gem. These gems are used in the final cutscene of the game with every gem adding one to three seconds to the ending. The extended ending adds character development to the villains, among various other things. The way the gold gem appears differs from stage to stage. For example, the gold gem will only appear on some boss stages if the boss is defeated without Marina being hit.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]    * Marina Liteyears/Marina Naget[CR]    * Professor Theo/Ganbell H.
