This list is filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR][CR]The TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem, originally known in Japan as the PC Engine, is a home video game console joint-developed by Hudson Soft and NEC, released in Japan on October 30, 1987, and in the United States on August 29, 1989. It was the first console released in the 16-bit era, albeit still utilizing an 8-bit CPU. Originally intended to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), it ended up competing against the likes of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super Famicom/Super Nintendo, and even the Neo Geo AES.[CR]The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit GPU; and is capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. The NEC PC Engine once held the record for the world's smallest game console.[CR]Developer:  Hudson Soft[CR]Manufacturer:  NEC[CR]CPU:  Hudson Soft HuC6280[CR]Memory:  64 kB[CR]Graphics:  HuC6260[CR]Sound:  6 Mini-Wavetable stereo audio channels[CR]Display:  256x239[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

The side scrolling space shooter was one of the most popular genre of games that was released on the TG-16 and that led to a virtual sea of titles to wade through. Aero Blasters was one the games that, amid an ocean of similar titles, shone as a bright example of a game that got EVERYTHING right.[CR]This is an undiscovered, classic representation, of everything that an arcade space shooter should be. You pilot a fighter jet style aircraft. Every so often an oscillating metal pod comes on the screen that you shoot until it explodes and a cascade of power up weapons breaks out. The game only has 8 possible different add on weapons. It also allows you to quickly acquire a ridiculously huge spread of bullets.[CR]The weapons that you get make the game really fun. You get 15 lives (unfortunately 1 bullet will kill you.) There are 4-6 weapon pods per level, so fear Not! Even if you die, you will be able to get your massive barrage of bullets back really quickly.[CR]You don't have to hit any special buttons or scroll through menus to activate your special weapons. You just start shooting and as you shoot your normal bullets, your special weapons fire out also. This lets you focus on just blasting everything on the screen without fumbling around with silly button combinations.[CR]The enemies come in essentially 2 flavors:[CR]1. Tons of small enemies that each shoot out a bullet or 2 which pepper the screen with slow moving objects that you must weave in and out of. These enemies require 1 hit to destroy.[CR]2. A few massively ill-proportioned enemies that shoot out a few, tiny, slow moving bullets.[CR]Your fighter jet is also very easy to control. The maneuverability of your fighter is just right, not too fast and not too slow. Some games start you out moving really slowly and you have to acquire speed ups and some games make you move so fast that you end up accidentally crashing because you can't control your ship.[CR]The best part of the game is that you never run out of bullets or special weapons. You just start shooting and you never stop and you never have to worry about running out of bullets.[CR]The game play relies heavily on patterns. You learn what enemies are going to come at you next and remembering how they will attack you so you are prepared to dodge and weave while at the same time blasting them to bits! This game really lets you use your weapons and forces you to dodge the slow moving bullets they left behind. It's challenging and very addictive because you really are testing your hand eye coordination. Every time I turn off this game I feel like I've accomplished something and I can't wait to play it again. I attribute that feeling to the duality of avoiding the bullets and hitting the targets.[CR]So to summarize:[CR]1. You get huge weapons.[CR]2. Your enemies don't get huge weapons. : )[CR]3. Your enemies require 1 hit to kill.[CR]4. You get 15 lives.[CR]5. Your ship is easy to maneuver.[CR]6. There are no stupid button combos to learn.[CR]7. Each of the levels are both visually and tactically different.[CR]8. Its a 1 player or 2 player game (both jets are on the screen at the same time.) [CR]HINTS:[CR]- Credits/Sound Test -[CR]On the title screen, push RIGHT 3 times, then push SELECT. Credits will appear and you can change them with UP/DOWN.

The cockpit was built on hydraulics, which simulated flight by moving the player roughly 25 degrees in both a horizontal and vertical axis, in a rough representation of the fighter's in-game movement. As the cockpit was enclosed on almost all sides, spectators who stood too close to the moving cockpit could be injured, so large screens (simulcasting the gameplay) were frequently mounted above the cabinet. This deluxe version often cost upward of $1.00USD for a single credit.[CR]Stereo speakers were placed at the ear level for the deluxe cabinet version, creating a very immersive (and sometimes deafening) play experience. The arcade controls consisted of a flight stick with multiple buttons and a throttle stick which could be used to slow down the aircraft or activate it's afterburners. The addition of the throttle was the most notable change from the original After Burner.[CR]There 23 stages in the game: Stages 5, 13 and 23 are non-playable landing cutscenes and levels 8 and 17 are canyon bombing runs. The remaining stages involve air to air combat using an unlimited cannon, and a limited supply of missiles. The missile supply is restored approximately every 2-3 levels in a non-playable air-air refuelling sequence, as well as in the first two landing cutscenes. Cameo's from the vehicles in Hang-On, and Out Run, make appearances during the first two landing cutscenes, driving down the runway in front of the F-14 as it is taking off.[CR]Points were rewarded for both distance traveled and enemies destroyed. For unknown reasons, the designers decided to reward players with literally millions of points for performing any sort of action in the game, making the high score table sometimes showing players with scores in the billions.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>28/9/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<studio>NEC Avenue</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.9</rating>		<videoid>23WgY59OSRI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20228</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588886-after-burner-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/after-burner-ii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/after-burner-ii/3030-2139/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10310</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20228-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/7/73970/1250267-afterburner2_gen_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111104-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111105-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-options.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111106-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-in-the-3d-room-you.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111107-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-taking-off.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111108-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage-1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111109-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-locked-on-a-target.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111110-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-tilting-to-the-left.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111111-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-tilting-to-the-right.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111112-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-shot-down.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/111113-after-burner-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage-2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/dbjnxee.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/20228.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Air Zonk (USA)">		<description>Air Zonk (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FAir%20Zonk%20%28USA%29.zip" size="324385" />		<title_clean>Air Zonk</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Air Zonk, named PC Denjin: Punkic Cyborgs in Japan, is a side scrolling shooter game. It is an unlikely and unusual sequel to the prior Bonk games from Hudson and NEC that were successful on the TurboGrafx-16. The game was developed by Red Company and provided an update to the popular boy-caveman character Bonk. For this game Bonk is renamed Air Zonk and converted into a more punk rock, modern and contemporary style. The result being a punk rock cyborg character sporting sun glasses and a mohawk. The game even uses the same villain from the Bonk series, King Drool.[CR]Red Company and Hudson Soft decided instead of creating a direct sequel to the Bonk games' popular platformer gameplay, Air Zonk would be a side-scrolling shooter game. Side-scrolling shooters being almost equally popular as platformers in the early nineties video game era. Air Zonk's art style was somewhat distinctive in the shooter category at the time, using cute cartoon like graphics, in a very similar manner as presented in the earlier Bonk games. The game is recognized by most as what would be called a "Cute 'Em Up," a cuter art style version of a typical "Shoot 'Em Up." Other games in this "Cute 'Em Up" style of the period included Parodius and Ordyne. Air Zonk was originally released on November 20, 1992 in North America.  [CR]Air Zonk was later adopted as the mascot for the TurboDuo video game console, the followup to the TurboGrafx-16 released by Turbo Technologies, Inc. (TTi) in the USA which included the CD drive peripheral as standard, as well as an increased RAM size. Air Zonk received a sequel game named Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly Paradise (CD Denjin Rockabilly in Japan) for the SuperCD format used on the TurboDuo console. Most critics and players considered the Super Air Zonk sequel to be sub-par and not as good as the first game due to the lack of parallax scrolling in the game.[CR]The original game has been rereleased on Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console in 2009 in Japan, North America and Europe.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Air Zonk is a side scrolling shoot 'em up with several unique gameplay elements that separate it from the glut of shooters that existed on the TurboGrafx-16 and other consoles of the time. The game includes the use of assistants to the game's main character Air Zonk and also several unique power-ups throughout the game. The game has three difficulty levels that it names humorously as sweet for easy, spicy for normal and bitter for hard.[CR]Players can choose an assistant companion character at the onset of the game and then chose one of these friends for each subsequent level, or friends can be automatically assigned in a particular order. Friends can only be used once through the course of the game. Friends are enabled by collecting five smiley faces, which were also used in the Bonk games as bonus stage currency, and then collecting a large super smiley face. Once enabled, companions assist Air Zonk by attacking enemies alongside the player and granting special attacks and invulnerability. If a second super smiley face is collected and Air Zonk's companion friend is unharmed, Air Zonk and the friend transform into a strange combined form with even stronger attacks and invulnerability. For example, one combined form has Air Zonk don a torpedo bra a la Madonna that actually shoots missiles.

The game was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console and will be released in February 2011 on PlayStation Network by Hudson Entertainment. It was also the first game in the "Crush Pinball" series followed by three sequels: Devil's Crush, Jaki Crush (only released in Japan for the Super Famicom), and Alien Crush Returns. Alien Crush was a launch title for the TurboGrafx-16 in North America.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Alien Crush only has one table, two screens high, to play on. It is played from a top down perspective, and both the bottom and top halves of the table contain their own flippers that the player controls. The table contains various areas with ball entries, some of which lead to small bonus tables where the main task consists of destroying different alien creatures with the ball for points. As soon as a ball is lost, the bonus table ends and the player is sent back to the main table. The main goal in Alien Crush is to collect as much points as possible before losing all of the balls, and once that happens the game is then over and requires having to restart. The player can interact with different things on the pinball table to help them by making it harder to lose the ball, and gain more points etc.. Some areas require that the player performs various objectives, and randomly having to face bosses, which can be difficult to defeat without losing the ball. Also on the table are numerous moving targets as well as ball locks, which lock the ball in place for a few seconds before shooting it back out.[CR]The player can also choose between fast or slow ball speed, and having two different music tracks.[CR]PS Vita Compatibility[CR]Despite not being in the official compatibility list, Alien Crush can be played on the PS Vita. To do this, the user must first download the game to the PS3. From there, go to Content Transfer on the PS Vita and select the game for transfer. Once complete, the game will show up on the Vita's menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] View score during gameplay[CR]Press select while pausing.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See The Ending[CR]Achieve a score of 999,999,900 points and the ending will start.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 1 Million Points + Bonus Ball[CR]Get to the bonus round with skulls and green aliens.

Ankoku Densetsu is a platform hack and slash game, much in the vein of Rastan. You travel through various dark and gloomy settings, chopping the heads of green maggot-spitting zombies, skeleton warriors and other denizens of the evil realms that no self respecting barbarian could ignore.[CR]There are several types of weapons to collect - the sword is standard, the axe is quite powerful but short range, and the long chain weapon is less powerful but very useful at taking out the baddies at a distance. With the relevant power capsules, each weapon can be powered up several levels to inflict more damage. You also get a pretty little fairy star that you throw out in front of you to viciously incinerate all who dare oppose your will. While there is plenty of hacking action, there is also a platform element, with you having to navigate your way up a waterfall on falling blocks, and find your way out of an area with skull platforms that drop out from beneath your feet.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]This is probably the closest thing to Rastan (the original, not the awful Rastan II) that you can get on the PC Engine. Graphically, the game is a mixed bag. The general atmosphere is well crafted, with dark, gloomy scenery, although lacking in imagination. The sprites and animation are poorer than I would have hoped for. There's something not right about the shading which makes your main character in particular look a little amateurish, and the walk cycle when holding the chain weapon, for example, just looks stupid.[CR]Some of the bosses are well done though and there are a few neat touches like the parallax scrolling on one of the later levels. Audio is excellent - it sounds just like an extension of Dungeon Explorer and sets the mood very well indeed. With a little more work (and maybe a little more ROM on the HuCard) this could have been a stunning game. As it stands, while the visuals are variable, it still holds up as a highly enjoyable action platformer and well worth putting some time into.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- extra credits -[CR]when GAME OVER appears, hold II + RUN and keep tapping LEFT.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Ankoku_Densetsu.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 continues[CR]At the title screen, enter any of the following codes:</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Victor Interactive Software</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.0</rating>		<videoid>ec4HmMeISBw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5675</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589018-legendary-axe-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legendary-axe-ii/3030-6441/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5675-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5675-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716475-legendaryaxeii001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299164-tla2_026.png</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299163-tla2_025.png</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299162-tla2_024.png</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299161-tla2_023.png</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299160-tla2_022.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299159-tla2_021.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299158-tla2_020.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299157-tla2_019.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1299156-tla2_018.png</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Aoi Blink (Japan)">		<description>Aoi Blink (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FAoi%20Blink%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="247907" />		<title_clean>Aoi Blink</title_clean>		<plot>This is an excellent little platform game. Well, it's pretty decent anyways. It's the same old story you've heard before: boy finds magical blue donkey-horse, boy's father goes missing, boy joins up with two convicted felons, a princess, and a bus driver to find boy's father. Yaaaawn.[CR]So you run around with a couple of your new-found friends and shoot things and jump on other things. Each has their own abilities, so you can switch between them all by pushing Select. The princess can jump really high, for instance, but she can't shoot. Whenever you fall into a pit, or lose all your life, Blink the magical flying blue donkey-horse comes along and saves you. Weird? Absolutely. But then, what did you expect from a TurboGrafx game?[CR]Translation Description:[CR]This translation also suffers from the affliction known as Disturbing Lack of an Apostrophe, but it won't really get in the way of enjoying the game. It's a platformer for God's sake. And the translation's complete, so enjoy it.

It is operated by a drawing tablet peripheral named the "Illust Booster", which allowed users to draw directly onto the screen with a stylus similar to the art tablets of today, and another peripheral the "Print Booster", which allowed users to print their on-screen creations to paper as well the "Photo Reader" which worked as an image scanner. As well as a basic set of drawing tools, the player could switch between three music tracks to listen to as they worked. [CR]The game is a particularly rare and thus valuable HuCard to collectors, due to the number of equally rare and pricey peripherals that were sold along with it.

The control method takes a little getting used to - pressing button I selects from one of four weapons collected along the way, whereas holding down button I will lock you to the direction you are facing, making backing-away and firing easier. It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it.[CR]The four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress. Levels are varied - some are horizontal, some are more like mazes and there are also two types of boss area: one with a small enemy over the opposite side of the screen protected by a barrier you have to destroy, and another with a huge mechanical monster that follows you relentlessly around an arena.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Atomic Robo-Kid Special is an unconventional beast as far as shooters go. Gameplay is fairly unique, there is a nice learning curve and you'll enjoy the game all the more as you work out the little tricks and tactics in certain levels. There is plenty of graphical variety and although some stage graphics are often repeated, there are many one-shot levels to give you a bit extra to look at.[CR]Speaking of the graphics, they are generally excellent, especially the enemy sprites and bosses - all beautifully drawn mecha designs that look very solid and shiny. Some backdrops are a little basic in places, but most are very pretty to look at. There is some sprite flicker on bosses, but considering their size, I think we can forgive it. Sound-wise, the game is variable. Sound effects are great but the music is a little weedy at times - although the tunes are often pretty good. I really enjoy Robo-Kid, it has a feeling of exploration as well as finger cramping shooting action and it's certainly worth sticking with until you complete it.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Atomic_Robo-Kid_Special.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See The Ending[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Down, Left, Right, I, II, I, II, Up, Down, Left, Right, I, II, II, I, Select.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>UPL</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>DxILMCu_OVw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20235</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588894-atomic-robo-kid-special</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/atomic-robo-kid-special/3030-48563/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10292</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20235-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/4/7/51547_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804528-atomicrobokid005.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804527-atomicrobokid004.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804526-atomicrobokid003.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804525-atomic_robokid_special_%28j%29-005.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804523-atomicrobokid002.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804522-atomicrobokid001.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804521-atomic_robokid_special_%28j%29-004.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804520-atomic_robokid_special_%28j%29-003.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804519-atomic_robokid_special_%28j%29-002.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2804518-atomic_robokid_special_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/NTOHqEU.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="AV Poker - World Gambler (Japan)">		<description>AV Poker - World Gambler (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FAV%20Poker%20-%20World%20Gambler%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="321700" />		<title_clean>AV Poker - World Gambler</title_clean>		<plot>Unlicensed PC Engine release by Games Express. AV Poker is not a full poker simulator, but a simple gambling game. You choose from Normal, which is a standard game or Special Mode, where you travel around the world to show off your gambling skills. The poker part of the game is extremely simple. You place a bet, get a hand dealt to you, choose which cards to hold, and get a second deal to fill in the discards. If you match any of the standard poker hands, you win. You then get the options of taking the cash or playing a higher-lower game to increase your winnings significantly. Occasionally, you also get a fruit machine style mini-game which gives you the chance of winning 'special' cards that can be used during the game.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]The problem with AV Poker is its simplicity. There are no players to play against, no bluffing, none of the usual poker thrills. It's just a case of bet, get lucky (or not) and bet again. This makes the game extremely tedious in the long run and even the added mini-games are not interesting enough to keep you playing. And of course, because this is by Games Express, there are the obligatory images of women in various stages of undress - but you will get bored long before you get that far.

The player is one of two partially robotic athletes that has to direct a ball into a goal via other balls fired at high speeds from the player's weapon. By hitting the play ball at the right angle with sufficient force, they can be knocked around the table into the opponent's goal. Likewise, the opponent is trying to do the same with the player's goal. The game supports up to two human players.[CR]The game was converted to other home computers and the TurboGrafx-16 by Reflections Interactive (now Ubisoft Reflections). The home computer versions were published by Psygnosis (sometimes using their alternate name Psyclapse), while the TG16 version was published by Turbo Technologies and Coconuts Japan, in the US and Japan respectively. [CR]Ballistix's cover art was designed by Melvyn Grant, an artist known for heavy metal covers. Along with Derek Riggs, he's responsible for many Iron Maiden album covers featuring Eddie, their mascot. Psygnosis would often bring in artists from other media to create their box art.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 VS</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.1</rating>		<videoid>wBbkhqtxl3Y</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8188</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588896-ballistix</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/ballistix</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ballistix/3030-15973/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/703819-ballistix_f.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8188-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46391-ballistix-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195146-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-where-s-psyclapse.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195147-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-ballistix.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195148-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195149-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-play-fair-gentlemen.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195150-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-starting-a-new-game.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195151-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195152-ballistix-turbografx-16-screenshot-near-the-goal.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722701-5350628368-8jyse.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722682-6753877973-dEnFT.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722681-7813753449-RQ4jZ.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Bari Bari Densetsu (Japan)">		<description>Bari Bari Densetsu (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBari%20Bari%20Densetsu%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="224781" />		<title_clean>Bari Bari Densetsu</title_clean>		<plot>Bari Bari Densetsu is a Driving game, published by Taito Corporation,which was released in Japan in 1989.</plot>		<releasedate>29/11/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing, Arcade</genre>		<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>20241</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579509-bari-bari-densetsu</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/bari-bari-densetsu</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/baribari-densetsu/3030-51727/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20241-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552101-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552102-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552103-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-picking-a-track.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552104-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-pre-race-setup.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552105-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-regulation-mode.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552108-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-on-the-starting.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552106-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-on-the-track.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/552107-bari-bari-densetsu-turbografx-16-screenshot-preminaly-results.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802829-baribaridensetsu002.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802825-bari_bari_densetsu_%28j%29-002.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Barunba (Japan)">		<description>Barunba (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBarunba%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="219241" />		<title_clean>Barunba</title_clean>		<plot>Barunba is a shooter in comic style.

Both bosses have to be defeated before you can continue to finish the level or go to the next.[CR]A status bar at the bottom of the screen shows the energy bar of your ship and it's Game Over when that bar has depleted.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Namco Limited</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>SR23-Sa2KCE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20242</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588897-barunba</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/barunba</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/barunba/3030-13278/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/12092</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20242-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/5/2/51552_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138283-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-game-intro.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138284-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138285-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-area-one-float-island.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138286-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-shoot-the-ducks.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138287-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-pick-up-the-letter-pods.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138288-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-letter-pods-can-contain-weapon.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138289-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138290-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-area-two-the-lake-area.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138291-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-decending-the-trenches-of.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/138292-barunba-turbografx-16-screenshot-insects-all-over.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/jIWOAwN.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Batman (Japan)">		<description>Batman (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBatman%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="268446" />		<title_clean>Batman</title_clean>		<plot>With all the hype surrounding the movie, it was inevitable that tie-in games would pop up on virtually every format. But while you would most likely expect a straightforward action platformer, Sunsoft have decided to go down an altogether different path for the PC Engine incarnation.[CR]When you boil it down to the basics, Batman is essentially an evolutionary step on from Pac Man. The gameplay is maze-based and is split into several different locations, each with 12 small to medium sized stages. These stages are inhabited by the Joker's minions - most of which wander aimlessly around waiting to be clobbered, but some of which rush around, fire weapons or home in on you with alarming speed. You start off walking very slowly, with a short range baterang, but as you progress, power-up icons will give you more speed, a longer range and multiple shots. Each location has a different type of objective - collecting the Joker's chemically-altered cosmetics, laying bombs, cleaning paintings in the museum etc., although basically the only differences are graphical. Once every item has been collected/cleaned/whatever, the stage ends and it's on to the next one. Lose all your lives and you get the choice to continue, or end the game and receive a password.[CR]Passwords are essential as the game is far too long to finish in one sitting.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Batman is a pretty fun game. Although the repetitive nature of the gameplay can drag it down a little, it is still fun to play and a treat for the eyes and ears. Graphics are well drawn - suitably dark and moody, and of special note are the animated sequences every 12 levels - they are very impressive for a HuCard game. The sound is great as well - the excellent use of samples gives the sound a unique quality and the growly chip sound makes great use of the Engine's sonic capabilities. It's not exactly a difficult game if you keep your wits about you, but the length of it makes up for that. It was bold for Sunsoft to try something different with such a major license, but it works well enough and is a refreshing change from the norm.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Batman.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Axis Chemical Factory passwords[CR]Use the key given for the Gotham City passwords.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Axis Chemical Factory passwords[CR]Use the key given for the Gotham City passwords.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Axis Chemical Factory passwords[CR]Use the key given for the Gotham City passwords.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Axis Chemical Factory passwords[CR]Key for entering passwords:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Axis Chemical Factory passwords[CR]BD: Batman facing down[CR]BL: Batman facing left[CR]BU: Batman facing up[CR]BR: Batman facing right[CR]JD: Joker facing down[CR]JL: Joker facing left[CR]JU: Joker facing up[CR]JR: Joker facing right</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>SunSoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>TySHiSxdkyQ</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20243</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588898-batman</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/batman</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/batman/3030-26351/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10293</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20243-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/314998-batman-turbografx-16-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/314999-batman-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133757-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133758-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage-1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133759-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-pick-up-the-items.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133760-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-kill-those-clowns.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133761-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-use-your-bat-wing.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566809-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-gotham-city-streets-are-riddled.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566810-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-batman-steps-in.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566811-batman-turbografx-16-screenshot-batman-the-painting-cleaner.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/160705/2263162-batmanscreen3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/160705/2263161-batmanscreen2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/SY85ddN.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/20243.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Battle Lode Runner (Japan)">		<description>Battle Lode Runner (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBattle%20Lode%20Runner%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="131224" />		<title_clean>Battle Lode Runner</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Lode Runner is a mutliplayer-focused spin on the classic action/puzzle game Lode Runner that takes several cues from Hudson's Bomberman series.

If another player walks into the hole, they become trapped until the hole eventually reforms, killing whoever is trapped there. Players can also dig up blocks to find power-ups, including a skull that gives them a randomized negative status that they can hot potato to other players by touching them.[CR]Battle Lode Runner was a Japanese PC Engine exclusive (released in 1993) until it was eventually released in the US and Europe for the first time via the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Begin at level 61 with unlimited lives[CR]From the "game select" screen select "puzzle mode" then "pass word."</plot>		<releasedate>10/2/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft Company</studio>		<nplayers>1-5 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>20244</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588899-battle-lode-runner</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/battle-lode-runner</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/battle-lode-runner/3030-13011/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10294</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20244-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/5/7/51557_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/322585-battle-lode-runner-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/322586-battle-lode-runner-turbografx-16-screenshot-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723081-3825816131-Z8uv3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723080-4486269971-8gcjg.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723079-5310488510-bWJDZ.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723078-8548590382-jY5WN.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723077-7863905686-4k6tL.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723076-3319048427-86iIy.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723075-8683140708-zvUN9.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/8/gfs_4302_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Hmu4qQe.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Battle Royale (USA)">		<description>Battle Royale (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBattle%20Royale%20%28USA%29.zip" size="319420" />		<title_clean>Battle Royale</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Royale is a wrestling game for the TurboGrafx-16, and one of a handful TG16 games to be exclusive to the US.

The player, as their chosen wrestler, then fights the other wrestlers in a ring with the goal to lower their health and then throw them out of the ring, a la "Royal Rumble" rules.

Once all balls are in place it's on to the next level. Easy, right? Well, maybe not, as there is all manner of wildlife out to put paid to your spherical antics, from hedgehogs to monkeys and penguins. Luckily, the balls themselves do have a use - give them a swift kick and they'll get rid of any creature barring your way. And if you are persistent, you can even whack down walls. Also, be on the lookout for various items scattered around that aid you in your task, like time-stops, smart bombs etc.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]First off, I'll promise not to make any crude jokes about cute girls manhandling massive balls. OK? Right.[CR]Graphics in Be Ball are pretty nice. Good big, chunky sprites, brightly coloured with nice animation. Levels are maybe a bit repetitive and could have done with a few more touches of variety. Music is cute and OK, but nothing you'll be rushing to record off in a hurry.[CR]The game itself is decent. The single screen per level layout can seem a little restrictive, and I think it may have advantaged from larger scrolling maps at times, but I suppose the claustrophobic layout gives a sense of urgency to the gameplay as you have to be very aware of what is following close behind. An advantage is the ability to play with 2 players simultaneously, and there is also a (very) simple kickball game to play, as well as a map editor for those creative designers among you. The puzzle element is pretty minimal as this is mostly an arcade experience and although not as fun as other action puzzlers like Bomber Man and Battle Lode Runner, Be Ball is certainly worth a look..[CR]HINTS:[CR]- Level select -[CR]Enter your password as 677261[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Be_Ball.htm[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Hudson</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>8198</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579587-chew-man-fu</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/chew-man-fu/3030-1452/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10262</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8198-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8198-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716331-chewmanfu001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716330-be_ball_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716329-chewmanfu001.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716327-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-021.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716326-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-020.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716325-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-019.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716324-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-018.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716323-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-017.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716322-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-016.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716321-chew-man-fu_%28u%29-015.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/D3U9cEu.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Benkei Gaiden (Japan)">		<description>Benkei Gaiden (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBenkei%20Gaiden%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="268476" />		<title_clean>Benkei Gaiden</title_clean>		<plot>For many years, monsters have been terrorizing the peaceful lands, until finally, the Buddhist priests known as the Dharma Eyes found a safe heaven in a secluded temple, where they raised young martial artists who would eventually liberate the people from the monsters. One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end to the monster invasion.[CR]Benkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early  Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as "Talk" or "Search", rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Misc.

It was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console in NA on May 21, 2007, and in Europe on May 25, 2007. In the Japanese release only, it is loosely based off the Japanese film Gunhed (an 1989 Cyberpunk Mech movie - the titular Gunhed was a hybrid tank/walking mech which doesn't appear in any form in the game).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Blazing Lazers is an overhead shoot 'em up. The basic gun is changed or upgraded by killing enemies and subsequently shooting orbs that spawn. The weapon orbs are numbered by Roman Numerals from I - IV, based on weapon class. Different weapons can combine together or specific weapons can upgrade until reaching full power, but shooting another weapon orb will lose the full power of the current weapon. A number of "cluster bombs" are also available to the player, which wipe the screen of most enemies instantly. Additionally, purple colored orbs power a shield which blocks a limited amount of enemy fire. Shooting a purple orb will eventually turn it gold, which gives a free life.Blazing Lazers in Stage 7.[CR]The game consists of nine stages, and one or more bosses on each. The game also has a checkpoint system, though gold orbs allow an immediate respawn without returning to a checkpoint.[CR]Assisted weapons, including homing missiles, shields, and a power called "full fire" are available upgrades.[CR]Power Ups[CR]BulletsLevel 1 - A simple stream of forward flying bullets.Level 2 - A double stream of forward flying bullets.Level 3 - A double stream of forward flying bullets, plus a rearward stream of bullets.Level 4 - A spread stream of forward flying bullets, plus a double rearward stream of bullets.Level 5 - Ship now has guns surrounding the hull shooting two bullets forward, one from the rear as well as a diagonal spread.[CR]WavesLevel 1 - Shoots one boomerang shaped wave from the front of the ship.Level 2 - Adds an additional wave to the back of the ship that changes direction, shooting backwards and then forwards at the enemy.Level 3 - Adds one additional wave to the front of the ship.Level 4 - Also the same as Level 2 but adds 3 waves to the rear of the ship.Level 5 - The Ship will now shoot 3 waves from the front as well as 3 from the back.[CR]LazersLevel 1 - Shoots one blue lazer.Level 2 - One blue lazer that circles in front of the ship before shooting.Level 3 - Much like level 2, Level 3 adds one additional lazer.Level 4 - 4 Lazers shooting from the front of the ship.Level 5 - Lazers shooting from the ship will exit from the front, travel forward before pushing off to the edge of the screen.[CR]RingsLevel 1 - One ring surrounding the ship that will absorb shots.Level 2 - Uses that same ring at a different orbit for more protection.Level 3 - Two Rings now surround the ship for added defense.Level 4 - Three rings will now surround the ship giving it added protection.Level 5 - Four rings are better then three.[CR](when using rings the ship's guns default to Level 1 Bullets)[CR]Enhancements[CR]Comet Wave - This weapon is granted to the ship by getting Firepower (marked by a large floating F) when it is using bullets. This ability adds more bullets to the side of the ship.Ultra Waves - This weapon is granted to the ship when it has a wave weapon. When picking up this enhancement it doubles the amount of waves coming from the ship.Homing Beam - Received when grabbing the Firepower enhancement with a Lazer, the beams will now lock onto enemies.Ring Beam - When using Rings and picking up the Firepower enhancement the rings on the ship will now fly forward at the enemy.Overshield - Marked by a floating S, this gives the ship a red shield that can take many hits before depleting.Module - A small piece of machinery will now travel beside the ship shooting the basic type of the weapon that it is firing.Homing Missiles - A weapon that is usually avoided due to being slow, the ship will shoot multiple missiles at enemies on screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode[CR]Enable Sound Test cheat.

There has since been countless iterations on its blueprint and huge multiplayer communities around them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a robot working at a bomb factory who gets bored of making bombs. He hears a rumor that anyone that makes it out from the underground factory gets a wish. Bomberman, desperate to escape, sets out on a journey to the surface. The only thing standing in his way is the factory security guards who will do anything to stop him. Spoiler alert: Bomberman will turn into Runner when he reaches the surface.[CR]Other Versions[CR]The Famicom version differed slightly from the MSX original, so the Famicom version was ported back to the MSX under the title "Bomber Man Special".[CR]European versions were released under the names "Eric and the Floaters" (MSX/Spectrum) and Dyna Blaster (Amiga, Atari ST, and PC)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage and Item Select[CR]Start a new game and get 300 points as your Hi Score.

It saw a sequel in Japan called Bomberman '94. It was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America and Europe while keeping all of its multiplayer features from the original game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bomberman '93 is a top down perspective puzzle game. Bomberman is set in stages that resemble mazes, and laying a bomb next to blocks that can be destroyed will open up the arena a little more. Bombs blow up in a cross shape explosion, and whatever the explosion hits will be destroyed, including the player that placed it. Power-ups can also be earned to gain greater bomb explosion or speed, as well as the ability to set multiple bombs at once. Also, if another bomb's explosion hits another, it will blow up instantly as well in a chain reaction, and these features occurring in both single player and multiplayer.Single Player[CR]The single player aspect contains seven themed worlds to travel to, and each containing a set of eight levels. Each level consists of blocks to blow up and enemies scattered around that Bomberman has to destroy as well. There are power-ups hidden under the blocks to help the player through the level, and once all of the enemies are defeated a portal will appear leading to the next level. A boss battle will occur at the eighth stage of each world. Also, for the first time in the Bomberman series, each level is more interactive, such as conveyor belts to move bombs around. Bomberman can also kick bombs as well.Multiplayer[CR]The multiplayer allows up to 5 players to play at the same time in a timed deathmatch using power-ups and trying to stay alive while competing with the other players. The last player alive at the end is the winner, and exclusive to multiplayer are skulls, which make randomly bad things happen to the player that picked it up.[CR]On the Wii's Virtual Console, the game can only support 4 Wii Remotes, and the fifth player has to hold the R button on the GameCube controller while starting the game from the Wii menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Menu (Japanese Version)[CR]After the ending, when the "END" screen is displayed, wait until the music is over, hold Button 1 and press Run. If done right a sound will be heard. Now, hold Run and press Select to soft-reset the game. Start a Normal game and before the level starts, you'll get the debug menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Menu (Japanese Version)[CR]You need a multi tap for this code to work. At the title screen, highlight "Battle Game", hold Up + I + II + Select + Run on Controller 5 and then press Run on Controller 1.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Turbo Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1-5</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>4.4</rating>		<videoid>hywbi9l6k3o</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8191</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588907-bomberman-93</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/bomberman-93</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/bomberman-93/3030-7646/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10295</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8191-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8191-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79163-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99415-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-options.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99416-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-disputed-planets.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99417-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-bomberman-s-control-room.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99418-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-planet-quarry.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99419-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-there-s-the-exit.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99420-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-bomberman-kills-himself.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99421-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-oh-my-god-it-s-pac-man.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99422-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-say-hello-to-digger.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99423-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-bomberman-flies-off-to.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99424-bomberman-93-turbografx-16-screenshot-how-nice-of-digger-give.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/1ILSd9n.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Bomberman '94 (Japan)">		<description>Bomberman '94 (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBomberman%20%2794%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="575066" />		<title_clean>Bomberman '94</title_clean>		<plot>Never one to leave a good thing to be forgotten, Hudson are back with the third installment of the ever present Bomber Man series, and with this one comes a few changes. Apart from our dumpy little hero having lost a little weight since '93, the gameplay has also been altered significantly.[CR]While still retaining the basic bombing action, completing a level now no longer requires you to destroy all enemies on screen. Instead, you have to find and destroy a set of pillars on each level and these will unlock a broken piece of amulet from its protected dome. Collect the piece and all remaining destructible blocks turn into coins and you have about 15 seconds to collect as many as possible. Another major addition is kangaroo-type animals that you can jump on and ride. These have special abilities, like jumping and such and also count as an extra hit in case you walk into an enemy or stupidly blow yourself up.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Graphics and level design has improved yet again for this update, with the levels looking far less rigidly planned and more natural. Nice little touches add to the game, like the ripple effect on the water levels, and music again is jolly and catchy. Multi-player is better than ever with the addition of different characters to play (fat, tiny, old...). If you're a big Bomber Man fan or new to the series then you should have this game, but if you have either of the prequels and are only vaguely interested, then maybe you should think twice, but this is the best version of the three.

In arcade versions, Bonk would be accompanied by a female version of himself.[CR]In Bonk's Adventure, the player assumes the role of the caveman Bonk. The player must navigate their way through five different worlds to rescue Princess Za, who has been captured by the dinosaur, King Drool. In a time when consoles had to have mascots, Bonk was the solution for the TurboGrafx-16. As a platformer it would be held in direct comparison to Mario and Sonic. Although it was a star when it came to graphics, in particular color palette, it never garnered enough popular appeal to push sales of the Turbo-Grafx.[CR]In November/December 2006, Bonk's Adventure was released on the Wii's Virtual Console. It is currently available for 600 Nintendo Points and supports all controller types. It was also added to the PlayStation Network store in 2011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bonk's weapon is his large head, which can be used to defeat the various prehistoric enemies that stand in his way. While on the ground, Bonk smashes his head forward. In the air the headbutt creates a spin that, by pressing the button repeatedly, can slow Bonk's descent. Bonk is capable of juggling an opponent, gaining more points with each consecutive hit. The term juggling makes particular sense in this game since each time Bonk hits the enemy from below they pop up in an arc and Bonk must run to catch them before they land. Lives are gained through score, as well as found within the world, although they are few and far between.[CR]In addition to prehistoric monsters there are a number of pod-like flowers that offer goodies for Bonk. Some of those goodies are fruits and vegetables that boost Bonk's score. Others contain meat, and an handful are hidden monsters that will pop up and bounce after Bonk.[CR]If Bonk collects meat he evolves. There are 3 different levels for Bonk to evolve to. The first level is where he starts. The second level Bonk gets blue tints and is able to pound the ground and temporarily freeze enemies. The third level turns Bonk into an invulnerable, green tinted version of himself. This invulnerability only last a short time. Meat comes in two forms: Small meat will only transform Bonk one level whereas large meat will transform him two levels. After enough time, and without more meat, Bonk will revert back to his original self.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 5 levels in Bonk's Adventure. Each has a number of sub-level to complete that basically requires Bonk to move to the right, jump over enemies and avoid pits and traps. Occasionally there would be doors for Bonk to enter, which would result in a mini-game. These mini-games include a vertical drop where the challenge is for Bonk to spin and eventually land on his feet; a challenge to headbutt rocks of lava that come out of a volcano, and a jumping challenge where Bonk bounces from flower to flower trying to collect the most fruit without falling into the pits below. After completing the mini-game Bonk is dropped back into the world he came from in the exact state he left it. After 8 mini-levels Bonk encounters a boss by hopping in a bizarre dinosaur skull elevator.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]In total there are six different bosses in the game, four of which are being controlled by King Drool. Each boss wears some sort of headgear which Bonk must destroy by headbutting it until it breaks.HueyHuey, the game's first boss.[CR]Huey is one of the enemies being brainwashed by King Drool. He blows bubbles as an attack, and requires fifteen hits to beat. After a few hits, the brainwashing helmet is damaged and on the fifteenth blow is subdued.[CR]"Gee Wiz!! Thanks!! I feel a lot better. I'm your new friend. Arf Arf Arf!!"Gladdis[CR]Gladdis has the ability to create a clone of herself, after which Bonk must attack the real Gladdis with a head stomp. The imaginary Gladdis will jump around and throw stars, but Bonk will pass seamlessly through her. In the next phase of her pattern, Gladdis returns to a single form and teleports around the screen, shooting stars at Bonk.[CR]"You're my hero!! You've won my heart and mind, Bonk!!"Kongo Zilla[CR]Kongo Zilla's stage takes place on icy terrain, which makes handling Bonk more difficult. Kongo Zilla digs underground with his spiked arms and throws ice blocks at Bonk.[CR]"You made a monkey out of me, Bonk. Come to think of it, I am a monkey! By the way, have you seen Princess Za?"Punchy Pedro[CR]Punchy Pedro is named for his punches. One of which is quick and the other of which does a significant amount of damage.

In fact, this is the only one that I can think of. It looks and plays like those games you used to see in arcades and has plenty of options to choose from. Firstly you get to choose from simulation, action and technique (which lets you try out loads of trick shots). Then, you can play against other humans, your coach or try out the challenge mode that sets you up as a stowaway on a cruise liner, having to beat 14 opponents to be let off the hook! The play screen is laid out clearly - you aim by positioning a target anywhere on the table (unlike some games that make you aim to the cushion), then you can choose the regulars like spin and shot power.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Visually, Break In is nicely presented and uses a good colour scheme. You wouldn't think there's much scope in drawing pool balls, but these are really well done and look nice and shiny. Ball physics leaves a little to be desired - the movement is a little slow and wobbly, and sometimes the balls tend to stop a bit quicker than they ought to, but it won't upset anyone but the perfectionists out there. The music is suitably reminiscent of bar room jazz and hums along harmlessly in the background. Overall, it's a pretty decent pool game with many different styles of game and trick shots to choose from. It won't set the world on fire and may be too dull for some, but given the lack of choice this is worth getting if it's the kind of thing that pushes your button.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Break_In.htm[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Sports, Pool</genre>		<studio>Naxat Soft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>1</rating>		<videoid>ohmDswbrjw8</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20248</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588915-break-in</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/break-in_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/break-in/3030-44252/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20248-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723085-5510237274-IQgcK.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723084-2061326278-UjTsO.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723083-0800493428-ngw7fcpl.png+</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2723082-7100807965-Z0iz20xk.png+</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2720653-3991347840-gfs_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/c/e/gfs_4861_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/1/e/gfs_4861_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/a/e/gfs_4861_1_3.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/b/e/gfs_4861_1_4.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/0/e/gfs_4861_1_5.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Bubblegum Crash! - Knight Sabers 2034 (Japan)">		<description>Bubblegum Crash! - Knight Sabers 2034 (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FBubblegum%20Crash%21%20-%20Knight%20Sabers%202034%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="318172" />		<title_clean>Bubblegum Crash! - Knight Sabers 2034</title_clean>		<plot>BubbleGum Crash.

The player selects a boxer and a trainer and takes on a series of increasingly tougher opponents. The games uses a horizontal 2D perspective of the ring, except when one of the boxers has been knocked down: the view then changes to a top-down perspective as they struggle to get back up before the ten-count finishes.[CR]The game also supports a "survival" tournament mode and a "fighting" mode, which is a side-scrolling brawler where the player character fights through a number of different opponents on the streets.

It's up to the Burning Angels to rescue her! And so starts another vertically scrolling shooter on the PC Engine. There are no surprises in the gameplay here - choose one of two ships, shoot down enemies and collect power upgrades and energy pods. Levels range from the city to the desert and the obligatory sci-fi enemy base. At the end of each level, defeat the large boss craft to move on.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Although not majorly poor in any area, Burning Angels is such a standard shooter that it is hard to work up any excitement for it. Sprites are big, there is plenty going on and graphics are mostly decent (even if the clouds look more like rocks). It can be a bit frustrating as you only have one energy bar and no continues, but practice enough and it's not too much of a hassle. The music is nice but bland, like much of the game, though there is a lovely opening scene and some good between level pictures. Also there is a 2-player simultaneous mode to spice things up a bit. But in the final analysis, there isn't much to really make you want to come back to this game and it certainly can't compete with the 'Soldier' series. Competent but lacking imagination.

The cabinet supported up to two players (though two cabinets could be "linked" for four-player), where each player would control one of four classes much like Gauntlet. The game uses a side-scrolling perspective, and characters can become stronger by defeating enemies and leveling up, or finding and purchasing items. There was also a non-linear element to the game, allowing the player to return to past locations with keys they found for additional items.Cadash was also adapted for the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis. The Genesis version reduces the number of characters to choose from to just two, removing the Priestess and Ninja/Rogue. Both console versions allow for two players (using the TurboTap accessory for the TG-16 version). The Arcade version determined the length of time the player could spend on the game with a strict time limit, rather than waiting for the player to game over naturally. As well as by spending more money, this time limit could be extended with special items found in-game, and a special spell that only the Priestess can use.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player, as one of four classes, pass through largely linear 2D side-scrolling stages full of monsters and traps. The game is similar to Nintendo's Zelda II, as it combines a standard platformer/action game with RPG elements; as monsters are defeated, experience is added to the character's meter and they'll eventually level up, gaining more health and doing more damage. Ideally, the player should be leveling up at a rate to match the increased difficulty of the monsters.ClassesThe player can choose from one of four classes (the latter two are unavailable on the Sega Genesis version):Fighter: A burly fighter that takes on monsters at close range and has the highest defense and attack strength as well as the second highest speed. He's disadvantaged against ranged creatures, and needs to purchase a shield to block their attacks.Wizard: A versatile spell-caster that is very slow and weak, but can launch all manner of offensive ranged spells at foes, making him very effective at a distance and especially against bosses. He also levels up the fastest. He is disadvantaged against undead foes, which are inexplicably immune to his magic, forcing him to rely on weak physical attacks with his staff.Priestess: A female spell-caster who focuses on defensive and utilitarian magic. She has a decent range of stats and her protective skills make her an easy character to play as. She's also the only character able to increase the timer in the Arcade version. She is disadvantaged by her limited offensive capabilities, which means she has the most trouble against bosses and other tough creatures.Ninja/Rogue: Called a Ninja in the Arcade version, and a Rogue in the TurboGrafx-16 version, he is the fastest and deadliest character at a range. Unlike the magic-users, he can use his range attacks immediately without selecting it from a menu first, and his damage output and speed makes him very powerful against bosses and most enemies in the game. His disadvantage is that he takes the longest to level up, making him less effective in the mid-game as the other characters edge ahead in health and other stats.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Password[CR]Enter any player's name as TORU to start with 20 Experience and past the first boss.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Password[CR]Enter any player's name as AGAG to start with 20 Experience and further into the game.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action, RPG</genre>		<studio>Working Designs</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.5</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>8195</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588919-cadash</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/cadash</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cadash/3030-18068/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10287</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2369911-genesis_cadash_none.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79157-cadash-turbografx-16-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79160-cadash-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/249853-cadash-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94329-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94317-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-story.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94318-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro-the-princess.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94319-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro-the-king-and-the-warriors.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94320-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-choosing-your-character.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94321-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-ninja-in-front-of-the-king.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94322-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-palace.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94323-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-nice-view.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94324-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-entered-a-dungeon.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94325-cadash-turbografx-16-screenshot-throwing-shurikens-at-slimes.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/LUfG2aZ.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/8195.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Champion Wrestler (Japan)">		<description>Champion Wrestler (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FChampion%20Wrestler%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="143368" />		<title_clean>Champion Wrestler</title_clean>		<plot>Take to the ring with one of eight characters - push, kick, rebound and trample your opponent in this muscle-bound wrestling title from Taito.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Champion_Wrestler.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Title Screen[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fight against King The Brute[CR]To fight against the hidden boss "King The Brute", win the championship belt in the SINGLES tournament then defend it in the "Defense Match".

As far as 16-bit systems go, the Genesis was always hands down the kind of this arena, thanks to their solid third party software support. In order to combat this, NEC delivered a few sports titles that were specifically aimed at the American market. Unfortunately, Champions Forever Boxing just goes to show why the TurboGrafx always lagged behind in the sports genre.[CR]In an attempt to reel in the U.S. consumers, NEC threw in a number of former heavyweight champion boxers. These include the likes of Ali, Frazier, and Foreman. As can be expected, there are also a number of imaginery boxers. Although a friend of mine tried to point out that the game was racist, due to its almost complete lack of white boxers, it's not really all that easy to think of a lot of great white boxers over the past few decades. Besides, I'm sure that it would be easy to make the opposite argument for games like TV Sports Hockey.[CR]Anyway, the first thing that jumps out at you about the game is its gut-wrenching hip hop soundtrack. If nothing else, it's almost certain to have you rolling on the floor with laughter after a minute or two. Just based upon the entertainment factor of the theme song alone, I had to boost the sound score a bit, since it more than makes up for the sub-standard boxing sound effects.[CR]If you're looking for great graphics, you had best look elsewhere. Although the sprites are fairly large, they come across as a bit on the stiff side, as you maneuver your boxer around the screen. The rough gameplay doesn't help matters either, as it can really be frustrating to try to land some of the more effective punches. However, NEC should be applauded for the fifteen year career mode that is included with the game. I'm guessing that it was one of the first of it's kind.[CR]Overall, Champions Forever Boxing was a bit of a disappointment. If the truth be told, it doesn't even measure up to the majority of 8-bit boxing games, let alone the rest of it's 16-bit competition. The only two ways that I could really recommend picking up a copy would be if you are a collector or if you can find a copy for a few bucks so that you can enjoy the quirky soundtrack.[CR]Reviewer: Fabio[CR]http://www.turbografx.net/softdetail.asp?soft_id=2[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Carl Kasians Career Passwords[CR]Here are the passwords for Carl Kasian in Career Mode.

To stop him you must work through 550 rounds, clearing them by placing four different coloured balls into the appropriately-coloured hole.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft Company</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>2.4</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>8198</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579587-chew-man-fu</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/chew-man-fu</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/chew-man-fu/3030-1452/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10667</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8198-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8198-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110954-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-menu-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110956-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-good-advice.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110957-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-level-1-notice-that-the.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110958-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-pushing-the-red-block.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110959-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-thanks.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110960-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-is-he-coming-onto-me.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110961-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-red-spot-in-the-middle.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110951-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-out-of-time.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110952-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-and-you-ll-need-to.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110953-chew-man-fu-turbografx-16-screenshot-starting-arrangement.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/w3pWkQW.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Chibi Maruko-chan -

Defeating this boss allows the player to progress to the next stage.[CR]The hero is clearly modeled on Kung Fu legend Bruce Lee, though the game has no obvious references to any of his films.

There are ones that rely purely on your mental abilities and there are others that throw in an arcade element to them. Circus Lido is more the latter, looking like some strange insectoid son of Bubble Bobble. You play a squat green lizard and your aim is to clear the screen of bugs. To do this, you have a long pink tongue that shoots out to swallow any critters in your way, you then have to spit them out into the gaping maws of hungry plants dotted around the level.[CR]But being a lizard, you are seemingly unable to jump, so to navigate your way around, you have a tail that shoots upwards to catch on to any grippable areas of platform above. And to make things harder, there are certain sections of floor that can be slid left or right by pushing up when over the appropriate arrowed block.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Circus Lido is a fairly appealing arcade puzzler. The emphasis is slightly more on puzzle than arcade and now and again you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out how on earth to get to a certain place on screen. The visuals are pretty - well drawn backdrops and nice sprites and the music is suitable enough and doesn't get on your nerves. It's not as mind melting as something like Sokoban and there is no time limit to the levels, giving you room to consider your moves carefully. In all, pretty good puzzle fun.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- Boss stage -[CR]Enter ZYMA as the password.

The story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a young man with a mysterious past, who founds the City Hunter team in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The City Hunter is an underground private detective agency, which takes care of particularly dangerous cases. In the game, the player is able to play through three of such cases, which are unrelated to each other and can be played in any order. [CR]The gameplay is essentially that of a side-scrolling shooter. The player navigates Ryo through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is rather simple, without power-ups or different weapons, and with one items possible to carry at a time. The levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game also reveals mild adventure elements: often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.</plot>		<releasedate>2/3/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>SunSoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<videoid>kCNDVh21UiQ</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18402</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588927-city-hunter</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/city-hunter</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/city-hunter/3030-51973/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10312</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18402-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807261-cityhunter001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807260-city_hunter_%28j%29-008.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807259-city_hunter_%28j%29-007.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807258-city_hunter_%28j%29-006.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807257-city_hunter_%28j%29-005.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807255-city_hunter_%28j%29-003.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807254-city_hunter_%28j%29-002.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2807253-city_hunter_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/1/4/gfs_5027_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/8/9/gfs_5027_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/KI16LxM.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Columns (Japan)">		<description>Columns (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FColumns%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="58641" />		<title_clean>Columns</title_clean>		<plot>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.[CR]As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Vs Mode[CR]You need a second controller for this to work.

Each stage consists of a maze filled with various enemies and items. You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy.[CR]You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.[CR]The Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends. The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen, which also saw a modified Famicom version called Booby Kids.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Normal levels[CR]Press Run on the title screen and select Password.

Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.[CR]Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.[CR]Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</plot>		<releasedate>12/10/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Adventure, RPG</genre>		<studio>Tonkinhouse</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>23256</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588935-cyber-knight</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/cyber-knight</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cyber-knight/3030-19939/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23256-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/5/8/28458_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94245-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen-and-some.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94243-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94244-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-your-ship.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94242-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-in-a-dungeon.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94246-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-information-about-a-planet.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94247-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-talking-to-your-crew.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94248-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-character-stats.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94249-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-lounge.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94250-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-party-management.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94251-cyber-knight-turbografx-16-screenshot-medical-center.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Daichi-kun Crisis - Do Natural (Japan)">		<description>Daichi-kun Crisis - Do Natural (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDaichi-kun%20Crisis%20-%20Do%20Natural%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="235435" />		<title_clean>Daichi-kun Crisis - Do Natural</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Daichikun Crisis: Do Natural is a 1989 PC Engine game that follows a family of cow anthropomorphs as they cultivate their home of Moo Cow Island. It uses a real-time strategy format where players explore the island and plant various crops. They must also fight off the occasional monster attack from the nearby volcanos, and clear the resulting toxic ash away.[CR]The game is thought to be derived from an educational kid's TV show about agriculture shown in the Hokkaido region. Fans have observed the similarity of Daichikun's family and companions and those featured in the TV show, and the similar theme of farming in a harsh climate.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls the oldest son of the family, the titular Daichikun, and his family members Hokkaido (grandpa), Suzuran (mama), Oozora (little brother), Marimo (little sister) and their friends Goro the bear and Alice the crow are all AI controlled and will follow the player until they find themselves a task to complete. Daichikun can use the flying "Geiger No" vehicle to move around and clear ash away quickly, though it cannot attack.[CR]Additional factors unlock as the player progresses with the game, like a port town and various power-ups. The game is on a fast seasonal cycle - a minute represents a month - and various crops do better (or worse) depending on the time of the year.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Last Stage Password[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Japanese characters (format is Row #, Column #):</plot>		<releasedate>22/11/1989</releasedate>		<genre>Strategy, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Salio</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579507-daichikun-crisis-do-natural</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/daichikun-crisis-do-natural/3030-51719/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802457-0923353506-41772.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802464-diachikuncrisis001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802463-daichikun_crisis_do_natural_%28j%29-006.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802462-daichikun_crisis_do_natural_%28j%29-005.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802461-daichikun_crisis_do_natural_%28j%29-004.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802460-daichikun_crisis_do_natural_%28j%29-003.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802459-daichikun_crisis_do_natural_%28j%29-002.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2802458-daichikun_crisis_do_natural_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/f/a/gfs_20848_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/2/a/gfs_20848_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/9/a/gfs_20848_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Daisenpuu (Japan)">		<description>Daisenpuu (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDaisenpuu%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="217925" />		<title_clean>Daisenpuu</title_clean>		<plot>Daisenpuu is an Action game, developed by Toaplan and published by NEC Interchannel,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>		<studio>Toaplan</studio>		<videoid>2UtUhHexjms</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579912-daisenpuu</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/7/7/42177_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/7/a/gfs_19911_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/a/a/gfs_19911_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/1/a/gfs_19911_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/0/a/gfs_19911_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/b/a/gfs_19911_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/6/a/gfs_19911_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/d/a/gfs_19911_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/7/gfs_19911_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/3/7/gfs_19911_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/7/gfs_19911_2_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Darius Alpha (Japan)">		<description>Darius Alpha (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDarius%20Alpha%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="223840" />		<title_clean>Darius Alpha</title_clean>		<plot>One of the rarest games for the PC Engine, Darius Alpha was only offered to those who bought both the CD and HuCard versions of Darius Plus (Which doesn't make much sense, considering how similar the two versions are).

You start out with an unequipped ship and must take down the boss of the first level, King Fossil.

Gameplay is fairly traditional with power-ups increasing the damage of your forward shots and bombs.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Darius Plus is a nice, but drawn out, horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up. Darius has always had a style of it's own and that is much of where its appeal lays. The bosses are very original and have some quite impressive detail and the levels are generally attractive, if repetitive.[CR]The only trouble with the Darius games is that once you lose your weapons, you may as well kiss your whole game goodbye as it can be very difficult to recover. So one for the die hard shoot 'em up fans only. A special note should go to the music which is unusual and a bit of an acquired taste, but great.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- Continue game -[CR]At the title screen, press select[CR]- Select Difficulty Level -[CR]On the title screen press SELECT while holding I and II[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Darius_Plus.htm[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>NEC Interchannel</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.0</rating>		<videoid>DMfjdKKZjeA</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>27093</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588937-darius-plus</gamefaqs_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10309</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/27093-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/27093-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27093-8.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/b/f/gfs_4146_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/6/f/gfs_4146_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/JpdZAEB.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Darkwing Duck (USA)">		<description>Darkwing Duck (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDarkwing%20Duck%20%28USA%29.zip" size="374062" />		<title_clean>Darkwing Duck</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Darkwing Duck, or Disney's Darkwing Duck, is a platformer for the TurboGrafx-16 developed by Interactive Designs and based on the Disney animated TV show.

Upon investigation, it is discovered that the comet was actually an alien spacecraft, setting the stage for the game. [CR]Dead Moon was later released for the Virtual Console on June 4, 2007. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The first scene of Dead Moon[CR]As a traditional side-scrolling shoot 'em up, there isn't much that differentiates Dead Moon from other shooters of the time (which was why it wasn't well-received). The main difference between Dead Moon and other shoot 'em ups are the power-ups, which are structured slightly differently. Upgrade ships will appear from either the bottom or the top of the screen. There are four types of upgrades, organized by color. Red is a circular spread shot, blue is a straight laser beam, green is a vertical wave beam, and yellow is the standard beam. If the player picks up one color, and then picks up another of the same, then it will upgrade it. However, if the player picks up one color, and then a different color, the second color will overwrite the other one. [CR]Other than that, Dead Moon is fairly standard. Bombs act similarly to other games, whereas the player starts with three bombs. Each colored upgrade past the upgrade limit will add a single bomb to the count. Lives are never awarded (the player starts with two). Rather, when the ship gets hit, the power level of the current weapon is lowered by one. [CR]Upon completion of the game's six levels, the scenes restart. The player is presented with a harder version of the game, where enemies can take more damage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]When starting a new stage, at the "Scene #" screen, press and hold Down + Select until the stage starts.

The goal of the game is to make one's way past the hordes of fish and other aquatic life to the end of each stage, where a boss awaits.[CR]Deep Blue has a few interesting features, such as the player's health regenerating if they stop shooting and various weapon power-ups that have individual upgraded variants. The player is constantly beset with schools of fish and other marine life, so staying out of the way and regenerating health is often as valid a strategy as swimming through the enemies guns blazing. The ship's health is indicated by the color of its window, which changes from blue to green to yellow to red as the ship incurs damage.[CR]The game's VGM, rather than being upbeat like in many shooters, is instead atmospheric and melancholy.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>Turbo Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<videoid>SF7y3q7MJ70</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5662</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588941-deep-blue</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/deep-blue</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/deep-blue/3030-34389/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/12482</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5662-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5662-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716414-deepblue001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1727820-gfs_88236_3_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1727819-gfs_88236_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1727818-gfs_88236_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/4/2/gfs_4954_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/4/d/gfs_88236_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/d/0/gfs_88236_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/6/4/gfs_88236_3_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/HDS7jxZ.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Deep Blue - Kaitei Shinwa (Japan)">		<description>Deep Blue - Kaitei Shinwa (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDeep%20Blue%20-%20Kaitei%20Shinwa%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="115182" />		<title_clean>Deep Blue - Kaitei Shinwa</title_clean>		<plot>You command an A.N.G.E.L.

Let's be honest...I used to drool over video game magazine ads for that one and was gravely disappointed when I finally got to give it a shot. That's not what I'm talking about, though. One area that the TurboGrafx had cornered for craptastic games was boxing. For those of you that haven't had the honor of giving Champions Forever Boxing a play, consider yourself fortunate. That game featured perhaps the worst ever video game theme music and was undoubtedly the worst boxing game that I've ever played. With this in mind, one has to ask the question "Are there any decent boxing games on the TurboGrafx?"[CR]It was with that question in mind that I first dove into Naxat's Digital Champ. Naxat does have an impressive resume, being the authors of the Alien Crush series of pinball games. However, would this translate into a quality boxing game? I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised.[CR]Digital Champ is a definite upgrade over Champions Forever Boxing. Although it doesn't have the big name stars that CFB brought to the table, it does feature some opponents that have surprisingly similar appearances to celebrity boxers. Your first opponent looks very much like Rocky, although he doesn't bring much in the way of competition to the party.[CR]Graphics in this title are decent, although not spectacular. The opponents are rather large sprites and are fairly well animated. This game seems fairly similar to the old Punchout arcade game in my mind. You only see your character's gloves throughout the game. I'm not really sure that I'm a big fan of this perspective, but Naxat did a good job of pulling it off.[CR]Music, although fair, is nothing to write home about. I found myself questioning whether there was any background music at all after playing the game, but at least that means that I wasn't overly annoyed by it. The sound effects are somewhat sub par, including some muffled voices.[CR]When it comes to gameplay, I found Digital Champ to be somewhat frustrating. I felt that it was awkward to move around or to block punches. This did improve with some practice, but I just didn't feel that the controls were as sharp as they could have been. Not only that, but the behind the boxer viewpoint just doesn't lend itself to a multi-player mode, and as such, this is only a one player game.[CR]After all of that, you're probably thinking that I'm really down on Digital Champ. However, I found it to be a breath of fresh air compared to Champions Forever Boxing. Although the controls aren't totally dead-on, punching does work pretty decently and it really does payoff to vary between upper cuts and body blows. The opponents seem to get dramatically tougher after the second round, which is another complaint that I have, but overall I find the game to be enjoyable and worth a quick play every once in a while.

One or two players control bearded dwarves as they make their way through fifty platforming and puzzle-like levels in an attempt to save their kidnapped girlfriend.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] typically consists of basic platforming with puzzle elements, usually stemming from proper use of power-ups and special abilities than can even lead to secret areas. The game consists of five worlds, with ten single-screen levels in each plus a boss at the end. Throughout the levels there are also various enemies which can be dealt with by smashing them with the dwarves' hammer. Enemies squished by the hammer can then be picked up and used as deadly projectiles to take out other foes. Once all enemies have been cleared, the player can then move onto the next level.[CR]Powerups[CR]Power-up items can often appear in the center of stages and give a boost to the player in the form of extra power, speed, weapons, instant death of enemies and a slow-down ability. The amount of power the player has determines how far and powerful they can throw enemies through walls.[CR]Ports and sequels[CR]NES[CR]After the success of the arcade release in 1989, the game was eventually ported over to the Nintendo Entertainment System and TurboGrafx-16 a year later and retained its core gameplay with some minor loss of graphical fidelity.[CR]In 1992, Don Doko Don 2 was released on the Nintendo Entertainment system by Taito in Japan. Unlike the first game, the sequel took the form of a side-scrolling platformer.[CR]In 2006, the game was included in the PC, Xbox and PlayStation 2 compilation Taito Legends 2, making it available to audiences outside of Japan for the first time since its release.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reverse Rounds[CR]On the first stage, get to the middle of the top platform, jump and swing your hammer and you'll see the outline of an invisible bubble.

How did this happen? Naturally, because of Nobita, Doraemon's best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it's Doraemon's job to save them![CR]The game is a traditional platformer; Doraemon's main activities are jumping his way through the levels and eliminating enemies who try to stop him. Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time.[CR]Doraemon can enter different rooms and caves scattered through the levels. Some of them lead to mini-games (finding a correct way through a maze, memory games, etc.), which, in their turn, lead to significant power-ups, such as an extra life. The game has a symmetrical structure: each "world" is divided into four levels, the last one leading to the boss battle, after which Doraemon travels to another world.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]At the title screen, press Up, I, II, Down, II, I, Left, Right, II, I.

It can be known for its fancy graphics, it can be known for its intense action, it can be known for the ability to set a gaming party off, or it can even be known for the fact that it wasn't released on American shores (as was often the case with the TurboGrafx). However, how many games gain noteriety for being foul-mouthed?[CR]NEC Avenue's shoot 'em up, Download, is known for just that. In my opinion, it's too bad that that is what it's most known for, as it's really not all that bad of a shooter that just happens to have a few choice words peppered in between levels. If I were going to buy the game for its language, it would more likely be because it has humerously poor English.[CR]Anyway, Download appears to have some sort of cyberpunk Matrix-like story line to it. Since I can't read a word of Japanese, I will leave that to your imagination. What I will tell you, though, is that the game does have some nicely done anime cut sequences for being a HuCard.[CR]The cut scenes are probably the best that the game has to offer graphically. There are just too many shoot 'em ups on the Turbo for this one to be one of the best looking. However, the levels are nicely varied and the background scrolling is pretty decent. Slowdown is minimal, and I can't really remember much in the way of flicker.[CR]Music and sound effects are solid as well, and I actually found myself taking to some of the theme music. Don't expect anything on the level of Gate of Thunder, but you will be pleasantly surprised in comparison to the beeps and boops of an Atari 2600 title.[CR]The real question that I'm sure you're asking is how does Download separate itself from the plethora of other Turbo shoot 'em ups. It does have a few nice features, in terms of gameplay. First of all, there is a password option, that proves to be really helpful. Most levels have a password, so there's no need to start the game over from the beginning every time. Not only that, but you get to re-select your weapon options between levels. There are two types of primary weapons and three options for the secondary weapon. The choice is not so broad compared to other shooters, but it's nice to have a choice between levels.[CR]Other than that, Download throws you right into some intense action from the start. As a shoot 'em up fan, I personally was not disappointed. Although I wouldn't put it among the best of this genre, I would say that it's definitely worth a look if you're a fan of shoot 'em ups or anime influenced games. Whatever you do, just don't buy it for the language.[CR]Reviewer: Fabio[CR]http://www.turbografx.net/softdetail.asp?soft_id=38[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>NEC Interchannel</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>6.0</rating>		<videoid>502rwzIgYas</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18404</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588949-download</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/down-load-</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/download/3030-49333/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10266</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18404-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/8/1/51681_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482248-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482247-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482249-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-cool-cyberpunk-elements.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482250-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-syd-s-profile.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482251-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-syd-is-having-a-nightmare.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482252-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-wait-a-sec-deva-i-gotta.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482253-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-weapon-selection-screen.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482254-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-first-level-it-was-dark.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482255-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-dawn-was-near-when.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482256-down-load-turbografx-16-screenshot-and-the-first-rays-of-sun.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/uFYXXvn.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Dragon Egg!

If you like these runny-jumpy affairs, this is a pretty good one. You're a teenage girl, and your grandpa (? some old guy) puts a dragon egg in your backpack and sends you on your way.[CR]As you acquire powerups, the egg starts to develop into a dragon. Instead of clubbing enemies with your silly mushroom stick, the fire button will make you swing the backpack with the now-hatched egg in it, and the baby dragon will breathe a little flame at the enemies. Eventually the dragon gets big enough where YOU ride IT, instead of you lugging it around. Fully powered-up, the dragon even has limited flying ability.[CR]You can buy health and items to make the flame breath longer and other junk, at shops along the way.[CR]http://baetzler.de/vidgames/Hu-reviews.var[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]At the title screen, press the following buttons:</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NCS</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>rgBDaveAXDM</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18443</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588950-dragon-egg</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-egg/3030-36191/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10331</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18443-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/9/3/51693_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/1866366-4.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/1866365-3.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/1866364-2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/1866363-1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/f/2/gfs_4984_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/2/2/gfs_4984_1_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/6/f/gfs_4984_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/b/f/gfs_4984_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/b/gfs_4984_3_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/jSuyUlA.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Dragon Saber - After Story of Dragon Spirit (Japan)">		<description>Dragon Saber - After Story of Dragon Spirit (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDragon%20Saber%20-%20After%20Story%20of%20Dragon%20Spirit%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="327314" />		<title_clean>Dragon Saber - After Story of Dragon Spirit</title_clean>		<plot>Whereas  Dragon Spirit was a multi-format conversion, only Turbo-Grafx / PC Engine users got to play the lesser-known sequel at home. Gameplay-wise, little has changed from the original, as both games are vertically-scrolling shoot 'em ups putting you in control of a dragon. You are flying over built-up land, complete with rivers and their banks. The enemies and waves can be shot or avoided - shooting them reveals extra points as well as the occasional power-up. Ground units are shooting at you but can't be shot back, so be careful which parts of the screen you occupy at which times.</plot>		<releasedate>27/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Namco Limited</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<videoid>z1Scqjrgmfc</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588952-dragon-saber</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit/3030-5564/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/12481</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1379134-dragon_saber_flyer.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/9/1/51691_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116774-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116770-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116771-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116772-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116773-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116769-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116775-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116776-dragon-saber-after-story-of-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/f/8/gfs_3685_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/1/f/gfs_109303_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/zEitieW.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Dragon Spirit (USA)">		<description>Dragon Spirit (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDragon%20Spirit%20%28USA%29.zip" size="160726" />		<title_clean>Dragon Spirit</title_clean>		<plot>When bringing a console overseas, the system manufacturer always has to face the daunting task of choosing titles that it thinks will be best received on American shores. The PC Engine had a very eclectic mix of titles to offer for the TurboGrafx. As history proved, some of those titles proved to be well-suited to the North American market and others were not. One of the better titles among this batch may very well have been Dragon Spirit.[CR]Namco has been known for making quality games for many years, dating back to the days of Pac Man. They were the brains behind this title as well, and I must say that they did very nicely for such an early title on the console. The game is an overhead vertically scrolling shooter. You play the role of a dragon that faces a seemingly endless onslaught of enemies. There's no shortage of challenge here, and shooter fans are likely to be pleased.[CR]Graphics for this game are fairly simple, and it is easy to see that the game was released before the console's capabilities had truly been put to the test. The two biggest pluses for visuals are the fact that flicker is pretty much non-existant and that the boss enemies are very large sprites. The music is very well done for a HuCard. Each level has a different tune and you'll likely find that they don't wear too thin like some other titles from the same era. Sound effects were also well handled for a HuCard title, with dragon sound effects so real that you'll swear that you're right in the game.[CR]The gameplay is very responsive, as you would hope it would be with a shooter. One interesting twist that adds a new dimension to the game is that there are ground enemies and airborne enemies. Each type of enemy can only be defeated with the associated type of attack. This can make for some particularly interesting battles. Besides that, the power-up system is well-implemented. Your dragon can grow up to three heads when a special icon is captured. This leads me to wonder if perhaps the power-ups are radioactive or originate from some place where the water is not safe for drinking. Despite this concern, the extra heads to turn out to be surprisingly useful when fighting off some very belligerent and persistent foes.[CR]Dragon Spirit is a classic TurboGrafx title that should not be overlooked. Although I'm hesitant to say that it is as much of a staple as Bonk's Adventure or Keith Courage, I would have to say that few collections would be complete without it. As with most of the launch titles, it is readily available and can be had for cheap. With that in mind, is there really any reason why you don't own this title aside from a possible extreme distaste for shooters (in which case I must ask why you have bothered to read so far into the review)?[CR]Reviewer: Fabio[CR]http://www.turbografx.net/softdetail.asp?soft_id=23[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1988</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>NEC</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<videoid>8YT5Ckpqm5Q</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5666</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588953-dragon-spirit</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/dragon-spirit</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-spirit/3030-20897/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10291</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2365528-tg16_dragonspirit.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5666-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/113900-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218281-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115695-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115696-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot-game-start.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115697-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot-early-action-wave.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115698-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot-flying-over-a-land.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115699-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot-a-river-runs-through.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115700-dragon-spirit-turbografx-16-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712326-dragonspirit001.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712324-dragon_spirit_%28u%29-004.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712323-dragon_spirit_%28u%29-003.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712322-dragon_spirit_%28u%29-002.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/ksqdJGr.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Dragon's Curse (USA)">		<description>Dragon's Curse (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDragon%27s%20Curse%20%28USA%29.zip" size="169752" />		<title_clean>Dragon's Curse</title_clean>		<plot>Life as a roaming adventurer is never easy. One minute you're shoving several feet of cold steel between the gaping jaws of some evil robot dragon, and the next thing you know, you've been transformed into a fire breathing lizard man. Such is the problem that you first encounter at the beginning of Adventure Island, Hudson Soft's conversion of the Master System game 'Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'. Taking more of its influence from the second game in the Wonder Boy series than the first, Adventure Island has a more balanced structure and more exploratory gameplay.[CR]The main game is centred around a small village which acts as a sort of 'hub' to the surrounding levels. Each of these levels are gradually accessed over time with the acquisition of keys or new transformations. As the game progresses, you will find yourself transforming into five different creatures, which can (and need to) be switched between in special rooms. The lizard is the basic transformation and does little more than breathe fire at any passing fauna. Mouse man is a tiny little critter and aside from being able to fit under small obstacles, he can also run up and around special chequered walls and ceilings. Next up is a green amphibian that gives you the power to swim around freely, followed by a tiger man who swings his sword around in a wide arc, allowing you to break blocks above and below. Finally, there is the bird transformation which lets you fly around by repeatedly tapping the jump button.[CR]As you progress, your quest will take you over many types of terrain from jungle to desert to the inside of a giant pyramid - but to help you out there is a password/backup save feature in a church in the main village. As you viciously hack up the cute little inhabitants of the island, you find that they considerately drop money and helpful items for you. The money is used in shops to upgrade your armour, or buy healing at the hospital, while the other items are special weapons that can be set from the pause menu. These include homing fireballs, ground based mini whirlwinds and arrows that shoot directly upwards (and are a blessing when you are trying to get rid of flame-dropping clouds).[CR]COMMENT:[CR]While not the hardest of games to complete, the platform action is very enjoyable while it lasts, and the wise move to give this a less linear feel works well - there is enough incentive to try and unlock the next level or transformation and this keeps you playing. While the graphics are a little sparse and not much of a step up from their Master System equivalents, they are well drawn and cute enough not to complain about. The sound is fine, if a little soft, but the tunes are catchy and easy to listen to. If you're looking for a platform adventure that doesn't start you from level one every time you play, then you could do a lot worse than this.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- play as a human -[CR]enter password "M0DE

In the US, the game was published by NEC directly, as was the case for many TurboGrafx-16 games. It was also added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. [CR]The story of Drop Off is to rescue a girl, Izumi, from a nightmare that is keeping her in a coma. A magical being called Muse helps Izumi's companion to fight the demons within her dream.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a Breakout clone that also borrows elements of Taito's Bust-A-Move. Various fruits start slowly moving down the screen in bunches; in order to remove them (touching them with the paddle is instant death) the player must use the ball to bash the fruit and remove them. If the player removes a fruit that is the sole link connecting two groups of fruit, the lower group will all fall at the same time. The player is best served by removing these lynch pins to make things easier on themselves. The player also has a protective shield that stops the ball leaving the screen, but this shield will eventually vanish if hit enough times by the ball.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC, Data East</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>DU7H0l1YVWk</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8206</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588954-drop-off</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/drop-off</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/drop-off/3030-20899/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/1790468-drop_off__u_.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/0/4/51704_back.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218280-drop-off-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/518281-drop-off-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro-explains-the-plot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/518278-drop-off-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/518279-drop-off-turbografx-16-screenshot-her-first-dream-is-about.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/518280-drop-off-turbografx-16-screenshot-and-then-the-watermelons.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716429-drop_rock_hora_hora_%28j%29-010.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716428-drop_rock_hora_hora_%28j%29-009.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716427-drop_rock_hora_hora_%28j%29-008.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716426-drop_rock_hora_hora_%28j%29-007.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716425-drop_rock_hora_hora_%28j%29-006.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716424-drop_rock_hora_hora_%28j%29-005.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Druaga no Tou (Japan)">		<description>Druaga no Tou (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDruaga%20no%20Tou%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="255186" />		<title_clean>Druaga no Tou</title_clean>	</game>	<game name="Dungeon Explorer (USA)">		<description>Dungeon Explorer (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FDungeon%20Explorer%20%28USA%29.zip" size="252771" />		<title_clean>Dungeon Explorer</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Taken from the TurboGrafx-16 North American Manual, the story for the game is as follows:[CR]The Dungeons of Oddesia Await You[CR]Welcome, adventurer, to a strange land. This is a world of magic, potions, alien masters and hidden dangers. But listen closely now, for you are the last hope of this once peaceful nation.[CR]You are in the land of Oddesia. Summoned by the former king, you have been sent on a mission. Somewhere deep within the ancient dungeons of this broken lies a sacred stone. This "ORA Stone" possesses the powers of life, light and happiness. Long ago, before the attack of the alien race that conquered and now rules this land, it was hidden deep within these caverns. The aliens still rule Oddesia with terror and violence. Strange and dangerous creatures occupy the underground labyrinth of the dungeons, wherein lies the stone. The alien King, Natas, himself searches for the Stone. He promises death to anyone that stands in his way.[CR]Your mission is to find the ORA Stone, return it to Oddesian people and restore peace to the land. But beware! The alien knows of your mission and are determined to stop you. If you must venture alone, then go! But hear my words, brave soldier. Consider gathering your friends in this gallant quest. Help each other to reach the ORA Stone. The hearts of the Oddesian people go with you! (p. 2)[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dungeon Explorer is a top-down action-adventure game, that has an emphasis on ranged attacks. Before a player (or players, as the game supports up to a maximum of five) starts their adventure, they must choose what class they would like to play as. Initially, the game gives players a choice of eight classes, but two additional characters can be discovered. Players must choose what class best fits their play style, as there are many attributes that need to be considered. Some classes have quicker attacks than others, which is important as weapon speed doesn't change over the course of the game. Some classes are more resilient to poison and others are not. Some magic spells are strong and weak versus certain enemies, while some spells can strengthen certain enemies. Also of consideration are each classes base stats, as it will affect the first few levels of play.[CR]For the actual gameplay, Dungeon Explorer shares many similarities to Gauntlet. From the top-down perspective, players may move and shoot in eight directions, collect magic bottles to activate magic, and fend off hordes of monsters and enemy generators. Many of the dungeons are labyrinthine in design, and harbor dangerous traps to impede players. Unique to Dungeon Explorer, is a situation that occurs if players take too long to destroy an enemy generator. It will release a powerful wisp, that will kill a player on contact. However, while the wisp is powerful, it can still be destroyed if necessary.[CR]During the course of a players adventure through Oddesia, they will have the opportunity to strengthen their character, both temporarily and permanently. Temporary bonuses come in the form of power-ups scattered throughout the game. There is the Ring of Healing that is dropped by certain enemies, which gives players and additional ten hit points, and can go over there maximum amount. There is also the Edge of Attack, which increases attack power, the Crown of Intelligence, which increases magic power, and the Boots of Agility, which increases a characters movement speed. However, if a player dies or quits the game, these bonuses are lost. Permanent stat bonuses are conferred by bosses and two special enemies. When a boss, or special enemy, is defeated, a crystal is left behind. It will cycle through the four stat colors - blue for attack, purple for health and defense, yellow for speed, and green for magic. Depending on what color the crystal is on pick-up, that's the stat bonus received. In addition, players will receive a slight boost to health, and to their magical abilities. Of note is the purple pick-up, which grants a larger health bonus, since it is tied directly to a character's health. Also, once a crystal is collected, it is gone for good. Bosses do not respawn, so players can not infinitely power-up their character. This can cause problems in multiplayer, if one player is farther than the rest, as weaker characters will be at a disadvantage. Another important situation of note occurs during a multiplayer game after a boss fight. A boss will drop one crystal per number of players currently alive (on screen), but a player can only pick up one crystal. This can also cause problems if one player dies right before the boss does. If there are no more lives remaining, or they don't continue in time, they lose out on the crystal bonus.[CR]In addition to stat boosts, players have magic to aid them in their quest. Each class has two magic spells to utilize, one for white magic, and the other for black. Running the gamut from healing, defense up, antidote, time stop, and warp for white magic, and attack up, area of effect damage, and music changing for black magic. Some characters have overlapping spells, while others have unique abilities. To use a magic spell, players must collect white and black magic pick-ups from defeated enemies. Players can hold a maximum of nine for each. Of special note is the behavior of some magic spells. For healing and augmenting spells, some have an area of effect around the caster. Other times, players must be touching the caster to make use of it's effects.[CR]Dungeon Explorer uses a password system to record a player's progress. Once a player uses up their last Seed of Life, the game ends, and is returned to the title screen. When a player continues (or starts) their game, they are placed back at the inn, and may either resume their quest, or talk to the king to receive one stock of white and black magic.[CR]In addition to the main quest, the game has a combat arena, where players can partake in a deathmatch. In one of the side-rooms of the main castle, player attacks hurt each other (they do not anywhere else in the game), and the last one surviving after all Seeds of Life have been used is the winner. That player may then continue on their quest alone, or reset the game and play it again. Players may use built up characters in the arena.[CR]Player Characters[CR]The Fighter.Fighter - emphasis on attack, defense, and health.

In it, an ambitious sorcerer by the name of Phades kills the king of Oddesia, seizes the ORA Stone, and plunges the kingdom into chaos. Phades then returns the ORA Stone to the sinister Natas, and it's up to the heroes of Oddesia to recover the stone and set things right. Dungeon Explorer II plays nearly identical to the original, except with more content.[CR]Another game was created for the Sega CD in 1995, that is different than both DE and DEII. Simply called Dungeon Explorer, the Sega CD version allows players to buy new equipment, level up through the acquisition of experience points, and manage a diminishing health counter, much like Gauntlet. The gameplay, however, is still very similar to Dungeon Explorer, although taking place in a different setting with different characters.[CR]The SNES also saw a DE game, called Crystal Beans: From Dungeon Explorer in 1995. For the most part, the traditional gameplay is intact, but it loses the multiplayer. This version features midi versions of the DEII soundtrack.[CR]In 2007, the DS and PSP saw a revival of the series, with two different versions of Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts. Both feature radically different gameplay systems and entirely different settings from each other and from the original. The only mechanics that were kept from the original is the emphasis on ranged attacks, though the DS and PSP versions have incorporated melee attacks to compliment it.[CR]The original title is currently available via the Wii's Virtual Console. It was announced at CES 2011 that the title would be available for the PlayStation Network in February 2011.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Homing Attacks[CR]Start your game, doesn't matter how many players.

The game has something of a Metroid feel to it - not only in the weird and occasionally disgusting monster design, but also in that Energy will often require a bit of backtracking for necessary items before progress can be made.[CR]The game is based on a PC-88 game from Quasar Soft named Ashe. Besides the big improvements to graphic and audio quality, the games seem functionally identical.[CR]Energy was widely regarded by critics at the time as being one of the worst PC Engine games. The game is plagued with coding issues (such as very slow transitions between screens) and the requirements to proceed are often inscrutable. It does have something of a cult following to this day, however.

It would see a PC Engine conversion the following year published by the system's co-creators NEC. The game uses a top-down perspective similar to the F1 Circus franchise and allows the player to customize their vehicle between races depending on how much money they earned. It features the likenesses of various famous F1 racers at the time, though their names have been slightly altered to avoid copyright issues.[CR]The PC Engine version of the game added a story mode, which presents the player as a fledgling F1 driver hoping to win fame and fortune on circuits across the world. The player has to hire mechanics to work on their car before they start investing in upgrades, boosting aspects like the tire strength and engine power.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] F3000 Time Trial Password[CR]At the password screen, enter the following password.

Upgrades are bought from shops appearing in the world as red balloons with the word shop on them. All the power-ups are temporary, but are powerful enough to be of considerable help when clearing the larger enemies needed to progress to the stage's boss.[CR]Fantasy Zone was originally an Arcade game but was ported to several consoles, not just those made by Sega. The gameplay was mostly the same in all versions, but the graphic quality varied depending on the platform.[CR]The 1986 Sega Master System version is the first SMS game to be released in the standard cartridge format, rather than the Super Card format the system had used up until that point. The cartridge allowed for a lot more memory, and Fantasy Zone was able to exploit this feature. The Famicom version is an official port by Sunsoft but the US NES version is an unlicensed Tengen release. The game was also released on the TurboGrafx-16 as well as appearing in multiple Sega compilations for more powerful systems.Virtual Console[CR]The Master System port of Fantasy Zone was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 11th 2008 in Japan, April 11th in Europe and April 14th in the US.3D Classics[CR]In March 2014, Sega released a 3D Classics version on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as part of the second run of Sega 3D Classics remastered to be displayed in stereoscopic 3D for the platform.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]Pause the game and enter this code:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]While playing, pause the game and press Button I, Button II 2 times, Up 3 times, Down 4 times, Right 5 times, Left 6 times.

The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer.[CR]There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest.  Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship.  There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1.  Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.[CR]Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin.  This is essentially a racing RPG.  You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion.  To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car.

Alice can move left or right via the D-pad; she can also jump. She has several means of offense. As is common in many platformers, she can jump on top of most enemies to squish them. In addition, she can shout " &#12452;&#12516; " (iya/no) at enemies; this can be charged up for up to three levels of power, resulting in a bigger "iya". Alice can get out of breath if you shout too much, though. There are also several types of magic at Alice's disposal.[CR]MAGIC: These are the spells Alice can use. Alice begins with red magic; the others are found later in the game.Red Magic: Red magic, when activated, can make hidden items visible.Blue Magic: Alice's jumping height is greatly increased while this is active. This is obtained for clearing the Forest.Green Magic: Alice summons a switch and presses it, causing an earthquake which damages all enemies on-screen. This is obtained for completing the Falls.Silver Magic: Alice becomes invincible to enemy hits for a limited period. She can still die from falling in holes, though! Unlike the first three magics, this costs two MP to cast. Obtained for completing the Vegetables.Gold Magic: Alice summons a Djinn from a lamp and it attacks all enemies for a period of time. It's very powerful. This costs 3 MP to cast, and is obtained for completing the Palace.[CR]ITEMS: These are the items Alice finds throughout the game. Note that any stat boosts only apply for that stage; they don't carry over to the next.Small Mr. Heart: Restores 1 point of Alice's life.Big Mr. Heart: Refill's Alice's life meter and adds an additional heart to it!Mr. Glove: Restores one point to Alice's magic meter.Magic Book: Refill's Alice's magic meter and adds an additional stock!Iya: Adds an additional bar of power to Alice's "iya" meter, allowing her to shout even stronger "iyas" at enemies.1up: An extra life.Crystal: worth 5000 bonus points.[CR][B]Storyline:[/B][CR]Alice is a simple country girl who loves fairy stories. One night while she was sleeping, she had a very strange dream. A white rabbit appeared, and begged for Alice's help; the dream world has been conquered by Mammon, and only Alice can restore peace and save the inhabitants of dream world! How can she refuse?[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Secret spooking![CR]WORLD 1: THE FOREST[CR]Stage 1: Alice begins her journey in the dream world through a forest, punctuated by occasional caves. The boss is a series of ghosts that live in a candy house. Maybe there's a secret down the chimney...?[CR]Stage 2: Alice continues in the forest., through an area much the same as the first stage. For some reason, fish skeletons serve as ladders in the forest. This time the boss is an alligator who, once again, lives in a candy house.[CR]Stage 3: The third stage of the forest. It's much the same. The boss is "Dangerous Pinocchio"; he is moderately more difficult than what Alice has faced so far. Alice rescues Cinderella after his defeat.The tuba dog.[CR]WORLD 2: THE FALLS[CR]Stage 1: The falls area is, perhaps expectedly, full of flowing water. Eventually, Alice arrives at a castle only to encounter the gang of Ghosts from the Forest world. They have an extra member in their ghostly gang this time, but are still no real threat.[CR]Stage 2: Alice begins this stage scaling a waterfall patrolled by dangerous teddybears named Pooh. The alligator makes a return this time, and although he's a little tougher, he's much the same.[CR]Stage 3: More waterfalls and castles, and plenty of fish and seals to boot. Using the blue magic makes many parts of this stage much easier. The boss is a tuba-playing dog. Beware his sour notes, they pack a punch! His tuba also shields him from the front AND he shoots a large number of notes, so be patient! Alice rescues Snow White after defeating him.Big carrots.[CR]WORLD 3: THE VEGETABLES[CR]Stage 1: A giant vegetable garden! Alice works her way past overgrown carrots and daikon radishes. There are a lot of enemies in this area... even pelicans try to bomb Alice. At the end Alice encounters the ghostly gang yet again, but they have added yet another member to their masses. Won't they ever give up?[CR]Stage 2: This part of the vegetables is heavily infested with spikey purple lizards. Speaking of lizards, our gator friend is back for more, but this time he has some new tricks up his sleeve, including spitting those balls he's always been spitting half-heartedly before with great force directly at Alice![CR]Stage 3: The climax of the vegetables. The enemies are out in full force! The boss is the Wolf, dressed as Grandma... Who could HE possibly have prisoner? Unsurprisingly, Alice rescues Red Riding Hood in this stage.I don't care what anyone says. Any clown that can do that has talent.[CR]WORLD 4: THE PALACE[CR]Alice is finally here, nearing the end of her journey. But there are still more stages to go! This spooky palace is inhabited by witches, animate candles, clowns, and other frightening enemies. Alice battles the former King of Dream Land here; he has been corrupted by Mammon's power. Defeating him frees him from the spell.[CR]World 5: THE NIGHTMARE[CR]Resembling the palace, the Nightmare incorporates aspects of all the previous worlds in to one major challenge. Eventually Alice arrives in a graveyard; waiting for her is Mammon herself. She starts off by turning in to a snake woman who spews eggs; then she turns in to a much more terrifying monster! Should Alice defeat her, peace will be restored to dream land.

ported to a number of other systems, including the PC Engine. It was the first PC Engine game developed by Masaya, the label used by the NCS (Nippon Computer Systems) corporation, and a precursor to one of their most famous series: Langrisser, occasionally known as Warsong.[CR]The player controls the army of the Land of Light, and has to repel the evil overlord B&#246;ser and his monsters. The player must build their army by spending points/cash earned in the previous battle to acquire new units before the next. In order to maximize the player's chances of victory, they have to defeat as many enemy units as possible without letting them escape while securing their own units' safety to have the most spending money for the following conflict.[CR]The game also has a Construction Mode that allows the player to create their own scenarios with units not found in the main game. These range from sci-fi units to members of Masaya's development team.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes for Campaign Mode[CR]Enter the first four of these codes on the unit selection screen.

It stars the eponymous Genji Agedama, a regular student that is transformed into a costumed super hero whenever the need arises. The game is based on the anime of the same name, which was actually a goofy lampoon of tokusatsu TV shows not unlike Samurai Pizza Cats and other animated superhero shows with that sensibility.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Genji Tsuushin Agedama automatically scrolls to the right in every stage (with a few exceptions) and the player character is constantly running to keep up. Enemies show up along this path, often appearing in shoot 'em up type waves, and the player can either shoot them down with their qi-blast projectile attacks or avoid them. Occasionally, the player will also be required to jump from platform to platform.[CR]The player has a health bar measured in red magatamas - the player initially starts with eight and can occasionally find additional ones after defeating enemies. The player can also collect blue magatamas: this makes an "option" character show up and help Agedama for a while, providing services like increasing his firepower or creating a shield around him. The player can also find rare yellow magatamas which temporarily make him invincible.[CR]In addition to the magatamas the player can find and collect five different-colored orbs that allow Agedama to charge up (by holding down the attack button) and release a special attack. These colored orbs are as follows:Red - A basic fire attack that is more damaging than the regular shot but doesn't extend as far.Blue - A flurry of tornadoes that fly forwards and upwards.Green - A powerful green energy wave.Purple - Summons a trio of genies that fly across the screen and cause damage to everything in their path.Yellow - Bolts of lightning that damage all enemies on the screen.Flashing - When a full gauge is charged for a few seconds longer, the player can unleash a devastating nuke attack that greatly damages all enemies on the screen.[CR]It is also possible to charge the gauge insufficiently to reach one of the orbs, in which case a lesser form of that attack is performed. For instance, holding the charge and releasing just before reaching the purple orb creates a smaller genie that homes in on enemies. Each special attack has their own lesser form.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>13/12/1991</releasedate>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>NEC

The player, as Arthur, must venture into the haunted environs surrounding his hometown of Anoraff to reach the titular mansion and defeat Orb Gamut and his army of undead. He is gifted magical powers via a purple orb, which needs to be regularly refilled as it is Arthur's only means to fight the undead.[CR]The game is an action adventure game in the same manner as the Dizzy games from Codemasters. While the player is expected to leap between platforms and fight monsters, they must also search around for items and solve inventory puzzles before they can continue. They can investigate suspicious areas by pressing up on the D-pad, which can result in an enemy trap or a useful item.

You must find the pieces of your body strewn about each maze-like stage, which increase your size, and use your length to surround items, food, and enemies in order to eliminate them.

Only your snake's head is vulnerable; if an enemy hits your body it will scatter all the pieces and you'll have to collect them again.

Players control a ship called the Vic Viper through multiple space stages. The enemies encountered include a large array of alien ships and creatures which try to collide into the Vic Viper or shoot it down. Luckily, throughout each stage power-ups are collected by shooting down certain color enemies. Power-ups are saved up on a power meter on the bottom of the player's screen. Once a player reaches the power-up cell that they wish to buy, it can be obtained by pressing the select button (NES release). The power-up cells include:Speed Up: Increases the movement speed of the Vic Viper. Missile: Drops missiles to kill ground targets with every shot.Double: Shoots two cannon shots at once rather than one shot.Laser: Replaces the standard cannon shot with a laser beam.Option: Creates a hovering orange ball that follows the Vic Viper doubling its firepower with each Option.?: Provides a  shield on the front of the ship.[CR]At the end of each stage a boss battle takes place where, more often than not, the Vic Viper must shoot at its core to destroy it. Many of these bosses have shields that protect their core that the player must destroy before being able to lay waste to the core itself.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The NES version was the first game to ever include the  Konami code.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>15/11/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami Industry Co.

As the captain of a River Patrol Boat (or a PBR: Patrol Boat, River), a compact armored boat built to traverse Vietnam's many shallow rivers, the player must complete tasks for the US military, often involving the destruction of Viet Cong river encampments and vehicles. Eventually, the Vietnam War ends, and the player character must use their gunboat skills to take on drug cartels in Colombia as well as patrol the Panama Canal.[CR]The game is a strict simulation game, employing first-person views for the boat's navigation and weapons. The player can also assign weapon loadouts before each mission.[CR]Gunboat was originally developed for the Amstrad CPC by Accolade in 1990, before being released for the Commodore Amiga and PC IBM. It eventually saw a TurboGrafx-16 release in 1992, which was developed by The Code Monkeys and published by NEC Interchannel in the US exclusively.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Simulation</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>0.5</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>8208</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588987-gunboat</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/gunboat</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/gunboat/3030-9675/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8208-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8208-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323632-gunboat-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323633-gunboat-turbografx-16-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323634-gunboat-turbografx-16-screenshot-beginning-a-training-mission.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323635-gunboat-turbografx-16-screenshot-selecting-the-boat-s-weapons.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323636-gunboat-turbografx-16-screenshot-shooting.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323637-gunboat-turbografx-16-screenshot-viewing-a-map.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722897-2338882515-DKMcp.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722896-0204806342-EVqUF.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722895-9181372480-bML3u.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722894-5395243175-H3fiG.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Gunhed (Japan)">		<description>Gunhed (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FGunhed%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="203194" />		<title_clean>Gunhed</title_clean>		<plot>Blazing Lazers is an Action game, developed by Compile and published by Hudson,which was released in Japan in 1989.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode[CR]Enable Sound Test cheat.

Released in Japan as Gunhed, this particular ROM is a special edition of that game.[CR]This is a neat little ROM - this was the official game of the 1989 Hudson Travelling Caravan, a traveling gaming contest in Japan not completely unlike the old Blockbuster Championships we had here. Every summer, from 1985 to 1998, Hudson ran contests featuring a different game every year that travelled across Japan. The proper name of these contests was HUDSON ZENKOKU CARAVAN, which literally translates to Hudson's All Japan Caravan.[CR]Like most of the Nintendo World Championship games, this game is identical to the release version with a few new rules added. First off, you only have two options - a two or a five minute game. The game will end at the finish of the chosen time period. The other change this game has from the released version is that you can only play one level of the game. The game begins and ends on the third level and no other levels seem accessable, especially since the stage select has been disabled.[CR]From a playability standpoint, this certainly isn't the most interesting ROM on the page. However, within the last few years as collectors are finishing off their commercially released game collection, games like this start getting more and more valuable. ROMs, while not valuable like the actual cart, do provide us with a method of playing such limited edition games such as this one...[CR]http://my.ais.net/~xtreme/SF/PCEngine/Gunhed_Special/index.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>NEC</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>18410</thegamesdb_id>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18410-1.jpg</boxart1>	</game>	<game name="Hana Taaka Daka!

The player controls the eponymous Hani, a sentient haniwa figurine, as they shoot down legions of demonic spirits and youkai in the air. He is set to this task by ancient Japanese deity Izanagi, with the ultimate goal of rescuing his wife/sister deity Izanami.[CR]The chief feature of Hani in the Sky is the protagonist's ability to change the direction of their weapon, allowing the player to shoot in eight different directions total. This is often required to defeat enemy waves emerging from all sides of the screen as well as the fast-moving bosses. The player can also upgrade Hani's weaponry, allowing him to fire in more directions simultaneously, as well as purchase health refills and other useful items from Izanagi.[CR]Hani in the Sky was eventually followed by a sequel: Hani on the Road. Unlike Sky, Hani on the Road is more of a ground-based action platformer.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>28/2/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>FACE</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>2.6</rating>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/hani-in-the-sky</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/hani-in-the-sky/3030-17587/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2382307-hani_in_the_sky_pce.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323661-hani-in-the-sky-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323662-hani-in-the-sky-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-first-level.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323663-hani-in-the-sky-turbografx-16-screenshot-shooting-downwards.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323664-hani-in-the-sky-turbografx-16-screenshot-surrounded-by-enemies.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2801407-haniinthesky001.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2382310-hani_in_the_sky__j__001.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2382309-hani_in_the_sky__j__002.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2382308-hani_in_the_sky__j__003.png</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Hanii on the Road (Japan)">		<description>Hanii on the Road (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FHanii%20on%20the%20Road%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="188988" />		<title_clean>Hanii on the Road</title_clean>		<releasedate>14/9/1990</releasedate>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/hani-on-the-road/3030-36405/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2566848-7622243348-58899.jpg</boxart1>	</game>	<game name="Hatris (Japan)">		<description>Hatris (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FHatris%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="47601" />		<title_clean>Hatris</title_clean>		<plot>Remember Tetris?

Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<videoid>-p8jg2M8Rio</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8210</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588996-impossamole</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/impossamole</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/impossamole/3030-17648/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/12480</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8210-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/628840-impossamole__gbh____back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323665-impossamole-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323666-impossamole-turbografx-16-screenshot-game-start-attacked-by.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323667-impossamole-turbografx-16-screenshot-throwing-a-box-at-a-camera.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323668-impossamole-turbografx-16-screenshot-this-gun-fires-strange.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722534-0704303688-i0i3N.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722530-1922032151-mmKNa.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722529-1549332344-UdVdA.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/628857-pompey_pirates_menu_disk_33_005.gif</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/628856-pompey_pirates_menu_disk_33_008.gif</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/628853-pompey_pirates_menu_disk_33_009.gif</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/yglGIe0.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="J.

The only way that you can deal with him is by kicking him where it hurts.[CR]Along the way, you can enter doors. Doing this will give you a hint about the level and your vitality will be increased as well. You can kick certain objects such as lamp posts, trashcans, or thin air to obtain coins, or to make hidden platforms appear.

You have this object called a club. You can use the club to whack various balls into the holes conviently located around the 18 holes or so of golf action. This game likes to piss you off by refusing to recognize you hitting the ball, however. I swear I would spend many minutes trying to hit the damn ball, and the damn ball would not move. Then, you have this little meter, but it does not mean anything because the chances are when the meter fills up and you swing you're going to miss the damn ball anyways.[CR]And there is the basic problem I have with most golf games. I can never quite figure out how to play them, because I always miss the damn ball. Unfortunately for Jack Nicklaus and his little game, it was released for the Turbografx 16, which sucks because the Turbografx 16 controller provides little help when it comes to playing this game. In fact, the controller will make you end up hating the game even more than you already will. Golf games almost always suck, and this game is no exception. And yes, that is bias, I am biased against Turbografx games.[CR]The graphics in the game are nothing extraordinary, I would have expected a little more effort been put into the graphics of the game, because the game seems an awful lot, graphically, like some of the golf games released on NES, and that is not supposed to happen because the Turbografx is the more powerful system, dammit! The cool part of the graphics is the title screen, which shows a nice picture of that cheery guy Jack Nicklaus swinging at air, which is proof that this game forces you to miss the ball.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/turbo16/review/R17513.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Accolade</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>8212</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/turbocd/916054-jack-nicklaus-world-golf-tour</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-champions/3030-15139/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/1122277-jack_nicklaus___greatest_18_holes_of_major_championship_golf___front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8212-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115374-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115376-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115377-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115378-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115383-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115379-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115380-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115384-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115381-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/115382-jack-nicklaus-greatest-18-holes-of-major-championship-golf.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/8212.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Jackie Chan (Japan)">		<description>Jackie Chan (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FJackie%20Chan%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="291288" />		<title_clean>Jackie Chan</title_clean>		<plot>Jackie and his sister, Josephine, are tough on tyrants.

To ensure victory, the Gods had to sacrifice part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that had both good and bad in it - the "Evil Holy Sword" Necromancer. The demons were forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven. Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept this plan for co-existence. They have murdered the king of the human continent Ishumeria, and it's time for the nameless hero of this story to seek out the legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world.[CR]Jaseiken Necromancer plays like a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game: top-down navigation, linear story progression, turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies, automatic leveling up, etc. A somewhat unusual (for the time) feature is the player's ability to choose two companions for the hero among six possible ones. These warriors are introduced to the hero after he accepts his quest, and the player can build a party of three, trying to balance between physical and magical skills they possess.[CR]The game is also notable for its rather dark themes, uncommon for the representatives of its genre at that time. Enemies mostly include demonic creatures, and their death animation contains graphical gore.</plot>		<releasedate>22/1/1988</releasedate>		<year>1988</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft Company</studio>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589044-necromancer</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/jaseiken-necromancer</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/jaseiken-necromancer/3030-39859/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2333808-jaseiken_necromancer_pce.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/294997-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/294998-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482345-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-this-head-first.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482346-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-until-he-finally.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482347-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-status-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482348-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-how-can-you.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482349-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-deep-down-i.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482350-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-palace-conference.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482351-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-we-entered-this.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482352-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-i-d-like-a-few.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482353-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-this-is-just.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482354-jaseiken-necromancer-turbografx-16-screenshot-weapons-shop.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Jigoku Meguri (Japan)">		<description>Jigoku Meguri (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FJigoku%20Meguri%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="215684" />		<title_clean>Jigoku Meguri</title_clean>		<plot>Jigoku Meguri is an Action game, developed by ITL and published by Taito Corporation,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>3/8/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>ITL</studio>		<videoid>7S4rF73rHDQ</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18411</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579686-jigoku-meguri</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/jigoku-meguri/3030-12686/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/12488</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18411-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7900/266400-jigoku_moguri.gif</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/8/2/gfs_19932_1_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/1/f/gfs_19932_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/a/b/gfs_19932_3_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/ei0SFES.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Jinmu Denshou (Japan)">		<description>Jinmu Denshou (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FJinmu%20Denshou%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="261352" />		<title_clean>Jinmu Denshou</title_clean>		<plot>Take control of a skilled samurai warrior as you confront all manner of evil spirits in an oriental setting.

Playing either Tasuke (male) or Kyapiko (female), you have to make your way across many levels with just a sword to take down an army of robotic creatures while avoiding floating mines and lava pits. The game is not completely linear, as you start off on a map screen and have to decide which route to take to reach the final boss. This means that you don't have to play every level to win - although certain levels will allow you to obtain special power-up items. One of these (the most important) is the ability to fire a ball of energy from your sword - very useful when timed right as it can take out a whole line of enemies.[CR]The levels are basically of three types - a park, a city and an interior of a factory. Each level is also presented as day or night, giving a limited sort of variety to them and most are fairly short, ending with a boss. This is always either a giant robot (which just involves whacking it as fast as possible) or a flying dragon, which needs a little more skill to defeat. While the park and city levels are similar in structure, the factory tends to be a little more platformy, and requires better timing for all the moving platforms.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Graphically, Schbibin Man is a little rough around the edges, particularly compared with its sequels. Sprites are small and bright, but backgrounds are a little messy. Sound however is excellent. A great title tune and in-game music is made better with some typical Masaya sampled drums. There's also a few snippets of sampled speech.[CR]Despite the fact that this is a pretty simple and not particularly attractive platformer, I really quite enjoy this game. The levels don't spew forth random enemies, so it is possible to learn the enemy patterns and this gives you a certain satisfaction. But mostly, I think I play it for the music. It's not too hard too and worth completing if you can. I can see many people writing this game off at a glance, but don't be too harsh on it and give it a go. Two player simultaneous play is also a nice bonus.[CR]NCS, at the time, was not one of the greatest developers for the PC Engine. Nazo no Masquerade, Gaia no Monsho, Energy. Not exactly titles that fill you with excitement for their newest release. However, Shubibinman was quite a pleasant surprise. Taking control of either Tasuke or Kyapiko, your aim is to make it to the end of each level and defeat the boss. The three types of level are Park, Town &amp; Factory, with bosses usually being a Dragon or a Robot. Once a level's been completed you are sometimes given power ups or the option to buy various health replenishment items or a more powerful 'Shubibin'. Your energy bar is directly linked to your life meter, with your score acting like experience points. You start with a fifty percent bar and it increases ten percent for every twenty thousand points you get.[CR]Graphically the game is about average for that time. There seems to be only one set background for each type of level. For example the town stages seem to be the same recurring buildings in every stage. Although this isn't a major problem, a little bit more variety would have been nice. The sprites, although they only have a couple of frames of animation are well drawn and do the job perfectly. The map screen is as you would expect. Functional with very little flair. This is the only text heavy part of the game but should pose no problem to you. Sound.... Ah yes, the classic NCS drum machines and whiney BGM. But you know what? I LIKE it. It suits the game perfectly. Fair enough, it's not going to be as good as the music to something like Ys, but it matches the graphics - Nothing to write home about, yet not terrible.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is your usual run &amp; jump slasher. Slow paced, but still action packed enough to keep you interested. The enemies are pattern based, so you will get to learn them eventually. The bosses are a disappointment though. Dragon bosses seem to be a case of wait one side and attack, then dodge to the other side of the screen and repeat. Robot bosses are just hack as fast as possible and try to not get hit. Two player mode is simultaneous and gives you a special attack, used by charging one players attack then shooting the other player so they become the Shubibin. This can be used to devastating effect. The one thing that sets this aside from most other games of this genre is the fact that with there being a map, you can pretty much do the levels in any order you wish, which gives you hundreds of different routes to the last boss.[CR]Doing the levels in a different order will give you different power ups. These include a new suit that halves the damage you take, an instant charge Shubibin and a Silver Shubibin that does more damage than the regular Rainbow Shubibin.[CR]Overall, this is a great little platformer that manages to get everything just right.

Many key elements from Wonderboy are here...your ever decreasing health bar (topped up by fruit), the method to jump higher by holding down the attack button, but there are a few differences. Attacks are made in several ways; first by a simple kick (short range and difficult to judge), second by a powerful bottom burp (but remember to turn around before letting one rip) and if those are too much, just jump on the enemies heads in a Mario style.[CR]Throughout the landscapes are many objects to be kicked, some gain you coins, some fruit, others open up bonus areas (like the Wonderboy-style bonus level in the clouds). Also, kicking a doorway will open it, allowing you to venture inside to either full health and tips from your partner (usually in some crazy disguise) or a fruit machine where you can gamble collected coins to gain goodies. And speaking of your partner, look out for him along the way, often making a nuisance of himself by throwing cans at you or taking a dump behind bushes.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- Continue -[CR]On the Game Over screen, hold I+II and push RUN.[CR]- Level skip - [CR]On Level 1-4 (the upper area) there is a brick platform across a gap.

The original Japanese release is based on an anime license, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru, which follows the adventures of a young boy named Wataru after he is transported to a fantasy world and becomes a hero. The title can either mean Demon (Majin) Hero Wataru or Machine (Mashin) Hero Wataru; a deliberate pun, as both monsters and mechs were featured in the anime.[CR]The game is notorious for its lack of quality, which is only exacerbated by the fact that it was the pack-in game and thus fairly prominent among system owners.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]B.A.D., the Beastly Alien Dudes, have invaded Earth and burrowed into the ground, causing much havoc. Keith is a member of N.I.C.E., Nations of International Citizens for Earth and is tasked with the job of ridding Earth of B.A.D..[CR]The game consists of 7 stages that have an overworld and underworld for the player to traverse. The overworld is where Keith can talk to a few friends like the Prophet who warns of danger ahead, the Wise Wizard who sells bombs and Nurse Nancy who heals Keith's wounds for a price. There are also a few enemies to deal with, like flying pots and spinning cats that fall from the sky. The Weapons Master also lets Keith upgrade his sword, for a price, to use in the underworld level ahead. Upon reaching the end of the overworld, the player can jump on a platform and take a rainbow transport to the underworld.[CR]Upon entering the underworld, Keith is in an armored suit called the Nova Suit. He also receives an upgraded sword and bombs to fight a variety of enemies. The underworld has Keith mostly going from side to side and sometimes vertically to get to the end where the boss awaits. Jumping down a hole leads into the boss's chamber where the boss fight would commence.[CR]Accolades[CR]In issue 66 of Retro Gamer in an article about the history of Hudson, the game was listed as one of their games to miss.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Last Boss[CR]When dropping into the chamber of the last boss, simply position yourself so you fall directly into the small gap between the boss's back and the wall. The boss will stand idle and not move while you kill it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Super Coins[CR]Look out for the Lucky Cats which appear on some stages. If you kill enough of them, a red cat will come. Kill it and it will drop a red coin. This coin is worth a lot more than the regular coins.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1988</year>		<genre>Action, Adventure</genre>		<studio>NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch the blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Failure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends. (In the original coin-op, the game ends when all drops are used.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Continues[CR]Start a game with 9 credits.

While driving through the levels, you aren't getting shot at every 2 seconds, until you fight the bosses anyway. The fact that you can spin off the road, get bumped by other cars, and crash into lamp posts makes you have to pay attention to what you're doing. The bosses are a pain in the butt. You're under constant fire from them and there's no meter that shows their energy. Also, you only have one life for the whole game.

The gameplay is particularly simple - the screen auto scrolls and you have to punch, kick and dodge the various enemies and obstacles that appear in your way.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]The Kung Fu suffers from very shallow gameplay, playing more like a souped-up graphics demo than a full blown game, which it probably was at the time. The clumsy controls don't help either - however, once you get into the feel of it there is some enjoyment to be had. This game is more about showing what the PC Engine could do than anything else and because of its place in the history of the console, it gains a little more interest than it probably deserves.

The dungeons move nicely, not anywhere near as good as in Phantasy Star, but as good as say Order of the Griffon, and after about 20 minutes or so you get an automap feature that helps out a TON. The enemies are all big, and even though they don't animate, there are a ton of different types, some of them are HUGE and take up the whole screen. My main problem with the graphics is that EVERY level of the dungeon looks exactly the same! I'm not asking for new dungeon graphics or anything, but at least change the freakin color of the walls so I know I'm making progress![CR]There isn't a whole lot of character devolopment, unfortunately. You basically level up, and that's about it. You can't equip anything (the game will automatically equip certain items when you find them), you can't cast offensive magic, you can't even name your character. About the only thing you have in your arsenal is a healing spell and a special attack that, if it works, will hit an enemy up to 4 times in one turn (great for bosses, usually takes them out in one turn).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of you wandering through the maze until you meat a mid boss, after which you get a full screen pic of a woman still clothed. Then, if you manage to beat the main boss of that level of the dungeon, you get the same pic only minus the clothes. Be prepared for TONS of random encounters though, you literally get attacked every 2 steps sometimes. The battles go by extremely fast, thankfully, most of the time one hit will kill the enemy once you're at a respectable level. In the later levels you'll be making MUCH use of the save anywhere feature, because some monsters can seriously kill you in one blow. It's frustrating to have to keep saving, loading, saving, loading, but believe me it better than having to backtrack. Once you get your guy leveled up enough most monsters won't be that much of a problem, but it takes alot of time to get to that point.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- No hit mode -[CR]Hold I and turn on the console.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/turbo16/review/R27283.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Games Express</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<videoid>lK6GZDjCSlg</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589015-lady-sword</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/lady-sword/3030-33596/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/5/59247/1667315-ls.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/160705/2256616-ladyswordscreen4.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/160705/2256615-ladyswordscreen3.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/160705/2256614-ladyswordscreen2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/160705/2256613-ladyswordscreen1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/1/8/gfs_81807_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/8/5/gfs_81807_2_1.jpg</snapshot6>	</game>	<game name="Legend of Hero Tonma (USA)">		<description>Legend of Hero Tonma (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FLegend%20of%20Hero%20Tonma%20%28USA%29.zip" size="226145" />		<title_clean>Legend of Hero Tonma</title_clean>		<plot>A little caped hero called Tommy must fight his way to the boss' castle through a cute world to rescue a princess, but stopping him from his rescue mission will be several enemies, which he has to deal with by launching little fireballs at them.

It has a much darker tone than the first game, which is better reflected in the Japanese title (Ankoku Densetsu/ &#26263;&#40658;&#20253;&#35500; = Dark Legend).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Zark assaults his brother. [CR]Many years ago, a mighty hero named Brace defeated the Demon King Drodam, returning light and peace to the world. Rescuing the beautiful Grace from Drodam's clutches, he eventually established a kingdom and Grace bore him two children, Selius and Zark. Selius was first in line, and Zark grew increasingly jealous of his brother; he eventually made a deal with the fallen Drodam and established a cult to gain power. With the death of Brace and Grace, Zark and Selius fight over the throne! All of this culminates as Zark throws his brother Selius from the top of his mighty dark castle.... [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is simple; the player controls Selius' motion with the D-pad, attacks with the "II" button and jumps with the "I" button. Pressing the "run" button while playing the game will also cause Selius to throw a bomb (provided he has any) Picking up additional weapons will power up weapon strength, to a maximum of six levels. The life gauge also maxes out at 10, and Selius can only hold 10 bombs in stock.ItemsA refreshing item. Life Gauge Up: Appearing as a star, this adds one permanent point to the life meter. It will disappear if Selius dies.Life point: Resembling a moon, this refills one depleted point of the life meter.Full life restore: A sun that fully restores all lost life points.1up: An extra life.7up: 7 extra lives. Rare!chain: An iron weight on the end of a chain that resembles a plumb-bob. It is the weakest of the three weapons, but has the most range and fast attack speed.Axe: A powerful weapon, but it has bad range and is too slow to be useful.Sword: The starting weapon, it has good strength and range, and good speed!Bomb: A bomb. Damages or destroys all enemies on screen when thrown![CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1: Selius lands at the base of Zark's dark tower, miraculously still alive. He picks up his sword and proceeds to begin the process of climbing to the top again. En route he is attacked by hordes of violent cultists, bizarrely called "Pumpman". The boss of the stage is a strange demonic entity that likes to suddenly kick Selius. Stage 2: Selius enters a sewer to gain access to the tower. Large numbers of zombies and disgusting giant cockroaches swarm this area. The boss is a strange head-like creature referred to as "Cloud Genesis" in the manual. Stage 3: Selius continues to scale the tower, and continues to be assaulted at every turn by monsters. Strange skeletal beasts are in the walls here, and are eager to burst out and cause harm. The boss is midget with an iron ball called "Iron Punk"; after his death, the ball itself continues the attack! Stage 4: Ever higher our hero climbs. Miniature dragons now stand in his way, and the journey upwards isn't helped by collapsing skull platforms! The boss is a spooky haunted doll. Stage 5: The tower takes a decidedly demonic turn; this part consists of pulsating flesh and the walls and floor are coated with villi. Hordes of zombies abound, and strange new creatures put in a cameo. The boss is a giant worm. Stage 6: Selius is close to the end now! Climbing the exterior of the tower, Selius battles even more hordes of cultists and skeletons, all while avoid being struck by lightning. If only those creepy lightning rods worked better... the boss is a strange golden man who shoots balls from his chest and energy from his navel.Stage 7: What's going on here? Suddenly the area is largely mechanical and populated by robots. Selius' metal weaponry can be a liability here, as the floors, walls, and ceiling all have magnets secreted in them. At the end awaits the self-crowned King Zark, and quite possibly the revived Drodam himself... but another question remains; is Selius any better than Zark?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 continues[CR]At the title screen, enter any of the following codes:</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>4.2</rating>		<videoid>ec4HmMeISBw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5675</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589018-legendary-axe-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/legendary-axe-ii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legendary-axe-ii/3030-6441/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8943</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5675-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5675-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71254-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100051-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100052-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-introduction.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100053-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100054-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-wounded.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100055-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-obtained-a-chain.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100056-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-you-are-the-most.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100057-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-throwing-a-smart.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100058-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-boss.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100059-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-victory.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100060-legendary-axe-ii-turbografx-16-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/3HzoK7X.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Legendary Axe, The (USA)">		<description>Legendary Axe, The (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FLegendary%20Axe%2C%20The%20%28USA%29.zip" size="165953" />		<title_clean>Legendary Axe, The</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Side-scrolling platform brawler known for its high degree of difficulty.

The player can increase the main character's damage for his axe, but swinging too often depletes this power temporarily, so it's better to aim than swing wildly in order to get the most out of each swing.[CR]It was a critical hit, receiving Game of the Year Award from Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment magazine. This caused quite the uproar of readers of all gaming magazines of the day, especially EGM.[CR]It is, fairly surprisingly, still not on the Virtual Console, despite being one of the highest profile releases for the TG-16.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The player is Gogan, who is seeking to save Flare, a childhood friend, from a sacrifice to a local cult. When Gogan learns that Flare has been sent to the sacrifice, the village elders gives him the legendary axe in order to save her and battle the cult that has tormented the village for generations.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1988</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

Does it seem like a game has been rehashed so many times that there can't possibly be any life left in it? Are you sometimes apalled by the lack of innovation coming from game development houses? If you answered yest to any of these questions, you're not alone.[CR]When it comes to beating a dead horse (relax...it's only a figure of speech, animal lovers), Lode Runner has got to be one of those titles that will forever live in infamy. Let's get serious here, this game was released for the Apple II!!! What was Pack-In Video doing re-releasing it for the PC Engine? Did they have some sort of trick up their sleeve that we could not have foreseen? These are the questions that the staff of turbografx.net was asking.[CR]So you've heard many times that a first appearance is a very important thing, right? Often a game is judged very quickly based upon it's graphics. Although I hate to do that, it turned out that my first impression was right about this game. Lode Runner is an old school puzzler, in which you run about a labyrinth and try to pick up piles of gold before some heinous monster grabs you. The graphics in the PC Engine version are decided old school looking. Little effort was put into revamping the appeance from the crusty old IBM PC release. Sure, NEC's powerful console could have handled the load, but don't try to tell that to Pack-In Video. You'll find only the very smallest of sprites here with very little detail. The backgrounds are very plain as well and leave much to be desired.[CR]The sound effects amount to little more than beeps and boops. Even the background music sounds little better than an old midi track. Granted, HuCards have been known for their share of troubles when it comes to sound, but this is ridiculous. The full capabilities of the platform have not nearly been put to the test.[CR]As if these things weren't enough, I feel like the gameplay could have been a little bit tighter. It's your job to dig a hole in the ground for your enemy to fall into. Unfortunately, you have to do this well before your enemy approaches you or you will be facing an untimely demise. Although I'm biased, the lack of a multi-player option is always a no-no in my book as well.[CR]Trying to give a much needed boost in the arm to a sorry attempt at a game, Pack-In Video did include a couple of features to help with the lasting appeal. First, they provided a password system to allow the gamer to continue off at the level they last played. Let's be honest, who would want to suffer through this game more than once? Besides that, they included a feature that I have not seen before on a TurboGrafx title. You can actually edit existing levels and create your own new levels. After giving it a try, I don't personally see a lot of appeal in doing this, but maybe this will be the one feature that will put the game over the top for a purchase in your eyes.[CR]When it comes down to it, Lode Runner is a game that needed to be put to rest long ago. I can't believe that they actually released some even newer iterations for the PlayStation consoles. Granted, I have not tried these versions, but I don't necessarily expect the best. Even if you're really hungry for an extra puzzle game in your collection, you should probably avoid this title, unless you can get it as a part of a bundle with some better games. Why not look for something a little bit more innovative instead? [CR]Translation Descrption: [CR]Well, there wasn't much to do with this, it was all menu work. But it accomplished its goal: it gave Mr. Shadoff some experience with PCE translation and hacking, and it gave some much-needed attention to the need for PCE translations. The game is totally playable, so download the patch already![CR]Reviewer: Fabio[CR]http://www.turbografx.net/softdetail.asp?soft_id=33[CR]http://romhacking.net/trans/673/[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/2002</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Pack-In-Video Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>wghMu9q0xJg</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589020-lode-runner</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/lode-runner-lost-labyrinth</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/lode-runner-lost-labyrinth/3030-40941/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10268</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/26/2399927-loderunner_pce.jpeg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/553165-lode-runner-lost-labyrinth-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/553166-lode-runner-lost-labyrinth-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/553167-lode-runner-lost-labyrinth-turbografx-16-screenshot-editor.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/1/5/gfs_4959_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/8/8/gfs_4959_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/3o4hrVa.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Maerchen Maze (Japan)">		<description>Maerchen Maze (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FMaerchen%20Maze%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="140788" />		<title_clean>Maerchen Maze</title_clean>		<plot>Obviously based on Alice in Wonderland, Maerchen Maze is a cute and colourful platform romp. You adventure through forests, caves, castles and such, defeating the many enemies by letting out a loud scream that shoots across the screen. The scream can be powered up by holding down the button, but leave it too long and you'll get out of breath and stand there panting, defenseless for a few moments.[CR]Aside from your voice, you can also jump on enemies to dispatch them. As you progress through the stages (each with a boss at the end of course) you also gain magic powers in the form of books. By pushing RUN then selecting your power with BUTTON I, you get the chance to do such things as show hidden power-ups and become invincible for a short time.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]Visually and sonically, Alice is nice. Bright backdrops and sprites suit the subject matter and the jolly tunes are quite adequate. However, at first the game seems hard, brutally hard. You only have 3 life points and it's very easy to lose them, and things like the ease at which you can fall off a ladder really begin to shorten your temper. After a little practice, things do improve. Learning to use your magic frequently is a good tip and makes life a bit easier.[CR]Also, once you realise that it is often better to avoid rather than engage, you will last a lot longer. However, the learning curve is still a little too steep and will most likely put people off. Even once you have gotten used to how the game plays, you will still find yourself thrown into frustration far too often, and when a continue puts you back at the start of the level you're more likely to turn the game off than persevere, especially if you're at a particularly nasty boss. It's a shame as it could have been a great little game. If you enjoy challenging platformers then by all means try it, but I will be leaving this one on the shelf.

Quest, for those of you who live in a video game devoid hole, was the company responsible for creating the critically acclaimed Ogre Battle series. Magical Chase is a side-scrolling shooter in which you play a witch on a broomstick. (This concept may sound familiar to Cotton fans)[CR]The soundtrack is pretty good, but what's most impressive are the graphics. Colorful and fast moving, the sprites and animations are great, not to mention lots of other special graphical effects. Even more impressive is the multi-plane scrolling. The TG-16 hardware only supports a single background layer. Many games create parallax scrolling in the background by using layers of sprites or modifying the horizontal sync rate of different portions of the background (the latter technique was used extensively on NES to perform "fake" parallax). Magical Chase is commonly accused of doing the impossible (on the TG-16, anyway), so seamless and perfect is the multi-plane scrolling it exhibits.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- Bonuses -[CR]Enter these codes on the difficulty select screen[CR]Press Left, Down, RIght, Up, Select three times, Left, Right, I - Get 60,000 gems[CR]Left, down, right, up, SELECT, SELECT, SELECT, left, right, II - Music test[CR]http://www.racketboy.com/retro/turbografx-16/2007/07/tg16-pc-engine-games-that-pushed-the-limits-best-graphics-sound.html[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Magical_Chase.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonuses[CR]Enter these codes on the difficulty select screen</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>OHyvX5dzwEI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>4108</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589022-magical-chase</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/magical-chase</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8881</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://i.imgur.com/Teucusk.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/4108-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633893-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633894-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-1st-seal.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633895-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-chicken-head-with-leg.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633896-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-sweet-enemies.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633897-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-lions-on-silver-surfer.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633898-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-blobs.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633899-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-cubical-view-d.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633900-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-shop.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633901-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-balloon-enemies.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/633902-magical-chase-turbografx-16-screenshot-flying-skulls.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/co8WAaO.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Mahjong Gakuen - Touma Soushirou Toujou (Japan)">		<description>Mahjong Gakuen - Touma Soushirou Toujou (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FMahjong%20Gakuen%20-%20Touma%20Soushirou%20Toujou%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="282764" />		<title_clean>Mahjong Gakuen - Touma Soushirou Toujou</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mahjong Gakuen Touma Soushirou Toujou is a mahjong game for the PC Engine that features pixellated nudity.

The protagonist Yusaku Godai is a struggling student staying at the titular boarding house. When the young widow Kyoko Otonashi arrives as Maison Ikkoku's new manager, Godai is instantly smitten and seeks a way to win her heart. Much of the game's storyline concerns the burgeoning relationship between Godai and Kyoko, and the antics of Maison Ikkoku's other tenants who tend to take advantage of Godai's doormat nature.[CR]The game adaptation was originally released for the PC98-01 and MSX in 1986 before being ported to various other Japanese home computers, including also the Nintendo Famicom in 1988 and the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. It plays similarly to other Japanese adventure games of the era: the player is given a selection of commands that often changes depending on the player's location, and must determine the correct series of commands necessary to continue the story.[CR]No version of the game was ever officially localized into English, though the PC Engine version received a fan translation in 2008.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<genre>Adventure</genre>		<studio>Micro Cabin</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>33507</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589029-maison-ikkoku</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/maison-ikkoku/3030-33733/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/33507-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/33507-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797197-maisonikkoku001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797196-maison_ikkoku_%28j%29-004.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797195-maison_ikkoku_%28j%29-003.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797194-maison_ikkoku_%28j%29-002.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797193-maison_ikkoku_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/6/f/gfs_4448_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/f/2/gfs_4448_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Makai Hakkenden Shada (Japan)">		<description>Makai Hakkenden Shada (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FMakai%20Hakkenden%20Shada%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="130128" />		<title_clean>Makai Hakkenden Shada</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Makai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.[CR]Makai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or "Eight Dog Chronicles", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for "dog" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels.[CR]Unlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character. Instead, other characters from the novels occasionally appear to help the player.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>1/4/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action, RPG</genre>		<studio>Data East Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589099-makai-hakkenden-shada</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/makai-hakkenden-shada</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/makai-hakkenden-shada/3030-42796/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2490775-makai_hakkenden_shada_pce.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482516-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-this-very-short.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482517-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482518-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-starting-in.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482519-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-equipment-screen.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482520-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-buying-stuff.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482521-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-chatting-with.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482522-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-what-s-the.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482523-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-these-baboons.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482524-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-hmm-how-to.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482525-makai-hakkenden-shada-turbografx-16-screenshot-meeting-in.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Makai Prince Dorabocchan (Japan)">		<description>Makai Prince Dorabocchan (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FMakai%20Prince%20Dorabocchan%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="174230" />		<title_clean>Makai Prince Dorabocchan</title_clean>		<plot>Makai Prince Dorabocchan is an Action game, published by Naxat Soft,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>21/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action, Platform, 2D</genre>		<studio>Naxat Soft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>foI67VbEAdg</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>30102</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/579915-makai-prince-dorabocchan</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/makai-prince-dorabocchan</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/30102-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/574658-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/574659-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-let-s-go.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/574660-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-baddies.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/574661-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-change-of.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/801627-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-moving-in.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/801628-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-big-and.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/801629-makai-prince-dorabocchan-turbografx-16-screenshot-witches.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/1/6/gfs_20390_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/8/b/gfs_20390_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/5/b/gfs_20390_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Makyou Densetsu (Japan)">		<description>Makyou Densetsu (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FMakyou%20Densetsu%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="166167" />		<title_clean>Makyou Densetsu</title_clean>		<plot>Legendary Axe is a fantastic side-scrolling adventure game which was released for the Turbo Grafx 16 in America in the year 1989. In this game you control the hero, Gogan, armed with a magical axe called "Sting". The setting is one of a prehistoric world full of cannibals, lizard people, goblins, and an assortment of unfriendly creatures. The objective of the game is to run the gauntlet of levels and face off against a gigantic boss to rescue your girlfriend.[CR]When it was released it was probably the greatest game of this genre. It won the "Game of the Year" for 'GamePro' magazine, and received high critical acclaim from the editors of 'Electronic Gaming Monthly'. I'm not sure if those magazines even exist anymore. However, 20 years later most people do not remember this game. Legendary Axe is loosely based on the arcade game known as Astyanax (possibly without the original developer's consent). There are apparently a quagmire of licensing issues preventing this game from being released, legally, on newer consoles.[CR]GAMEPLAY:[CR]The game is a standard side-scrolling platform. The control is precise, but does require some skill in order to master the different types of jumps and charged attacks using the power meter. The game is very difficult and when you die, you are sent back to the beginning of the level, which can be a little frustrating. The levels are very intricate and detailed, especially considering the primitive technology used to animate them.[CR]STORY:[CR]The story is kind of irrelevant for this sort of game, but there is enough to it to make defeating the boss at the end of the game rewarding. Basically, you are caveman and the bad guy kidnapped your girlfriend in order to sacrifice her to his moon Gods (or something). Some of the enemy characters do not make a lot of sense. For instance, in one level you face off against a very detailed giant rock that is alive and trying to run you over. In another level you are attacked by bipedal bears. But its different, and that is always a bonus.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/turbo16/review/R133750.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Victor Interactive Software</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>9.3</rating>		<videoid>h456P9RyTA8</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5674</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589017-the-legendary-axe</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legendary-axe/3030-1906/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5674-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5674-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712440-legendaryaxe001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712439-makyo_densetsu_%28legendary_axe%29_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097089-tlaxe_018.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097088-tlaxe_017.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097087-tlaxe_016.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097086-tlaxe_015.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097085-tlaxe_014.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097084-tlaxe_013.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097083-tlaxe_012.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1097082-tlaxe_011.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Maniac Puroresu - Asu e no Tatakai (Japan)">		<description>Maniac Puroresu - Asu e no Tatakai (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FManiac%20Puroresu%20-%20Asu%20e%20no%20Tatakai%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="276432" />		<title_clean>Maniac Puroresu - Asu e no Tatakai</title_clean>	</game>	<game name="Mashin Eiyuu Den Wataru (Japan)">		<description>Mashin Eiyuu Den Wataru (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FMashin%20Eiyuu%20Den%20Wataru%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="124252" />		<title_clean>Mashin Eiyuu Den Wataru</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Keith Courage in Alpha Zones is a side-scrolling action adventure game that served as the pack-in game for the TurboGrafx-16. The original Japanese release is based on an anime license, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru, which follows the adventures of a young boy named Wataru after he is transported to a fantasy world and becomes a hero. The title can either mean Demon (Majin) Hero Wataru or Machine (Mashin) Hero Wataru; a deliberate pun, as both monsters and mechs were featured in the anime.[CR]The game is notorious for its lack of quality, which is only exacerbated by the fact that it was the pack-in game and thus fairly prominent among system owners.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]B.A.D., the Beastly Alien Dudes, have invaded Earth and burrowed into the ground, causing much havoc. Keith is a member of N.I.C.E., Nations of International Citizens for Earth and is tasked with the job of ridding Earth of B.A.D..[CR]The game consists of 7 stages that have an overworld and underworld for the player to traverse. The overworld is where Keith can talk to a few friends like the Prophet who warns of danger ahead, the Wise Wizard who sells bombs and Nurse Nancy who heals Keith's wounds for a price. There are also a few enemies to deal with, like flying pots and spinning cats that fall from the sky. The Weapons Master also lets Keith upgrade his sword, for a price, to use in the underworld level ahead. Upon reaching the end of the overworld, the player can jump on a platform and take a rainbow transport to the underworld.[CR]Upon entering the underworld, Keith is in an armored suit called the Nova Suit. He also receives an upgraded sword and bombs to fight a variety of enemies. The underworld has Keith mostly going from side to side and sometimes vertically to get to the end where the boss awaits. Jumping down a hole leads into the boss's chamber where the boss fight would commence.[CR]Accolades[CR]In issue 66 of Retro Gamer in an article about the history of Hudson, the game was listed as one of their games to miss.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Last Boss[CR]When dropping into the chamber of the last boss, simply position yourself so you fall directly into the small gap between the boss's back and the wall.

You are a combat-equipped slinky which can walk (slink) on walls. You navigate various levels to defeat zodiac-inspired bosses.[CR]Mesopotamia is an original and cute platform game by Atlus. Player controls a weird looking creature that moves by sticking one of its end to walls, in a way similar to a caterpillar or more precicely like those metallic string toys that can go down the stairs. The game is based on Zodiacal elements and counts twelve big stages with a nasty boss at the end of each of them. Many other weird creatures are also spreaded around each maze and are there to stop you. Your creature has an extra ring in its middle which can fire back at those ennoying things. To increase the challenge a little, the player mush reach the exit of each time within a time limit. When destroyed, some enemies drop special power-ups, like extra life, shields or the priceless super-speed or bouncing-shots options...[CR]Mesopotamia is an interesting and somehow entertaining platform game. The string like creature is very well designed and the fact you can also stick to the inside of the maze adds an amazing depth to the game. However, some stages are very large and it is very easy to get lost and I personnaly hate the fact that the boss fight is included in the time limit. That's much too hard... however I love the super-speed option allowing you to more the tinny pink slug at super-fast speed through the mazes. All in all, you will probably have fun playing Mesopotamia, the game is far to be a milestone in Video game history, but it hides some nice surprises and unusual elements and it is one of a kind.[CR]http://www.racketboy.com/retro/turbografx-16/2008/01/the-best-undiscovered-turbografx-16-games.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Black and White mode[CR]At the Sound Screen , Press SELECT, UP,Up,DOWN,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,LEFT,RIGHT,II,I.

It is the first in Hudson's long-running Nectaris series, which was still seeing new entries when Hudson finally folded in 2012, after which the rights got passed to Konami.[CR]The game was originally released on the TurboGrafx-16, where it saw a US and Japan release. The game was later added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006, where it saw its European debut.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]From the opening of the game:[CR]&#8230; The 21st Century &#8230;[CR]The Earth has become all too small for man's insatiable needs. However, the moon has offered vast resources for Earth's greatest countries.[CR]The most powerful nations staked their claims for the moon's riches and much fighting has occurred. The evil Axis Empire has been behind much of this terror.[CR]Finally, on april 6, 2089, the Axis Empire's army launches an all out attack and captures most of the moon. All innocent people must now fight or perish.[CR]The Axis army now occupies most of the moon's factories where they are continually producing new weapons for their secret assault on the planet Earth.[CR]The Axis secret police have rounded up many members of the Allied Powers and put them in prisons. Without their key people, the Allied Powers stands little chance.[CR]Meanwhile, the Axis Empire draws closer to launching their "S.A.M." or Supreme Atomic Missile&#8230;the weapon they will use to destroy the Earth.[CR]The Allied Powers know they must free their prisoners if they stand a chance to stop the S.A.M. before launch time.[CR]You must free the prisoners and stop this military madness before the Axis Empire and their secret weapon S.A.M. destroy the Earth and all its people!!![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Military Madness is to destroy all enemy units or capture the enemy base in each of the game's 16 levels. The player starts the first level with basic units. As they progress through the levels more units become available. A turn consists of moving and/or attacking with each unit one by one. Units can be restored in factories. Only infantry units can take over factories and the enemy base. Attackers and defenders get bonuses for certain formations with nearby units (or the "Zone of Control"), such as the surround effect. The type of terrain a unit is on affects the possible distance it can travel as well as its defensive ability. Units become more powerful by gaining experience for each battle they survive.Units[CR]A variety of units allow for many strategic possibilities. They are divided up as follows:[CR]Foot Soldiers- Weak units that can capture bases and factories.Charlie GX-77Kilroy GX-87Panther CBX-1[CR]Tanks- The most common ground unit, with varied power and range.Bison S-61Lenet TT-1Polar PT-6Grizzly T-79Slagger GS-81Titan GT-86Giant HMB-2[CR]Lightweight Armored Vehicles- Weaker units that can move, attack, and move again in one turn.Rabbit MB-5Lynx MB-4[CR]Combat Aircraft- Very long ranged. They are not affected by terrain. Only specific units can attack aircraft.Falcon FX-1Eagle AX-87Hunter EF-88[CR]Artillery- Guns that can attack long distance.Hadrian SG-4Octopus MR-22Seeker AAG-4Hawkeye MM-107Atlas SS-80[CR]Land Mine- Can't move or attack. Used as support for other units or as a roadblock.Trigger M-77[CR]Transport- Weak, long-ranging units that can carry slower units.Mule MC-1Pelican C-41[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords (JP version)[CR]Note: unlisted levels have the same password as the US version[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate colors[CR]Power on the system, and hold Select to reset.

There are 6 racetracks featured including real-world ones such as Laguna Seca. Before each race you can buy a full compliment of upgrades and weapons, with each area (engine, handling, turbo and so on) having several variably-priced options). The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader. If you slip too far behind, your car is blown up and placed back onto the track further on in order to keep up (similarly to Micro Machines).

A three-press control system is used for playing shots, switching to a two-click once you reach the green (as draw and fade become irrelevant).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Girl Play[CR]When starting a new game, instead of picking a predetermined player, choose to enter your own name.

Nectaris, however, gave war games an interesting twist. Nectaris takes place in the future, with Allied forces battling Axis forces (interesting WWII reference) for the moon and its resources. Your forces, the Allies, and the enemy Axis forces maneuver on a new hex map each level, but the game switches to a side view when your forces engage in battle, letting you admire your success or lament your failure.[CR]Graphically the game is fairly straightforward, and the few music tracks are nothing particularly impressive. Don't let that fool you, however, as you will become addicted. I won't go into too much detail because describing tactical war games can sometimes get messy, but Military Madness really isn't difficult to learn to play and yet it retains a modicum of complexity.[CR]It's also ass hard and will kick you around quite a bit once you make it past the first few levels. But boy is it nice when you get your HMB-2 Giant unit up to max experience and it becomes nearly indestructible. Mind you, I said NEARLY indestructible.

It was published by Nintendo and developed by    Technos Japan Corporation.  The soccer (football) in the game is six on six between many different countries including East Germany and West Germany.  You can play soccer on grass, sand, ice and dirt.  The game was designed by the same developers of   River City Ransom and such, the players have large heads and short legs.  In fact, many of the same sprites used in River City Ransom are used in World Cup.  The game also features some of the most addicting music ever on the NES. When it comes to slide tackles, there are no fouls.  It is encouraged to take out players via slide tackle to take the ball from them.  Also, if you tackle a player enough times, the player will get injured and will no longer be able to play.  Instead, the player would remain unconscious on the field until a goal was scored.  The tackle animations are quite pleasing.   Players are given five super shots per half and can be used by performing a header or a bicycle kick.  Each country had its own unique supershot.  What is unique about these shots is how crazy they were.  Some would look like they are going one direction then go another and some would go so fast you could barely see them.Also, every first game is against Cameroon for some reason.Nintendo World Cup's Multiplayer mode allows players to choose the type of field they would play on.  Available choices include sand, grass, dirt, and ice.  These alternative surfaces have a big effect on gameplay.  The dirt field has big rocks that could trip players, even so far as to injure them enough so the player would lie unconscious on the field.  The ice field makes players slide around, while the sand field slows the ball's movement considerably.

During CES 2011 it was announced that the title would have a release on the PlayStation Network in February 2011.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The evil king demon Dirth shoots down from the sky, and kidnaps Princess Aurora. A young boy is then called upon by an old lady who goes by 'Mother', and tells the young boy named Jazeta all of what has happened. The Mother then tells Jazeta that the evil wizard Dirth was once sealed by the eight Medallions once collected together, and if Jazeta was to find the eight medallions, Jazeta could then seal Dirth and save Aurora. Jazeta accepts, then starts out on a huge adventure, where he must explore the entire world, travel through diverse lands and battle through tough and treacherous labyrinths full of evil creatures. Jazeta acquires many skills, as well as items throughout this vast land, and see the world in front of his own eyes, and face all fears to become a true man and a true hero. And once he has saved the princess, peace will then be restored to Earth using the power of the eight Medallions.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Neutopia is played from a flip-screen overhead view (similar to The Legend of Zelda), and is an action-adventure based game. Jazeta wanders around an overworld, exploring caves to find NPCs, shops or different areas of the map. He starts the game with a sword, and can find and use additional items throughout the game, and as well, acquire keys items that will help him advance in his journey. During the game, as Jazeta moves through different areas, and battle enemies in each area, and collect health or magic when killed.[CR]Throughout the game there will be labyrinths that Jazeta has to go through to progress further into the game, while entrances to labyrinths are visible, they later become hidden. Each labyrinth has obstacles that can be overcome with key items, which often need to be found on the overworld first or somewhere else in the dungeon, and each item does something different and unique, such as the bow, bombs, and a boomerang to hit or kill certain enemies and objects throughout the game. Jazeta's health is represented in a bar, similar to The Legend of Zelda's hearts. Enemies in each area or dungeon are different and unique, requiring Jazeta to sometimes use one of his other items to defeat enemies instead of his sword. Bosses are very similar to the Zelda series bosses, requiring puzzle techniques to beat, usually involving the item found in that boss's dungeon.[CR]Jazeta will collect items through treasure chests, and it usually involves some sort of puzzle to get to them. He can also go to shops and purchase either, weapons, shield, and even some type of magic, like health potions. Items can be bought by using coins found by destroying objects, rocks, and enemies.[CR]In Neutopia, there is a total of five overworld areas and twelve Labyrinths. Jazeta talks to townspeople throughout his adventure to collect information and clues on where he will have to go next. After every couple medallions, he will then unlock hidden stairs to the next overworld in the main hub, where he will be revisiting a lot to continue in his quest.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Labyrinth Passwords[CR]At the Start Screen, select continue and choose recover game with a PASSWORD and enter the following (All Passwords are case-sensitive and there are only the letter O's, there are no zeros in the password screen)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Labyrinth Passwords[CR]At the Start Screen, select continue and choose recover game with a PASSWORD and enter the following (All Passwords are case-sensitive and there are only the letter O's, there are no zeros in the password screen)</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<videoid>8YG2P4JevME</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5677</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589047-neutopia</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/neutopia</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/neutopia/3030-2936/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8883</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5677-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5677-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/XOJJurS.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45927-neutopia-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/102503-neutopia-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94346-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94331-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94332-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-hero-receives-his-mission.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94333-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-inventory-and-equipment.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94334-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-starting-location.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94335-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-a-lonely-slime-looks-at-you.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94336-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-nice-rugs.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94337-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-princess-is-that-you.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94338-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-trying-to-kill-an-innocent.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94339-neutopia-turbografx-16-screenshot-attacks-from-all-the-sides.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/ehcBZHk.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Neutopia II (USA)">		<description>Neutopia II (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FNeutopia%20II%20%28USA%29.zip" size="440627" />		<title_clean>Neutopia II</title_clean>		<plot>Some years have passed since the brave hero Jazeta destroyed Dirth, the Emperor of Darkness. Peace has returned to the land of Neutopia. But there are still monsters roaming the countryside, and some of them were spotted near Yurius Shrine. Jazeta went there to find out what exactly had happened. But he didn't return... You are Jazeta's son, and you must first of all find your missing father! Can it be that the shadow of Emperor of Darkness threatens the peaceful land again?..[CR]The sequel to "Neutopia" is similar to the predecessor in every way. Navigating your hero from a top-down view, you explore the vast countryside, fighting monsters in real time combat. The game is not a true RPG, but an action adventure: you don't gain any experience points from combat, only collect money to buy supplies. In dungeons, you must use bombs on walls to reveal secret passages, push stones, and fight many regular enemies and bosses.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Main Character Sprite[CR]At the name entry screen, type KOALA as your name and the main character will have a radically different look.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Main Character Sprite[CR]At the name entry screen, enter the following Japanese characters as your name (format is Row #, Column #): - 2,5 - 1,1 - 4,6 -.

To reach his castle and rescue Tina, Master Higgins must first rescue the six children, each of whom is hidden on a separate island.[CR]New Adventure Island is a one-player action game that consists of seven areas, with four rounds each. In order to get through the areas, you must use your hatchet to destroy wildlife such as frogs, spiders, birds, snails, insects, and other pests, and watch out for hazards such as rocks, fire, water, and pits. [CR]As you progress further, your vitality will get low, so fruit must be collected in order to restore it. Along the way, you can smash open eggs that will award you with better weapons that include boomerangs, arrows, and magical fire. Some of the eggs will also reveal a fairy, which will protect you from getting hit. If you are unlucky enough to find an eggplant hidden in one of these eggs, your vitality will drain away very fast, and you need to get fruit every five seconds in order to survive.[CR]When you get to the end of an area, you will have to defeat one of the henchmen and rescue a child from one of the four castles.[CR]An update of the original NES game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Levels[CR]Enter the cheat on the title.

The player controls the kiwi bird Tiki and must rescue his fellow kiwis, including his girlfriend Phee-Phee, from the villainous Willy Walrus. Kiwis can be found at the end of each stage, which the player must progress through with a mix of platforming, vehicle sequences and shooting enemies with bolts to remove them.[CR]The computer ports were published by UK company Ocean Software, which also published the NES game in Europe. The North American NES release was named Kiwi Kraze instead. It also saw a Japan-exclusive PC Engine port that would later be added to the Wii's Virtual Console (also Japan only). The Arcade version of The New Zealand Story was also added to the 2005 Taito Legends compilation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of The New Zealand Story takes place in the Zoological Garden of New Zealand's North Island. The two kiwis Tiki and his girlfriend Phee-Phee live happily together with the rest of the colony, until one day Wally Walrus comes to town. Wally captures the defenseless kiwis and carries them off to cages hidden in zoos and parks all over New Zealand. Trapped, they can only await their fate of being eaten by the Walrus![CR]Luckily, while Wally is busy thinking about kiwi meals, Tiki manages to escape from his cage and plans to save his girlfriend Phee-Phee and the rest of the colony. A race against time begins as Tiki battles with Wally's friends in the maze-like worlds of New Zealand's zoos, so that he can finally reach the evil Walrus and save his friends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lives, Continues and Scoring[CR]Tiki starts the game with three lives. He can get a bonus life at 50,000 points and every additional 20,000 points after that. Tiki loses a life when he is hit or when he runs out of oxygen. The player does not have to start the level from the beginning, though. They can resume the game directly where Tiki died. At the beginning of the game the player does not have any continues, but after completing stage 2-4 and 4-5 they are awarded a continue.[CR]Each time Tiki destroys an enemy the player gains 150 points. Additionally, enemies drop bonuses after being defeated. The bonus items are worth 100 extra points and in some cases Tiki also gets a special power from them.[CR]Bonus items include:Fruit: These only give 100 extra pointsWeapons: Bow and Arrow, Bomb, Laser Gun, Plasma Ball.Joystick: This one is only useful for riding balloons. It allows the player to control the balloon in a more sophisticated way than they normally can. It allows Tiki to stay in mid-air (normally the only options are to go either up or down) and change the direction left, right, up and down.Book: The book immediately destroys all enemies on-screen.Potion: The potion grants Tiki temporal invincibility.Stopwatch: All enemies are immobilized for a limited amount of time.Movement[CR]Tiki has four basic abilities: he can shoot his bow, walk, jump and swim.[CR]Jumping can be alternated in height by holding down the button longer or shorter.[CR]When swimming, Tiki only has a limited supply of oxygen. He can attack enemies from the water when coming up for air by squirting water at them.[CR]Tiki is furthermore able to fly with the help of balloons. Balloons can be found scattered around the levels or he can steal them from enemies. There are six different kinds of balloons in total. Each of them has different characteristics.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 21 levels in total. All the levels are set in real life locations in New Zealand.[CR]The game begins in Auckland, then passes through Rotorua, The Waitomo Caves, Wellington Strait, Cook Strait and Hammer Springs to the final confrontation with Wally at Mount Cook. In every level Tiki has to save one of his kiwi friends, until he finally reaches his girlfriend Phee-Phee. The enemies, however, are not the only problem: There is a time limit for every level. If the player is too slow the Time Dragon will descend.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>23/2/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>_nZqQEvYBFs</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21546</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589050-the-new-zealand-story</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/new-zealand-story</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-new-zealand-story/3030-20020/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10270</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21546-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7930/652591-the_new_zealand_story_uk_box_art__back_.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202367-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95717-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95718-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-round-1-1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95719-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-killed-by-an.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95720-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-a-kiwi-in-distress.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95721-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-rescued-a-kiwi.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95722-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-riding-a-balloon.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95723-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-waste-too-much.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95724-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-who-lives-in.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95725-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-swimming-in.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/95726-the-new-zealand-story-turbografx-16-screenshot-squirting-water.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/PVbsBPp.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="NHK Taiga Drama - Taiheiki (Japan)">		<description>NHK Taiga Drama - Taiheiki (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FNHK%20Taiga%20Drama%20-%20Taiheiki%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="205833" />		<title_clean>NHK Taiga Drama - Taiheiki</title_clean>		<plot>NHK Taiga Drama: Taiheiki is a Strategy game, published by NHK,which was released in Japan in 1992.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Title Screen Codes[CR]At the title screen, highlight "New" (top option) and press:</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>NHK</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589051-nhk-taiga-drama-taiheiki</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/4/2/51842_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/4/2/51842_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/8/gfs_5341_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/4/5/gfs_5341_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/9/5/gfs_5341_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>	</game>	<game name="Night Creatures (USA)">		<description>Night Creatures (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FNight%20Creatures%20%28USA%29.zip" size="237685" />		<title_clean>Night Creatures</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Night Creatures is an action brawler game developed by Manley &amp; Associates and published by NEC Home Electronics exclusively for the TurboGrafx-16 platform.[CR]The player controls an innocent bystander that is suddenly bitten by an enormous bat one night while out on a fog walk.

It was released in the Arcades and was ported to various European home computers (which were published by Activision), the Game Boy and the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. The TG16 version was eventually ported to the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR]The player takes on the role of Tsukikage (Moon Shadow), the canine companion of a slain ninja. The dog takes on his master's form to avenge him by taking on an army of demonic ninja.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can press the select button at any time to switch between one of four weapons (the Righteous Cloud [katana], Swirling Leaf [shuriken], Bamboo Thunder [explosives], and Kusarigama [chain-scythe]). Each weapon can be aimed using the direction pad to attack forward, up, diagonally, and downward, and they can be powered up by collecting red orbs dropped by bright red ninja.[CR]In addition, the hero can multiply by collecting blue orbs dropped by the bright red ninja enemies. Up to two shadow ninja can appear at once, which copy the protagonist's every movement and attack, tripling his attack power. A pinkish orb kills all enemies on screen for a couple of seconds.[CR]The PC-Engine version port is the closest to its arcade counterpart and allows infinite continues as well as two difficulty settings: one where the player has 5 hit points, and another more difficult mode taken directly from the Arcade version where the protagonist is killed in one hit. Certain enemies still kill the hero in one hit regardless of which mode is played.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen, press the code below.

The protagonist, one of two robotic ninja, is fairly durable but not invincible: as they take damage their synthetic flesh falls away to reveal the robot underneath. The goal of the game is to track down the corrupt American President Banglar and assassinate him, thus lifting the oppressive martial law he has declared to keep the population in check.[CR]The Ninja Warriors was originally an Arcade game. It was later ported to many home computers in the West and on the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-16 in Japan only. A heavily revised version developed by Natsume and named simply Ninja Warriors ("The Ninja Warriors Again" in Japan and "Ninja Warriors: The New Generation" in Europe) would later be released for the SNES in 1994.[CR]Development[CR]The arcade version of The Ninja Warriors was developed and published by Taito Corporation in 1987. For the 1986 game, Darius, Taito Corporation had developed a method of creating the effect of a "triple-wide" screen by placing two other screens inside the cabinet and using mirrors create the illusion of three contiguous screens. The Ninja Warriors used the same method to create a large, widescreen display.[CR]The music for the game was produced by Taito's in-house band, Zuntata, and written by Hisayoshi Ogura. Pony Canyon and Scitron released the two soundtracks for the game in 1988 and 1991, while further arrangements were released in 1993 and by Zuntata Records and Taito in 1988 and 2009. The track from the first level, Daddy Mulk, would receive limited acclaim, and was sampled by Australian rock band Lucius Hunt in the track "This Haunting (2006)". An option available in some console versions of the game allowed players to watch a "Prologue" to the game, which featured Zuntata including themselves into plot. The poorly translated English narration claims that the terrorist hero finds his dead friend at the bar with the initials ZTT on his back. The hero finds a nightclub with a neon sign that reads ZTT and watches Zuntata perform. After hearing Zuntata, the terrorist is inspired to create the two ninja robots that kill the President, thus beginning the game.[CR]The Ninja Warriors uses a 8-way Joystick and two buttons which correspond to dagger and ninja star. The game allowed for two player simultaneous play, with the players controlling either a blue male ninja or red female ninja.[CR]Despite the title screen of The Ninja Warriors saying 1987, the arcade cabinet was released in February, 1988. Distribution of the game in the United States was licensed to Romstar.[CR]Taito would supervise ports of the game to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16), Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64, relatively quickly after the release of the arcade version. Because none of the console versions could support the "triple-wide" screen from the arcade game, many of the visuals majorly decreased in quality. Aisystem Tokyo would develop the Mega CD version of the game, which would be released in 1993. Both the PC Engine and Mega CD version would feature plot text over the introduction. The Mega CD version was described by Mega as "very poor by any standards." However, the Mega CD version featured the best graphics, allowed the player to continue where they left off when they died, and additional difficulty settings, all of which is absent from other ports. All of the console versions would be published solely in Japan.[CR]Taito Ninja Warriors Arcade System[CR]Arcade system board: Taito Ninja Warriors (ref)CPU (ref) Main CPU: 2&#215; Motorola 68000 @ 8 MHzSound CPU: ZilogZ80 @ 4 MHzSound chips (ref) Yamaha YM2610 @ 8 MHz Channels: 4 FM channels, 3 SSG channels, 7 ADPCM channelsADPCM: 6 channels @ 18.5 kHz (12-bit), 1 channel @ 1.85&#8211;55.5 kHz (16-bit)Yamaha YM3016F: Stereo audio DACTaito TC006DCA: Custom ceramic DAC/filter moduleTaito TC0140SYT: Custom sound control ICGPU chipset (ref) 3&#215; Taito TC0070RGB RGB/Video Mixer (1 per screen)3&#215; Taito TC0110PCR Palette Generator (1 per screen)3&#215; Taito TC0100SCN Tilemap Generator (1 per screen)Display (ref) (ref) Monitors: 3-monitor setupResolution: 864&#215;224 pixels (288&#215;224 per screen)Scanlines: 256Refresh rate: 60 Hz (60 frames per second)Colors displayed: 12,288 overall, 4096 (12-bit) per screenColor palette: 98,304 overall, 32,768 (15-bit) per screenSprite planeSprite size: 16&#215;16 pixelsColors per sprite: 16 colors (4-bit)Sprites on screen: 128 sprites on screen, 16 KB (16,384 Bytes) sprite RAM, 128 Bytes per spriteSprite texels: 26.686 MHz, 26.686 million texels per second (60 frames per second), 444,766 texels per frame (256 scanlines), 1737 texels per scanlineSprites per scanline: 108Tilemap planes per screen: 3 (9 total) Scrolling background layer: 128&#215;64 (8192) tiles, 8&#215;8 pixels per tileScrolling foreground layer: 128&#215;64 (8192) tiles, 8&#215;8 pixels per tileText layer: 128&#215;32 (4096) charactersHardware capabilities: 2D, scrolling, parallax scrolling, line scrolling[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]In the March 1988 issue of British magazine Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley gave the original arcade version a positive review.

Can you carry the day?[CR]Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. [CR]You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial.

It uses gameplay conventions that are somewhat similar to those from Strategic Simulations, Inc's Gold Box titles: When the party is in towns and dungeons, a first-person view is used, while overland travel happens on a large map of the area.

The game was eventually converted to the PC Engine in 1989 and released in the United States on the TurboGrafx-16 equivalent the following year. The game would later be released for the original PlayStation on Namco Museum Vol. 4 and even later on the TurboGrafx-16 version was rereleased on the North American Wii Virtual Console in 2007.[CR]Ordyne was originally developed for Japanese Arcades on the Namco System 2 hardware. It was released as both an upright Arcade machine and also as a machine in a cocktail configuration.[CR]The game allows two players to play the game simultaneously as the game's two different characters; Yuichiro Tomari and Sunday Chin. Yuichiro pilots the red ship in the game and Sunday pilots a green ship.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ordyne is a classic "shmup", or shoot 'em up game. It is also considered to be one of the original games in the cute 'em up subgenre along with the Konami's Parodius or TwinBee and Sega's Fantasy Zone. Both games are characterized by standard shoot 'em up gameplay but use cute, sometimes anime style cartoon characters in place of the typical starships, airplanes or tanks found in shoot 'em ups. [CR]Ordyne specficially is a horizontal side-scrolling shoot 'em up, like Parodius. The two player's characters must fly their ships and blast enemies while trying to save scientist Tomari's girlfriend and fiancee Kana.[CR]Players die after getting hit with a single shot but can continue the game with lives earned and purchased through the course of the game. Picking up crystals during the game earns more lives for players. Crystals can also be earned by shooting at the rotating target of Dream Co. Ltd., a robot who arrives occasionally at times in the game. Special weapons can also be earned by shooting Dream Co. Ltd.. Crystals can be spent at stores as well, which frequently appear as airships with a giant funnel to fly down.[CR]Each level of the game is accompanied with its own music and ends with a more difficult boss fight.[CR]Original Box Description[CR]The evil Kubota has kidnapped Dr. Tomari's fiancee, Kana, and taken the colossal nuclear reactor Ordyne. In order to reclaim them, Dr. Tomari and his assistant Felix take to their battleships and head off in pursuit. Avoid enemies and advance through seven different levels that take place on land, sea, and air. Collect crystals from defeated enemies and use them to buy items or upgrades for your ship at the Space Inn. Do you have what it takes to defeat the boss at the end of each level and ultimately reach Kubota in the final stage, Kubota World?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Test Mode[CR]At the title screen, hold Run while pressing Select six times, then release. Hold I + II + Up + Left, then press Run to enter the Secret Test Mode. Hold Select and and press Run to reach each part of the Secret Test Mode. You can access a Sound Test, select your starting stage and your starting number of ships, among other things.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1-2</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>2.8</rating>		<videoid>ryKJwuDoBgY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>4109</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589059-ordyne</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/ordyne</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ordyne/3030-5879/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10271</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4109-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/4109-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/181864-ordyne-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202371-ordyne-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323903-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323906-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323905-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-this-is-a-shop.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323907-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-in-which-you-can-buy-various.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323908-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323909-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323910-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-a-bonus-game.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323911-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-these-big-bird-creatures-are.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323912-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-flying-through-obstacles-while.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323913-ordyne-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-second-boss.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/RSvtGl1.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Out Live (Japan)">		<description>Out Live (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FOut%20Live%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="180211" />		<title_clean>Out Live</title_clean>		<plot>A very important discovery was recently made on the planet Laffra - ancient ruins at an excavation site, containing relics of another civilization, with technique that would surely benefit the great intergalactic Empire. But a mysterious organization that calls itself "Mars" began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as "FW", into the depths of the ruins, to face the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge...[CR]Out Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are also machines and robots of different kinds. [CR]Before venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot's energy. Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points.[CR]A somewhat unusual feature is "double leveling": the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.</plot>		<releasedate>17/3/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>SunSoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.8</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589060-out-live</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/out-live</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/out-live/3030-40761/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2382368-out_live_pce.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482580-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482581-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-lots-of-text-not-a-single.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482582-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-main-pre-dungeon-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482583-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-welcome-to-the-shop.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482584-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-we-need-guns.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482585-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-hitting-the-bar-hearing.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482586-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-it-s-time-to-go.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482588-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-enemy-encounter-battle-menu.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482589-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-status-screen.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482590-out-live-turbografx-16-screenshot-enemy-is-defeated-getting.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Out Run (Japan)">		<description>Out Run (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FOut%20Run%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="334688" />		<title_clean>Out Run</title_clean>		<plot>[CR]Development[CR]The inspiration behind the development of OutRun was born out of two things. The first was to overturn Namco, the developer (at the time) of the hugely successful Pole Position and a company synonymous with racing titles, to make Sega Japan's leading manufacturer of racing games. The second, surprisingly, was Yu Suzuki's love of the Burt Reynolds movie Cannonball Run. Suzuki states "The main impetus behind OutRun's creation was my love of a film called Cannonball Run. I thought it would be good to make a game like that."[CR]Suzuki took the development process very seriously and wanted to visit the locations where the courses and levels of his game would pass through. The film Cannonball Run is a pan-American road-race and Suzuki made plans to follow the same course and collect photographic, video and audio data along the way. However, he quickly realized there was a problem:[CR]"The film crosses America, so I made a plan to follow the same course and collect data as I went. But I realized, once I'd arranged everything, that the scenery along the course actually doesn't change very much so I revised my plan and decided to collect data in Europe instead..."[CR]Innovations[CR]OutRun departed significantly from Namco's popular Pole Position formula. This is most significant in how OutRun moved the setting away from the racing circuits towards the streets, with oncoming traffic, making it the first true street racing game, paving the way for modern street racers such as Need For Speed and Burnout.Force Feedback[CR]There were four versions of the OutRun arcade cabinet, Deluxe and Standard moving models, an upright with a force-feedback wheel and a cockpit version without any movement.[CR]The early classic Arcade machine for OutRun, featured force-feedback. If the side of a wall was hit the player would get a slight jolt, but completely wipe out and reveal the mistake to everyone else present. The rumble brought a sense of immersion that most other arcade games lacked at the time.Multiple Paths[CR]OutRun also featured a unique way to play through the game. At the end of each area (or checkpoint) the road would fork left and right. The way the player chose to go would decide if the next track is more difficult or less difficult. Some areas and paths were much more difficult than others, so it is best to choose wisely. Each path features different endings, most of which are often humorous.Gradient[CR]Out Run was the first racing game to introduce the use of gradients, with the car climbing uphill and downhill along the course. The camera angle through which the player views the car was also significantly lower than other racing games, with a more over-the-shoulder viewpoint directly behind the car, giving it the feel of being in a car where the driver cannot see what is above or below a certain gradient, thus keeping the players always on their toes and bringing more excitement to the gameplay. The game was praised for these innovations.[CR]Success[CR]The game's main competitor in 1986 was rival Konami's more traditional WEC Le Mans, which was initially the favourite at the time for its more sophisticated hydraulic cabinet. It was OutRun, however, which went on to become the much more popular game, selling more than 20,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, for hundreds of millions of dollars, along with ports to numerous home platforms.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>30/6/1986</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>NEC Avenue</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>An1gUPqqBVg</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>26094</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589061-outrun</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/outrun</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/outrun/3030-11260/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10346</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/26094-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1614/945331-outrun_gen_jp_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97710-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97711-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-choose-your-tune.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97712-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-prepare-to-race.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97713-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-approaching-a-crowd.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97714-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-a-sign-tells-you-to-steer-left.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97715-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-spinning-out-of-control.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97716-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-crashed-into-a-tree.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97717-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage-2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97718-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage-3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97719-outrun-turbografx-16-screenshot-stage-4.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/YtJwJnN.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Override (Japan)">		<description>Override (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FOverride%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="144576" />		<title_clean>Override</title_clean>		<plot>Sci-fi vertically scrolling shoot 'em up.[CR]HINTS:[CR]- Level select mode -[CR]Enter the "Level Select Mode" code before entering the level password.[CR]Hold Run and press Select ten times[CR]- Sound Test, Invincibility and Ending -[CR](At the title Screen, reset 10 times and then enter the following codes at the title screen)[CR]Holding up-left, I, II, Select, press Run : Ending[CR]Press Run, then quickly press and hold I, II, Select &amp;

It was also ported to many consoles and in 1996 was included in Namco Museum Vol 4 for the PlayStation. The arcade game used the Namco Pac-Land system board, which was also used in Dragon Buster, Metro-Cross, Baraduke and Sky Kid. Pac-Land also featured parallax scrolling for some of its backgrounds, which was not commonplace until the 16-bit era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game centers around getting a fairy to the end of the stage and eventually back to the Queen Fairy in Fairyland. Since there were the five ghosts (Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue) that kept chasing Pac-Man, the fairy was tucked away safely under the hat that Pac-Man was wearing. Together they venture right and left, completing levels and avoiding dangerous obstacles like quicksand, water and the ghosts themselves.[CR]For bonus points, the player can collect cherries and other items. Also, there is an power pellet on each stage that Pac-Man can collect. That turns the ghosts blue. Then the ghost consuming can begin...[CR]When the player has made it to the end of the final stage, they are awarded with a pair of magical boots. Those are helpful, as they allow continuous jumps in the air as Pac-Man returns home. Once he is home, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. If playing the US release, Pac-Man is also greeted by Sourpuss and Chomp-Chomp (from the Pac-Man cartoon).[CR]Then, if the player chooses, Pac-Man starts another journey with the same objective but with increased difficulty.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Options, Sound Test and Stage Select[CR]At the title screen, hold Button 1 + Button 2 and press Run. You'll enter the secret Game Options where you can increase your lives and turn "Skip" (level select) on. If you press Run again, you'll access the Sound Test. Press Run one last time to go back to the title screen. To enable the Stage Select, turn "Skip" on, go back to the title screen and start the game.

Move it a little, stop, and then continue moving it as far as it'll go and Pac-Man will be upside down. Move the stump all the way without stopping and Pac-Man will walk backwards. Move the stump most of the way, stop, then finish moving the stump and Pac-Man will both be upside down and walk backwards (All of this works in the Turbo Grafx 16 version only). </plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Technologies</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.8</rating>		<videoid>aYJ0CD3R7iw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>5679</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589066-pac-land</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/pac-land</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pac-land/3030-8575/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10273</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5679-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5679-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40298-pac-land-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98110-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen-us-version.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98111-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-coming-down-the-mountain.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98113-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-i-ve-encountered-a-magical.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98115-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-you-can-stand-on-ghosts.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98116-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-returning-home.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98119-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-later-levels-bring-different.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98124-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-round-1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98125-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-power-pellet.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98126-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-break-time.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98128-pac-land-turbografx-16-screenshot-tiny-cacti.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/DFPvmIV.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/5679.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pachio-kun - Juuban Shoubu (Japan)">		<description>Pachio-kun - Juuban Shoubu (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FPachio-kun%20-%20Juuban%20Shoubu%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="349042" />		<title_clean>Pachio-kun - Juuban Shoubu</title_clean>		<plot>Role-playing adventure played out through a series of Pachinko games.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Pachio-kun_Juban.htm[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<genre>Card</genre>		<studio>Coconuts Japan</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589064-pachiokun-juban-shobu</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pachiokun-juban-shobu/3030-51539/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2798528-1122039098-31909.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/9/3/319093_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/7/e/gfs_4816_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/e/3/gfs_4816_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/3/3/gfs_4816_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>	</game>	<game name="Paranoia (Japan)">		<description>Paranoia (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FParanoia%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="138837" />		<title_clean>Paranoia</title_clean>		<plot>Strange and (at times) very surreal shooter.

Now, get to level 4 without losing a life, and a giant turtle will appear and act as your shield.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>Naxat Soft</studio>		<videoid>_11XA8nfHNQ</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8224</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/917248-psychosis</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/psychosis/3030-10833/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10272</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8224-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8224-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716633-psychosis002.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716632-psychosis001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716631-psychosis_%28u%29-003.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716630-psychosis_%28u%29-002.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716629-psychosis_%28u%29-001.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716628-paranoia_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/f/0/gfs_4871_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/2/2/gfs_48169_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/6/d/gfs_4871_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/b/d/gfs_4871_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/WTsb6d6.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble 3 (Japan)">		<description>Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble 3 (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FParasol%20Stars%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20Bubble%20Bobble%203%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="240836" />		<title_clean>Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble 3</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Parasol Stars is a 1991 single-screen platformer that follows from Bubble Bobble, starring Bub and Bob in the human forms they used in Rainbow Islands. The game is far more like its older antecedent than its immediate predecessor, once again confining the action to single-screen areas and manipulating water flows to flush out enemies and collect sweets for points. Released initially on the PC Engine (and the US TurboGrafx-16), other versions followed for the NES and Game Boy and home computers the Commodore Amiga and the Atari ST. Unlike its forebears, Parasol Stars was never an Arcade game.[CR]In Parasol Stars, the player again assumes the role of Bub and Bob in their human form, now equipped with parasols they can use to balance enemies and water droplets over their heads. The player is able to use the parasols to pick up monsters after either hitting them or waiting for them to fall on top of them, and then launch them to the opposite side of the screen. They can also collect water droplets and drop them, creating a torrent of water that drains off the bottom of the screen, washing away any enemies caught in it - doing this with several enemies at once is how the player creates combos for higher scores. Enemies vary from world to world: The musically-themed World 1, for example, has sentient trumpets, pianos and cymbals.[CR]Like Bubble Bobble, Parasol Stars' most distinctive features are the large, colorful sprites, the cheery music and the single-screen puzzle-platformer action. As always, clearing the screen creates a bunch of point-enhancing pick-ups and will eventually move you to the next screen. There are also boss fights, most of which require flinging water or enemies at the boss to hurt them.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock The Real Last Level[CR]Finish the last stage (Rainbow World) with 3 Star Miracle Icons and you'll automatically go to the real last stage instead of getting the bad ending.</plot>		<releasedate>9/5/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Working Designs</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<videoid>KzYmT2TYE-I</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8222</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589068-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii/3030-10496/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/12477</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8222-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8222-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79179-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110314-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110315-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110316-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110317-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110318-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110319-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110320-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110321-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110322-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/110323-parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-turbografx-16.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/DDVtokY.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III (USA)">		<description>Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FParasol%20Stars%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20Bubble%20Bobble%20III%20%28USA%29.zip" size="241237" />		<title_clean>Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Parasol Stars is a 1991 single-screen platformer that follows from Bubble Bobble, starring Bub and Bob in the human forms they used in Rainbow Islands.

On a journey through prehistoric lands, this is your main defense against the crazed dinosaurs out to get you. But it's not your only defense, as now and again you will come across huge chunks of meat that grant you increased powers - from the ability to freeze all enemies by head-butting the ground, to a limited period of invincibility - complete with wacky music.[CR]Your cranial skills also come in handy when you are required to jump a long distance, as hitting the attack button as fast as you can will make you somersault in mid-air and increase your jumping range. On your way, you will come across several different types of plant. Yellow ones act as a sort of springboard, and red ones spit out fruit - be careful though as some will transform into an evil plant and come hopping after you. Also, points can be gained by keeping enemies in the air by repeatedly head-butting them - something to remember as points mean lives.[CR]NOTE ABOUT THE NAME:[CR]In Japan, Bonk/PC Kid is called PC Genjin. Genjin means pithecanthrope or primitive man which ties in nicely with the PC (Pithecanthropus Computerurus). This also leads to name-play in future projects like CD Denjin/PC Denjin (Air Zonk) where Den means lightning or electricity and Jin means a person. Genjin is also played with in CD Denjin's title song, which mentions being a 'Genhead' with the Gen coming from Genjin (and possibly a play on 'Gunhed'?). However, the name 'PC Kid' is the original intended English language name (before US marketing bods came up with 'Bonk'), as it has appeared (in English) in the Japanese literature. Got all that?[CR]COMMENT:[CR]While graphically and sonically a little 'primitive' (ahem), PC Genjin is a truly brilliant game, and pretty large too. There's something about whapping baddies with your forehead that is great fun throughout and you really get a satisfaction every time you complete the game - and you will come back to it time and time again. This is one of the games that no Engine owner should be without (and the reason I bought one in the first place) and despite the superior visual look of the sequels, this is still the best in terms of gameplay.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/PC_Kid.htm[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<genre>Platform</genre>		<studio>Hudson</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.6</rating>		<videoid>6ZGC0FSZmRg</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3777</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588909-bonks-adventure</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3777-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3777-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/3777-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/9/6/gfs_4308_1_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/c/gfs_40521_1_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/b/gfs_4308_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/b/gfs_4308_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/b/gfs_4308_2_3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/7/b/gfs_4308_2_4.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/c/b/gfs_4308_2_5.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/1/b/gfs_4308_2_6.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/a/b/gfs_4308_2_7.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3777-1.jpg</fanart1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3777.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="PC Genjin 2 - Pithecanthropus Computerurus (Japan)">		<description>PC Genjin 2 - Pithecanthropus Computerurus (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FPC%20Genjin%202%20-%20Pithecanthropus%20Computerurus%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="350951" />		<title_clean>PC Genjin 2 - Pithecanthropus Computerurus</title_clean>		<plot>Following closely from the original, PC Genjin 2 keeps the formula and makes a few tweaks, such as different power-up characters and limiting your ability to somersault as fast as before.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]The sequel bumps the graphics up to scratch and introduces more crazy bosses and bonus stages.

Firstly, you can now enjoy the game with a friend with 2 player simultaneous play. And secondly, you now have the ability to transform your size to either tiny or huge with coloured sweets that are strewn about the area. The setting has moved on from the primitive era, and you now find yourself adventuring into boats, sewers and houses, complete with giant cakes and mutant babies.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]The new 'super-size' mode in PC Genjin 3 is certainly impressive, although it adds little to the actual gameplay compared to the tiny mode which is necessary for access to certain areas. By this stage, the series is starting to feel a little tired, but while this is undoubtedly the weakest of the three games, it still reeks of quality, is fun to play and miles better than many other platform games on the system.[CR]REVIEWER:[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/PC_Kid_3.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]First enter the "Cheat Menu" code.

Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover Art[CR]Aside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black &amp; White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.[CR]The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of "retaining the feel" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)[CR]The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.[CR]Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit.ModesA mysterious confidant congratulates the player between missions.[CR]Populous has three main modes of play: Tutorial, Conquest, and Custom. The Tutorial mode consists of a preset map designed more than anything to allow players to familiarize themselves with the game's controls and the various powers at their disposal. Conquest is the main mode of Populous, which allows players to progress through a series of 500 maps, conquering one world at a time before moving on to the next. Player performance is key to progression in this mode, as the player does not simply progress in linear fashion through each map. Rather, the player's score at the end of each mission is taken as an indicator of one's relative skill, and the difficulty of the next mission is chosen as a direct reflection of said score. Mission objective do not change over the course of Conquest mode, though the aptitude of one's opposition (as well as the powers available to them) will increase over time. Several different terrain types come into play as well, though their effects on gameplay is decidedly subtle. Settlers can die more easily on a desert world, for example, and population growth is stunted on an ice planet. Though the player can save their game at any time, the name of each planet also serves as a password of sorts, allowing players to jump to a specific world by simply inputting its name. The final mode of play is Custom, which pulls triple duty of serving as the game's portal for playing scenarios with customized parameters, creating custom maps, and also connecting to a second player (via modem) for multiplayer skirmishes.Inspecting the Game WorldThe Information Shield, complete with Population Bars (sides)[CR]Seeing as the player has no real dominion over the individual activities of worshipers, various tools are provided to allow players to quickly survey their surroundings and also gauge the level of efficacy of followers and buildings. Individual targets can be selected at any time by using the Query button, which causes a shield icon to appear next to the selected object. This indicates that any information appearing in the upper-right status shield pertains specifically to this target (which can in turn be located at any time by using the Zoom to Shield button). The status shield is divided into four quadrants. The quadrant in the upper left simply indicates which side the selected target belongs to, with an ankh signifying good, and a skull signifying evil. The quadrant to its right shows the target's level of sophistication, with more advanced weapon icons indicating a greater level of technology. The lower left quadrant shows a representation of the selected target, while the lower right displays two bars. In the case of a building, these bars show overall defense in yellow on the left, and progress toward production of the next follower in green on the right. In the case of followers, two orange bars showing unit strength fill over time. Once both bars have been filled, the left bar changes to yellow, indicating that it is gauging higher strength values than before. On either side of the Information Shield are two additional bars which show the population size of both the good and evil players on the left and right sides respectively.QueryQueryThe Query button allows the player to quickly ascertain the strength of a given target, whether they be friendly or hostile. Querying a target will persist until another target is queried, so it is possible, for instance, to use it as an easy way to keep track of an opposing leader's activities, or, when used with Zoom to Shield, to be able to quickly shift focus to a location of the player's choosing.Zoom to ShieldZoom to ShieldThe Zoom to Shield command serves to quickly refocus the player's field of view upon the last queried target. Naturally, if the player has yet to use the Query function, the Zoom to Shield icon does nothing. This mainly serves to allow players to quickly see something that might not be covered by other Zoom functions.Zoom to LeaderZoom to LeaderPressing the Zoom to Leader button, unsurprisingly, centers the player's view upon the leader of their followers. If the player's people are currently leaderless, then this function will center the field of view upon the player's Papal Magnet, usually the site of their leader's demise, until such time as a new leader has been chosen.Zoom to KnightZoom to KnightThe function of the Zoom to Knight button changes depending on whether the player left- or right-clicks. Upon left-clicking, it will cycle between all knights that the player currently possesses; when right-clicking, however, it will rotate its focus instead through all of the player's various settlements.Zoom to BattleZoom to BattleA simple click of the Zoom to Battle button will jump the camera instantly to any active hostile engagements, and, if there are more than one, it will cycle between all confrontations upon additional clicks. Like most Zoom functions, if there are no valid targets to jump to, pressing the button has no effect.Divine Mandates[CR]Though no true control is given over one's followers (alternately called walkers) in Populous, as the object of their worship the player is given the prerogative to direct the focus of their attentions. There are four options for influencing the behavior of walkers, and regardless of which is chosen, the player's people will dutifully endeavor to conform to this mandate in order to better satisfy their god. Directives do not require manna in the same way that physical manifestations of power do, though at the same time their effects are not nearly as dramatic nor as immediate.Go to MagnetGo to MagnetThe Go to Magnet command instructs all followers to gather around their leader, who will in turn go toward the Papal Magnet. In situations where the player's leader has died, this instructs followers to head directly toward the Magnet, where the first follower to touch the Magnet will be appointed the new leader.SettleSettleFaithful who have been directed to settle will look around their environment for suitable land upon which to erect new buildings, with preference being given for unexplored areas. Regardless of where they choose to settle, settlers will always construct the largest settlement that their particular plot of land allows.Gather TogetherGather TogetherThe Gather Together function implores a player's followers to search for others of their tribe so that they might commune with them. If successful, the two walkers will band together, forming a single more powerful unit. If unsuccessful in finding others, a follower will simply attempt to construct more settlements.FightFightWalkers that have been instructed to fight will actively search for any non-allied units and attempt to defeat them before repeating the process. Much like the Gather Together mandate, if a follower is unable to find suitable targets in its immediate vicinity, it will choose instead to build new settlements.Divine Intervention[CR]Often it is required that a god take matters into its own hands, and for these situations there are a variety of choices for direct intervention. Just below the player's Information Shield is the Manna Bar, which shows what godly powers are currently available for use. Various icons representing specific powers are arrayed along this bar, and once the Manna Bar's indicator arrow has reached the icon for a specific power, this indicates that it can be used. These range from minor displays like slightly modifying the height of land to more cataclysmic ones like Armageddon. Having a larger number of followers will raise the manna indicator arrow quicker and also allow for more frequent use of powers, as manna can be replenished more quickly with more devotees.Raise/Lower LandRaise/Lower LandThe least expensive and ironically most important of the godly powers is the ability to raise and lower land, which helps primarily to make the environment more habitable for one's followers. Left-clicking while in this mode will raise the plot of land where the player's cursor currently resides, while right-clicking will lower it.Papal MagnetPapal MagnetPlacing a Papal Magnet on any are of the map will designate that point as a beacon to which allied followers are drawn. When a leader dies or is knighted, the Papal Magnate's position is fixed to the last place that the leader occupied, and cannot be repositioned until the player has appointed a new leader through the Go to Magnet command.EarthquakeEarthquakeThe Earthquake ability randomly rearranges all tiles withinin the player's current field of view, disrupting settlements and any other activities within the area. As the cheapest disruption spell available in most scenarios, it is one of the more common ways of hindering the development of rival walkers.SwampSwampUse of the Swamp ability creates a swamp on any flat surface within the field of view. Depending on mission parameters, this will swallow up either a single walker or all walkers who attempt to traverse it. Swamp tiles can only be destroyed by raising or lowering the land tile upon which they are situated.KnightKnightBy invoking the Knight ability, the player's current leader is transformed into a powerful knight that will tirelessly harass the enemy, killing walkers and burning settlements to the ground until it is killed. It is possible for a player to have multiple knights concurrently by selecting and knighting new leaders through the Papal Magnet.VolcanoVolcanoThe area within the field of view is dramatically raised and filled with rocky obstructions when the player summons a volcano. Use of this ability is primarily a disruption tactic much like the use of Earthquake, though the effects are much more time-consuming to reverse than its cheaper cousin.FloodFloodUnlike most land-altering invocations, Flood affects the entire map rather than limiting itself to only the player's field of view, raising the water level of the entire world by one. Special care should be taken before using it to ensure that one's own population won't be more adversely affected by this than the enemy's.ArmageddonArmageddonEssentially a game-ender, Armageddon razes all buildings on the map and calls all followers to the center of the level in order to wage a winner-takes-all showdown in which the player left standing is the ultimate victor. For players who are sure of their own tribe's superiority, this can save a significant amount of hassle.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft Company</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Isometric</perspective>		<rating>4.2</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589071-populous</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/populous</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/populous/3030-6210/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/118253/2065327-populous_na_box_art.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/97784-populous-turbografx-16-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/97785-populous-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/324356-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643342-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-houses.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643343-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-mountains-terrain-is-useless.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643344-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-big-sign.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643345-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-fight.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643346-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-knight-is-powerful-unit.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643347-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-game-won.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643348-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-sands-sands-everywhere.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643349-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-time-to-dismount-mointain.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643350-populous-turbografx-16-screenshot-castles.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Power Drift (Japan)">		<description>Power Drift (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FPower%20Drift%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="248973" />		<title_clean>Power Drift</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Designed by Yu Suzuki and developed by Sega AM2 for the Arcades in 1988, Power Drift was the first kart racer, setting the template for more popular kart racers such as the Mario Kart series. The Sonic Drift series is, in many ways, a spiritual successor to Power Drift.[CR]The game was notable for its sprite-scaling graphics, which Yu Suzuki and Sega had used to great success with earlier racers like Hang-On and OutRun. It used them to create elaborate, surreal courses that seemed to rise and fall rapidly like rollercoasters.[CR]Power Drift was later ported to multiple home computers by Activision and to the PC Engine exclusively in Japan by Asmik Entertainment.

The player selects between Stroke Play (the single-player), a Match Play (competition with a computer player) or Competition (competition between two or three human players in a hotseat mode). The player(s) then chooses their golfer (between a female and two male characters) and plays a standard eighteen hole game of golf.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with many golf console games of the era, the player is required to select the club they wish to use and the direction they wish to hit the ball towards. They then have to tap the button twice on a power gauge: once at the top of the swing and the second at the moment the club hits the ball. With the right timing, the ball will fly a fair distance in the desired direction. If the timing is off, the ball will not go quite so far and may even hook or slice to the side. The player must also be wary of regular golf course hazards such as sand bunkers and bodies of water.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft Company</studio>		<nplayers>1-3 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>8223</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589075-power-golf</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/power-golf</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/power-golf/3030-20949/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/1790464-power_golf__u_.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8223-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/185437-power-golf-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/466025-power-golf-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/466026-power-golf-turbografx-16-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/466027-power-golf-turbografx-16-screenshot-player-selection.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/466028-power-golf-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-area-is-shown-completely.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/466029-power-golf-turbografx-16-screenshot-hitting-the-ball.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/466030-power-golf-turbografx-16-screenshot-flight-of-the-ball.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2712452-powergolf001.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2490938-power+golf+%28u%29-003.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2490937-power+golf+%28u%29-002.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2490936-power+golf+%28u%29-001.png</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Power League (Japan) (All Star Version)">		<description>Power League (Japan) (All Star Version)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FPower%20League%20%28Japan%29%20%28All%20Star%20Version%29.zip" size="121713" />		<title_clean>Power League</title_clean>		<plot>World Class Baseball is a Sports game, developed and published by Hudson,which was released in Japan in 1988.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Team[CR]At the Vs Mode or Edit Mode team selection screen, hold Select and press I to pick your team.

/>		<title_clean>Psycho Chaser</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Psycho Chaser is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up that features an android protagonist who strides up the screen. It was Sting Entertainment's first video game: the developer would later be better known for their JRPGs like Baroque and Yggdra Union. The player character, the eponymous Psycho Chaser, is a sophisticated android warrior with multiple built-in weapons that was designed to combat an AI that has gone out of control.[CR]The game was a PC Engine exclusive for almost two decades until it was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008. Neither version of the game was released outside of Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Psycho Chaser has four weapons that it can switch between at any point which offers different amounts of screen coverage: Fire, Multiway, Blaster and Thunder. Each can be upgraded up to three times between levels by collecting and spending "Psycho Energy".Fire is a straight vertical shot with a high level of power. Upgrades make it more powerful.Multiway fires in three directions: diagonally forward left, diagonally forward right and behind. It's a weaker weapon, but capable of hitting multiple targets in awkward positions. As it is upgraded, it adds additional directions.Blaster is a circular wave beam that attacks enemies directly to the left and right of Psycho Chaser. Upgrades increases the size of the waves.Thunder is a homing attack that automatically targets and chases whichever enemy is closest after being fired. It remains on the screen for a while, preventing the player from firing until it has vanished. Upgrades make it stronger, allowing it to destroy enemies faster.[CR]In addition, the player can collect power-ups which fire additional missiles with every shot. They spread out from Psycho Chaser and then fly up the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Full Power &amp;amp; 4 way split screen &amp;amp; Ending[CR]First reset the game 35 times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Full Power &amp;amp; 4 way split screen &amp;amp; Ending[CR]Full Power[CR]At the weapon status screen enter the code below[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Full Power &amp;amp; 4 way split screen &amp;amp; Ending[CR]4 way split screen[CR]At the title screen enter the code below[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Full Power &amp;amp; 4 way split screen &amp;amp; Ending[CR]Ending[CR]At the level select screen (see separate cheat) enter the code below[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Full Power &amp;amp; 4 way split screen &amp;amp; Ending[CR]Level Select[CR]At the Sound Test screen (see separate cheat), select '1F' and enter the code below.

It is being taken over by the Devil Ugar himself! Your only recourse is to fight back against this hostile invasion. Thankfully your mind has created the ultimate weapon: a ship with which you can navigate the five causes (stages) and blast back the Devil's evil minions. It is your only hope, your one last chance to free your mind from this evil influence.[CR]Psychosis is a side-scrolling shooter where each level is meant to represent a different location within your mind. One looks like the sky, another filled with aquatic plants, one with what resemble tetris blocks. It is within these stages that you must blast everything in sight while collecting power ups to upgrade your weapon and shield. You can gain two floating balls that resemble mechanical eyes and can be directed 360 degrees around your ship to either act as a shield or to direct your weapon. Battle your way through each stage and defeat the boss at the end and eventually you'll do battle against the very DEVIL himself.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen, press Run to start the game. While the screen is fading to black, hold Button 2. The screen will stay black as long as you hold the button. Now, press the Run button 5 times to go to level 2, 45 times for level 3, 25 times for level 4 and 100 times for level 5.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Turtle Shield[CR]Right near the start of the first stage, you should see two enemies chasing and trying to kill a caterpillar near the bottom of the screen. Try shooting the enemies without shooting the caterpillar itself. If you did it right, you'll see a cocoon near the middle of the level and a bunch of butterflies will fly away when you reach the boss. Now, get to level 4 without losing a life, and a giant turtle will appear and act as your shield.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.[CR]There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)[CR]The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change Block Patterns[CR]At the Taito logo, hold Select + I + II.

The game was first released to Japanese arcades in July 1987. The player controls a spacecraft and is tasked with defending humanity against the alien life forms known as Bydo. R-Type is infamously known for its extreme difficulty.[CR]R-Type was originally released in the Arcades and became a major early hit for Irem. It was eventually ported to many home computers and consoles of the era, with the unusual exception of the NES (a bootleg Chinese cart exists, however). The PC Engine of R-Type was split across two releases, but the US TG-16 version manages to fit the whole game onto one HuCard. This TG16 version is also the one that was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.[CR]R-Type also saw multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as inspiring many future horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em ups.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Set in the 22nd century, the game takes place in the Bydo Empire. The player must make their way through the 8 merciless levels and defend mankind from the evil attackers. Bydo Dobkeratops - Boss of the first level[CR]The Bydo are biologically engineered weapons created by mankind to be used against their enemies in their quest for universal domination. This plan backfired however and the Bydo began to attack their creators. [CR] The Ship [CR]The player pilots a ship called the R-9a "Arrowhead". The ship is named for its distinctive shape and is the 9th model of the R series of star fighter. The Force[CR]The R-9a "Arrowhead" can be equipped with an indestructible living weapon called "The Force". The force, a spherical pod that can be attached to the ship, is made of Bydo flesh and can absorb energy in order to increase in power. To obtain the force, the player must obtain a weapon power up. The force will appear behind the players ship and they can obtain the force by flying into it. [CR]The force acts as the ship's weapon system and will fire in the whatever direction it is facing. The force also acts as a shield and can be used to block incoming enemy attacks. [CR]The force has three levels of power. Collecting weapon power ups increases the power level of the force. The forces visual appearance changes as it increases in power.Red - A powerful counter-air laser beam that fires horizontally.Blue - Three thin laser beams. One forward firing and two that fire at a 45 degree angle from the front of the ship These beams rebound off walls.Yellow - Two flame beams that fire above and below the ship. These flames can travel along the ground or walls to destroy enemies.[CR]The force can be controlled by the user by using the force button. By pressing the force button, the user can attach the force to the front or the rear of the ship. They can also propel the force forward to execute an attack called the "force ram". Wave Cannon[CR]The R9-a is equipped with a beam weapon called the wave cannon. Holding the fire button will charge up the wave cannon and increase its power.

Players control the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter in an attempt to defend humanity from a race of aliens that threaten the Earth.[CR]Raiden was originally released to the Arcades. It later saw a multitude of home conversions, with different degrees of fidelity to the source material. Many of these home versions became Raiden Trad (JP: Raiden Densetsu), a slightly modified version available for the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis and FM Towns Marty. Raiden for TurboGrafx-16 was one of the first straight ports, though is thought to be somewhat underwhelming due to the system's lack of power. An enhanced version for the TurboGrafx-CD, named Super Raiden, adds redbook audio and two new stages but doesn't address the technical shortcomings. Raiden also became available for Atari consoles the Lynx and the Jaguar, as well as for PC MS-DOS. Raiden was released along with Raiden II in The Raiden Project compilation for Sony PlayStation, a near-perfect conversion of the first two Arcade titles. Finally, the original Raiden was added to the Japanese PSN store for digital download.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like similar games from the era, Raiden is all about dodging enemy fire and powering up the ship. Players begin with a basic Vulcan attack and weak power, but can increase the strength of the weapon by collecting powerups dropped by certain ships. The two weapons in the game are the Red Vulcan and the Blue Laser, both of which can be powered up to eight times. The Vulcan has excellent range when fully upgraded, working as a spread cannon, while the Laser is a concentrated beam of destruction and can destroy enemies and bosses much quicker than the Vulcan. Other upgrades include two missile variants, Yellow "Dumbfire" Nuclear Missiles that do significant damage, Green Homing Missiles that can clear the field of smaller enemies, and bombs that can do immense damage on an opponent and eliminate enemy fire.[CR]The game consists of eight levels and upon completion of the eighth level, the player is given one million points. They are then sent back to the beginning with whatever armament the ship ended the game with, and start the game over from the beginning. Enemies however are much faster and more aggressive than the previous time and as a result, the game can be played indefinitely.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheats[CR]At the Continue screen, wait until the timer reaches Zero and press Run.

The player controls a small and odd looking ship named the "Macmillan MP4" as they battle through a variety of enemies looking to get rich. The "Macmillan MP4" is capable of holding three types of weapons which the player can cycle through as they choose by pressing the run button. The "I" button is a standard shot type which the Macmillan is always equipped with; the II button is whatever special weapon the player currently has equipped. Both shot types can be fired simultaneously.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game's fast-scrolling intro details the game's basic scenario: People have become bored with everyday life so some have started to search for the treasure (the FISA) of a lost civilization, termed the "ancient people". These bounty hunters are called "busters". The player-controlled protagonist is the buster most likely to succeed, a man named "Mr. Zella". Of course, this future society craves dangerous entertainment, so the whole thing has apparently been turned into some sort of television show for the entertainment of the masses; most of the enemies are likely placed by the makers of the show to increase the entertainment value for viewers. Prize money is apparently awarded for an exciting performance (although this has no effect on gameplay).[CR]Items[CR]There are a variety of items to be picked up; most are alternate weapons for the player's ship.Speed Up: Increases the ship's speed, up to 6 levels.Laser: Shoots powerful shots straight forward.2 way: Shoot bullets in two directions at an angle above and below the basic shot.3 way: Shoot bullets in three different directions.8 way: Shoot shots in eight different directions.Front fire: Shoots a powerful jet of flame from the front of the ship.Back fire: Shoots a powerful jet of flame from the rear of the ship.Fire ball: Shoots a powerful fireball.Crack: Shots which burst when they hit the enemy, resulting in large damage.Napalm: Shoots missiles that explode in a fiery burst.Lock On Missile: Perhaps this should be "rock on missile"? It destroys even the most powerful of enemies with a single shot, but it's also single-use.Twins: Twin missiles fired from the front of the ship.Froncrash: Turns the Macmillan itself in to a projectile. Dangerous!Snake: Fires a strong snaking chain of shots. Slow rate of fire, but powerful.Barrier: Creates a barrier around the ship which can absorb some damage.Warp: Pick this up to move to the next part of the stage.Reverse warp: Moves the player to an earlier point in the stage. Look out!1up: An extra life.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game has 4 "zones" which the player advances through in his search for the FISA and for the entertainment of the mindless masses.The Space Zone's boss.[CR]SPACE ZONE: The first zone is in space. The second half of the stage takes place in an asteroid field; the stage boss is a giant battleship the player repeatedly circles, ala R-Type's stage 3.[CR]DEJA-VU ZONE: This oddly named zone takes place over a cityscape as the sun sets. It is incredibly short; the boss is a small sphere which does very little.The Labyrinth Zone, filled with "FISA".[CR]LABYRINTH ZONE: No relation to the identically named area from Sonic, this zone begins in a cave-like environment. The player must maneuver carefully at points to avoid colliding with the terrain. Parts of the stage resemble a mechanized base, complete with pounding piston trips, and other parts are volcanic in nature. Eventually, the player arrives in an ancient temple; the boss is a large mechanical dragon.[CR]EXIT ZONE: The final zone. The player continues to advance through mostly cave-like environments, with some variations; the are accelerates progressively, similar to some of the Gradius high-speed stages. Eventually the protagonist escapes back in to space, only for enemies to continue to assault him. The final boss is a resilient blue robot. The player should attempt to grab as much of the treasure as they can at the beginning, as it is the goal of the protagonist's journey.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>Big Club</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>d68s6CgOHsE</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589089-rock-on</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/rock-on</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/rock-on/3030-33688/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10254</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/4/44493/1674295-rockonfront.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254824-rock-on-turbografx-16-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/577195-rock-on-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-story.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/577196-rock-on-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/577197-rock-on-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/577198-rock-on-turbografx-16-screenshot-let-s-go.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/577199-rock-on-turbografx-16-screenshot-blasting-action.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797264-rockon002.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797263-rock_on_%28j%29-015.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797262-rock_on_%28j%29-014.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797261-rock_on_%28j%29-013.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2797260-rock_on_%28j%29-012.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Jjj4nQu.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Ryuukyuu (Japan)">		<description>Ryuukyuu (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FRyuukyuu%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="152981" />		<title_clean>Ryuukyuu</title_clean>		<plot>Ryuukyuu is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Sankindo and published by Face,which was released in Japan in 1990.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra 256 Points[CR]Hold II and turn on the system.

The story, as with most games of this type, is unimportant and barely addressed. Lets get down to business shall we?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Overview - A side scrolling action game with a couple of nice twists. The first thing is that Moonlight can switch between four weapons at the outset of the game. The first is a Katana with short range but nice coverage, for it can both slash forward, upward, and stab down to hit enemies below you.[CR]The second are the shuriken, which can be thrown in 8 directions. The third is the kusarigama (a moon-shaped blade on a chain or rope), which is a solid distance weapon with 8 directional capability. Finally, the bomb, which can be thrown to explode on impact or set on the ground to explode a short time later. The sheer variety that you are given in the beginning lends an aspect that no other games of this type had at the time, but I'll get into that later.[CR]Along the way you are given access to ninja spirits, as the name of the game implies, which shadow and imitate your every movement. It's very handy when you have two spirits and upgraded weapons, at which point you become a lethal machine of destruction. The action has you facing down waves of enemies, utilizing your various weapons in each of their unique capacities, and facing a boss at the end of each level.[CR]The action in the game is executed very well, and the controls are intuitive.

When one were to name the source of many of the good titles during this era, Konami was very likely to come up in conversation. Unfortunately, Konami really didn't play much of a role in TurboGrafx-16 software on the stateside. The good news is that they did have a number of quality titles released in Japan that were perfect for import. One of these title is undoubtedly Salamander.[CR]Those of us in the US may be more used to hearing Salamander referred to as Life Force, since that was the name that the game took on when it was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In this follow-up to the classic shooter, Gradius, you and a friend battle it out with a heinous alien force. In fact, the game appears to take place within a very large alien life force.[CR]One of the first things that you'll notice about this game is that it is tougher than crap, even on the beginner difficulty level. If you're a shooter enthusiast who's looking for a challenge, you've found the game of your dreams. Not being a big shooter pro myself, I found it difficult even to advance beyond the first level of the game. However, those that are able to rise to the challenge will be rewarded for their prowess.[CR]From the very title screen of Salamander, you know that you're in for a quality game. The sound in this title is top notch for a HuCard. I have to give Konami props for making the most out of the hardware that they were given. This quality carries over to the graphics as well. For those of you Life Force fans out there, you're in for a treat. Taking advantage of the TurboGrafx's 16-bit graphics processor, the game looks much nicer than the NES version. Sure there is a bit of slow-down when things get intense, but that is to be expected when the screen is a frenzy of action.[CR]For those of you that follow turbografx.net regularly, you know that I'm a big proponent of the Turbo Tap. Salamander offers simultaneous two-player action, and you'll be needing all the help that you can get from a buddy on this one. On top of that, the other gameplay features are of the top notch quality that you would expect from Konami. The controls are very responsive and the power-up system is very generous.[CR]If you enjoy a good quality shooter, you can't go wrong with Salamander. Sure, there may be some frustration factor there for many of us that don't have enough skills to bring to the table, but it's a guarantee that you'll enjoy the game up to whatever point your skills can take you. Don't hestitate...snag a copy of Salamander today and thank me later!

Taira no Kagekiyo is once again compelled to seek out the demonic Genji clan that wiped out his own clan, the Heike, and destroy them. Both Kagekiyo and his enemies have supernatural powers, on top of their considerable martial ability.[CR]Samurai Ghost was released in Japan and the US for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1992, though the US did not receive the preceding game The Genji and the Heike Clans until years afterwards.

In this game, they do so by conquering their rivals at Mahjong.[CR]As with most other Mahjong simulators, this is an accurate portrayal of the classic Chinese board game, complete with detailed tiles and animated character portraits. It is four player, though two players are obscured by the sides of the screen (the player can move the camera to see their tile walls, but not the tiles themselves). As per usual Mahjong rules, the first player to put together a winning hand - either from the tiles they collect at the start of each turn or the discarded tiles of other players - wins the game.[CR]Though a Mahjong game set during the Warring States period was nothing new at the time, Sengoku Mahjong has the honor of being the first Mahjong game made for the Turbografx-16 system. As might be expected, it was never released outside of Japan. It was, however, rereleased on both the Wii's Virtual Console and PSN, in 2007 and 2009 respectively.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Select The Same Character[CR]Start a normal game (first option).

If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.[CR]Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy. Since Shanghai uses the same tileset as Mahjong and it is a one-player game, it is often called Mahjong Solitaire.[CR]This particular version was created in the late-80s and ported to various systems courtesy of Activision.

It would later make its way onto a number of other systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System. Shinobi saw multiple sequels for both the Arcade and for various Sega consoles.[CR]Joe Musashi is a master ninja sent on a mission to release hostages and defeat a powerful opponent in each region across the city. There is one hostage per level guarded by a large guard with a shield which can either be killed or circumvented. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Excuse me...[CR]While playing through the main levels Joe is able to pick up different power-ups which include ninja magic, health or extra lives. The ninja magic can be used to add different abilities to the protagonist such as ninja stars or flame strikes. A health bar is present at the top of the screen and will grow with power-ups. Each level is designed with increasing difficulty and while there may be no save option in the original Arcade version once a hostage is rescued they stay rescued. The player will only have to power through the regular enemies while making their way back to the point of death. Power-ups will not respawn.[CR]There are mini-games between the 5 missions and 19 rounds which have the camera looking from Joe's eyes in the first person. These mini-games have the player shooting ninja stars at anything from targets to flying ninjas who have some ninja stars of their own.[CR]Graphics[CR]The Two-Mega cartridge used for Shinobi was unable to handle the full animations from the arcade version, but most of the sprites were kept the same. The color count in each system was slightly different, the NES version being the lowest and the Arcade being the highest.[CR]Audio[CR]Different versions were again limited by their cartridge capacity and console.

It's very similar to Zelda II on the NES, only Zelda II is impossibly awesome and War of the Dead sucks.[CR]You play as a girl who... actually I don't know what's going on, everything is completely in Japanese. The only English I could find is the name of the guns! I, being the gun expert that I am, didn't need that translated. What I need translated is the part about who's responsible for the save system, so If I ever go to Japan I can be sure to drop by his house and congratulate him with a louisville slugger upside the head.[CR]The graphics are pretty good for how old the game is, they're a little better than NES, but not quite Genesis. It's pretty typical of old PC Engine games, it has that look to it. The one thing I wish PCEngine games had more of is parallax scrolling. It wouldn't do much for this game, but it would definitely make the battle scene graphics much better.[CR]REVIEWER: ArmamentArmedArm[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/turbo16/review/R26421.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Menu[CR]To access the debug menu, at the title screen, press Up, Left, Down, Right, I, II, II, I, Right, Down, Left, Up, Run.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Victor Interactive Software</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589161-war-of-the-dead</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/shiry-sensen-war-of-the-dead-</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/5/3/51953_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/5/3/51953_back.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205928-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482631-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482613-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482614-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-it.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482615-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-on.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482616-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-status.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482617-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-i-ve.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482618-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-battle.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482619-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-killed.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482620-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-game.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/482621-shiryo-sensen-war-of-the-dead-turbografx-16-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Shockman (USA)">		<description>Shockman (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FShockman%20%28USA%29.zip" size="290731" />		<title_clean>Shockman</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shockman (JP: Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 2: Atanaru Teki) is the second game in the Shubibinman series. The gameplay has changed dramatically from the first game. Tasuke and Kyapiko no longer use swords but exclusively use their shubibeams, which now resemble the mega buster in function. They can be shot rapidly or charged for a more powerful attack; in addition, it can be aimed upwards if necessary. In addition, Kyapiko and Tasuke are now capable of super attacks (provided they have a bit) and team-up charge attacks in two-player mode, with different results! [CR]Otherwise the basic gameplay remains similar, although the overworld map and some other play concepts have also been removed to make the game more exclusively action-oriented. In addition, the player will occasionally encounter a shooter-type stage with different mechanics. As another interesting note, many of the game's bosses were the winning results of a contest held for fans in Japan at the time!ItemsA bit. Red Battery: Restores a small amount of the player's life. Black Battery: Restores a large amount of the player's life. Bit: Allows Tasuke or Kyapiko to perform an ultimate attack so long as their HP is full; it's consumed with use.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kyapiko and Tasuke are on their way to school and work respectively when they are suddenly assaulted by violent construction robots! After quickly subduing these threats, a news broadcast indicates the Raio Empire is invading the world! Let's go, Shubibinman! [CR]Jeeta and Myu: Two other Shubibinmen of mysterious origins, known as the "Shubibiman Shades". They are under the thumb of Emperor Raio. Jeeta believes he is superior to Tasuke and Kyapiko and will interfere with the Raio Empire's plans to prove this. Myu, on the other hand, is gentle and non-combative.[CR]Emperor Raio: The evil leader and namesake of the Raio Empire. He is a fairly typical evil overlord type: Arrogant, over-confident and prone to gloating and evil laughter.[CR] [CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The stage 1 boss. [CR]Stage 1: The forces of the Raio Empire explode on to the city street! Tasuke and Kyapiko have to fight their way back to Dr. Goutokuji's lab. But a frighteningly designed battle ship of Raio won't make it easy! A mysterious figure witnesses their victory... [CR]Stage 2: Doctor Goutokuji provides the heroes with his latest invention: Battle submarines! Unfortunately the aliens had broken in to his base and kidnapped him; the message is merely a recording. Fight past the Naval forces of Raio and reach the Raio Empire's underwater installation... but look out for the boss, a series of bubbles with a robotic core called Yunohe. [CR]Stage 3: The heroes enter the Raio Empire's underwater base; this stage is auto-scrolling. After a ride along the currents, Tasuke and Kyapiko are attacked by a biomechanical water dragon! Defeating it only results in being swept further in to the base... Stage 4. [CR]Stage 4: Now deep inside the Raio Empire base, the Shubibinmen fight their way over pools of some kind of strange, energized liquid; falling in can be quite painful! Faced with another biomechanical beast as a mini-boss, they emerge victorious... but it was a trap set by Emperor Raio! Suddenly, that mysterious figure from earlier appears and frees them from the bubble... He introduces himself as Jeeta, and claims he will defeat the heroes another time! Tasuke and Kyapiko catch up to Raio, but he won't waste his time fighting them, and has them fight a large blue robot named Doke in his stead. Raio makes his mistake, and suddenly...[CR]Stage 5: The heroes convert to "flight mode", an ability Doctor Gotoukuji apparently installed without their knowledge! This is the second shooter stage in the game; the boss is a large alien warship which traps the heroes inside of a frame, which is re-shapes to make maneuvering difficult. Stage 6. [CR]Stage 6: Another Raio Empire base, this one seemingly in a mountainous area. Portions of the ceiling attempt to crush the heroes as they make their advance. As one gets further in to the base, it takes on a classical Japanese feel, with shoji screens and Japanese-themed enemies (i.e., robotic ninja, lantern robots, etc.). Jeeta waits at the end, eager to defeat the heroes! However, he makes his escape before he is truly defeated. [CR]Stage 7: A continuation of stage 6, the environment is quite similar. After scaling a shaft full of mechanical, fire-breathing oni head traps, the heroes encounter Myu. However, she doesn't want to fight, so Raio electrocutes her and sends out "Gold Face" instead! Myu seemingly dies...[CR]Stage 8: Continuing in the Raio Base, the heroes advance over a series of strange, steam-blasting engines only to encounter a gigantic robotic ninja guarding Professor Goutokuji! With the ninja defeated, the Professor agrees to try and fix Myu and makes some quick modifications to the heroes to allow them to fly in space, so as to pursue Emperor Raio. Good luck! Stage 9. [CR]Stage 9: The third shooter stage begins with the heroes passing through an asteroid field. Eventually they reach the Raio Mothership! After defeating a strange defense robot, they touch down and prepare to battle their way through the ship.[CR]Stage 10: Unsurprisingly, the ship is full of all sorts of automated defenses. After a long trek through, a furious Jeeta attacks the heroes, accusing them of murdering Myu! After his defeat, the heroes explain that Raio lied to him and in fact killed Myu himself. He swears to get revenge on Raio and tags along with the heroes! The final battle! [CR]Stage 11: Continuing the theme of stage 10, except now Jeeta is helping. The heroes travel up an elevator with spiked bars as a defense mechanism. At the top waits Raio; after killing Jeeta, he hops in to his own personal battle mecha to destroy the Shubibinmen himself! Can the heroes overcome the incredible power of Raio?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Refill Energy[CR]Enter this code when the game is paused.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Refill Energy[CR]After the ending is over, when the words "To be continued" appear on the screen, hold Select and press Up or Down to cycle between songs.</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NCS Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<videoid>vmxI1MlnM9U</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>8227</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589102-shockman</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/turbo-grafx/shockman</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/shockman/3030-33381/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10276</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8227-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8227-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323718-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323719-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-choose-arnold-or-sonya.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323720-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-intro-stage.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323721-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323722-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-robots-attack.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323723-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-dodge-the-flames.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323724-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-some-of-the-buildings-collapse.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323725-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-underwater-shooter-passage.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/323726-shockman-turbografx-16-screenshot-attacking-large-squid-like.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2722952-3689133278-QoaSN.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/boWDKfz.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Shougi Shodan Icchokusen (Japan)">		<description>Shougi Shodan Icchokusen (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FShougi%20Shodan%20Icchokusen%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="165766" />		<title_clean>Shougi Shodan Icchokusen</title_clean>		<plot>Shogi Shodan Icchokusen is a Miscellaneous game, published by Home Data,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>10/8/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Board Game</genre>		<studio>Home Data</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589103-shogi-shodan-icchokusen</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/9/8/319098_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/e/7/gfs_5233_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/7/a/gfs_5233_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>	</game>	<game name="Shougi Shoshinsha Muyou (Japan)">		<description>Shougi Shoshinsha Muyou (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FShougi%20Shoshinsha%20Muyou%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="144779" />		<title_clean>Shougi Shoshinsha Muyou</title_clean>		<plot>Serious Shougi board game.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Shogi_Shoshinsha_Muyo.htm[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>		<genre>Board Game</genre>		<studio>Home Data</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589104-shogi-shoshinsha-muyou</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/9/9/319099_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/b/9/gfs_5339_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/2/4/gfs_5339_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>	</game>	<game name="SideArms - Hyper Dyne (USA)">		<description>SideArms - Hyper Dyne (USA)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FSideArms%20-%20Hyper%20Dyne%20%28USA%29.zip" size="165877" />		<title_clean>SideArms - Hyper Dyne</title_clean>		<plot>Forerunner to Forgotten Worlds.

The player assumes the role of an unnamed pink tube that moves by flipping over (like a Slinky) and can shoot from its sides. It can shoot in multiple directions, depending on how it is positioned, and is able to climb walls and across ceilings, as well as jump from one surface to another. The goal of each stage is to quickly make it to where the boss of the area resides and then destroy them.

The player can enter their birthdate when starting the game, and once they meet the boss that corresponds to their astrological star sign, it will spit out power-ups instead of damaging bullets, effectively becoming a freebie.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Black and White mode[CR]At the Sound Screen , Press SELECT, UP,Up,DOWN,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,LEFT,RIGHT,II,I.

Unlike the first game, which played like a ground-based scrolling shoot-'em-up with several floors the character could switch between, Son Son II plays much more like a traditional platformer, specifically Wonder Boy and even more overtly Capcom's earlier arcade game Black Tiger. Son Son attacks with his extendable staff (based on Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang weapon) and can defeat enemies to earn coins, which can be spent on upgrades and health refills. The player also needs to find a key on each stage before they can reach the boss.[CR]The goal of the game is to rescue the other members of his party: Xuanzang (Tripitaka), Pigsy and Sandy. They are kidnapped during the opening cutscene by the final boss, who is depicted as a mysterious silhouette.[CR]Son Son II is also one of the earliest Capcom games to use Zenny, their trademark fictional currency.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Misc.

Well, they went and made one anyway. this is one of those brain melting puzzle games that some will love and some will despise.[CR]Each level you are presented with a room with boxes and spots, which are where the boxes should end up. You can push the boxes, but not pull them and you really have to plan in advance to stop getting, um...'boxed' in. If you feel you've taken a bit of a wrong turn, you can simply push a button and rewind your moves. But as well as countless levels of box-shoving there's also a level editor that allows you to create your own levels of fun and frustration.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]I have to admit up front that I really don't enjoy puzzle games that require a lot of mental forethought (so I'd be pretty useless at chess no doubt). Presentation is good enough, with each set of levels in a different 'country' with some mini animations thrown in now and again. Graphics are obviously simplistic, but they aren't distractingly poor. The music is actually quite good - far better than I would have expected.[CR]I only can tolerate games like this up to the point where I get stuck, so it doesn't have a great amount of appeal for me. But on the plus side, at least there is no time limit.

It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!"The game takes place in a unique place called the "Fantasy Zone" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 5,000,000 points.The arcade version.The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can.Stages:The third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: AbsymbelThe bonus stage.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the "rolling" cabinet. The "rolling" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012.[CR]Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware[CR]The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles.Technical specificationsCPU (Central Processing Unit) mother boardMain CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MBSuper Scaler GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) boardGPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was ported to several Sega consoles, such as the Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as "Sega Ages: Space Harrier" is also a pretty faithful version of the game. This version of the game also appeared in the US with two other games on a compilation disc simply called Sega Ages.The two Master System versions, including Space Harrier 3-D, reduced the graphical quality and speed quite a bit, but still managed to be a recognizable port of the original game. The first Master System version, released in 1986, was the first home video game cartridge to feature 2 Megabits (256 Kilobytes) of memory. The second Master System version, Space Harrier 3-D, featured the use of stereoscopic 3D graphics. The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as "Haya Oh." This new boss fight also appears in the X68000 version of the game. The Game Gear version of the game shares some of the basic quality issues as the Master System release, but contains different levels, an adjusted resolution, and a password system for continuing from later levels.Space Harrier, featured in Shenmue.The game was also featured in the game Shenmue. Space Harrier was located in the "You Arcade" building in the Dobuita area of the game; the player has to pay one-hundred yen to play the game. The "Sega Saturn" version of Space Harrier was also featured as a prize in the raffle in some of the convenience stores. The Sega Saturn version can be played on Ryo's Sega Saturn that is located in his living room.A polygonal remake of the game was made as part of Sega's Sega Ages series in Japan. The polygonal version of Space Harrier was released outside of Japan in the form of Sega Classics Collection.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Arcade versionThe arcade game was well received upon release. It became one of 1986's chart hits in the arcades. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the arcade game in its March 1986 issue, after reviewer Clare Edgeley played it at the 1986 ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in London, along with the arcade version of Super Mario Bros. She stated, "Perhaps the games to steal the show were" Space Harrier along with Shrike Avenger (1986), praising their hydraulic cockpit cabinets that "twist, turn and move" in the same direction as the joystick, making them "the most realistic" simulators "to date". She praised Space Harrier's "excellent graphics" for being "all in 3D with amazing technicolour landscapes" and a "multitude of objects" on screen, as well as "the sounds of the battle" output by "large speakers" where "you could almost lose touch with reality". She also praised the gameplay for being "exciting" and "very fast" paced, as well as the continue feature, but stated the game can be "very difficult."Clare Edgeley gave the arcade game a retrospective review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where she noted it had one of the first hydraulic arcade cabinets she had seen, along with 1986's Shrike Avenger. She stated that Space Harrier's "fabulously colourful 3D graphics" and "the movement of the sit-in cabinet were, and still are, breathtaking", noting "the seat-belt" and "turbulent" ride which "hurls you up, down, left and right" and tilts "the cabinet in a roll in whatever direction you push your joystick", concluding the game to be "great fun."Home conversionsReview scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games70% (C64)68% (ZX)40% (CPC)[3]CRASH77% (ZX)Famitsu34/40 (3DS)Sinclair User (ZX)Your Sinclair9/10 (ZX)The Milwaukee Journal9/10 (SMS)AwardsEntityAwardGolden Joystick AwardsGame of the Year (Runner&#8209;Up)The home conversions were also well received. The game was runner-up in the category of Game of the Year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards.The Milwaukee Journal in May 1987 gave the Master System version a positive review, rating it a score of 9 out of 10. The reviewer Edward J. Semrad described the Master System version of Space Harrier as "the latest innovation" and "the most powerful cartridge ever made for any computer or game system." He concluded it "sets new standards in audio, graphic detail, memory and price ($40 list)."The September 1988 issue of Computer Gaming World (page 50) called Space Harrier "the best arcade shoot-'em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played".[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The flying furry creature in the bonus stages is very similar to Falkor, the flying dog-dragon from the 1984 film, The NeverEnding Story.

As well as including an "original mode", which plays identically to the original Arcade version and includes a hidden setting that plays the game in black and white monochrome, Fukkatsu no Hi also includes a "Space Invaders Plus" mode which includes more contemporary 16-bit graphics and power-ups earned from destroying UFOs. The player's ship can also take several hits before being destroyed, but generally has less cover to hide behind.[CR]Taito developed Fukkatsu no Hi to be the first console-exclusive version of the game: previous Space Invaders sequels, remakes and spin-offs had all been Arcade games originally and ported to consoles later. It was released a few months before the Mega Drive/Genesis exclusive version of Space Invaders '90 (Space Invaders '91 in the US). Fukkatsu no Hi did not see a release outside of Japan. It also has zero connection with the 1980 Japanese sci-fi movie Fukkatsu no Hi, a.k.a.

Rick utilizes the awesome power of the ancient Mayan Terror Mask ("Hell Mask" in some versions of the game) and a few random boards, knives, chainsaws, etc. to destroy legions of hell-born foes. Upon finding Jennifer, she turns into a monster whom Rick is forced to kill. Rick eventually escapes the burning West Mansion but not before defeating the soul of its previous resident. In the final moments of the game the player is shown that perhaps the horror isn't over yet...[CR]This was the video game to come with a parental advisory warning. Namco licensed the game to Atari Games for distribution in North America, but the game proved to be controversial there due to its excessive violence and gore as well as references to Christian symbols such as the cross. As a result, the game was eventually banned in the United States after Atari had distributed a hundred arcade cabinets there. Nevertheless, the TurboGrafx-16 port was released in the US, but was heavily toned down compared to the arcade original.[CR]Versions[CR]The 1992 FM Towns port is the only home version which is a perfect conversion of the original arcade game (not including the inclusion with the 360/PS3 Splatterhouse).The TurboGrafx-16 version is heavily censored and edited for violence and gore. However most of the gore removal could be said to be the result of the graphical limitations rather than censoring.The TurboGrafx-16 version has a warning label on the bottom left that states "The horrifying theme of this game may be inappropriate for young children...and cowards."The most obvious graphical edit in the TurboGrafx version is Rick's mask being changed from white to red in order to make him look less like Jason Voorhees.Also in the TurboGrafx port, the inverted- cross boss is changed into another evil mask.An iPhone port was released on 18 November 2010. It has Arcade Mode and Splatter Rush Mode, where you fight hordes of enemies non-stop in under two minutes.

Bison) playable.[CR]In the early '90s, the game received main ports for three platforms: the TurboGrafx-16 (released by NEC Interchannel on June 12, 1993, originally exclusive to Japan), the Genesis (released on September 27, 1993) and the Sharp X68000 (released November 26, 1993, exclusive to Japan). The Genesis version (released as Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition in North America and Europe and as Street Fighter II' Plus: Champion Edition in Japan) is unique, as it also includes some of the updated content from the SNES version of Street Fighter II Turbo (which also has a Champion Edition mode). The TurboGrafx-16 version was digitally re-released worldwide for the Wii Virtual Console on November 16, 2009 (the Japanese version released by Hudson). An obscure port of the game was released for the Sega Master System by Tec Toy in 1997 (for Brazil only).[CR]The game was also ported to the PlayStation in a compilation including World Warrior and Hyper Fighting, released in October 31, 1998 (in North America as Street Fighter Collection 2), December 3, 1998 (in Japan as Capcom Generations 5), and May 1999 (in Europe, published by Virgin, same name as NA). This port includes a Versus and Training Mode, optional arranged soundtracks, and a "Super Vs.

The two versions have a few significant differences, but both has Baloo tasked with exploring environments in and around his hometown of Cape Suzette for valuable items in order to save his and Rebecca Cunningham's air courier service Higher for Hire.[CR]The game should not be confused with Capcom's Disney's TaleSpin for NES and Game Boy, which is a shoot 'em up that uses the same Disney property.Version Differences[CR]The 1991 TurboGrafx-16 version has Baloo chase after pieces of a stone map to find some fabulous treasure, though Higher for Hire's chief rival Shere Khan and his hired air pirate goons led by Don Karnage are also searching for the pieces. In each of the four stages, the player is also optionally tasked with collecting ten specific items to obtain a bonus to their score. Between stages, Baloo's prot&#233;g&#233; Kit Cloudkicker can collect additional bonuses while "sky surfing" behind Baloo's plane, the Seaduck.[CR]The 1992 Genesis version has Baloo competing with Shere Khan to deliver cargo, and is instead tasked with exploring each region for ten cargo crates before he can exit to the next stage.

The player is a farmer with a staff weapon who makes his way across a land filled with odd creatures and goofy-looking warriors. He is encouraged by a facsimile of the game's artistic lead, manga artist Akira Miyashita, and can learn new spells as the game continues. These spells can greatly help in defeating tougher enemies and preserving the player character's health.[CR]When the player reaches the boss, the character switches from a farmer boy in a straw hat to a burly shirtless dude, and the game at this point becomes closer to a brawler. All boss fights are fought in this form, after which the player moves onto the next world as the straw hat boy again.[CR]The game is exclusive to Japan. It is probably best known to the West via its appearance on the TV show GameCenter CX.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>20/10/1989</releasedate>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Advance Communication Company</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>wvPuqg3qz-w</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/588951-tatsu-no-ko-fighter</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tatsu-no-ko-fighter/3030-48356/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707736-tatsunokofighter_pce.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707750-tatsunokofighter002.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707749-tatsunokofighter001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707748-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-012.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707747-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-011.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707746-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-010.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707744-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-008.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707741-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-005.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707740-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-004.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707739-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-003.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2707738-tatsu+no+ko+fighter+%28j%29-002.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ten no Koe Bank (Japan)">		<description>Ten no Koe Bank (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FTen%20no%20Koe%20Bank%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="74298" />		<title_clean>Ten no Koe Bank</title_clean>	</game>	<game name="Tenseiryuu - Saint Dragon (Japan)">		<description>Tenseiryuu - Saint Dragon (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FTenseiryuu%20-%20Saint%20Dragon%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="164162" />		<title_clean>Tenseiryuu - Saint Dragon</title_clean>		<plot>Shoot 'em up where you play as a robotic dragon with the ability to use your tail to deflect bullets and harm enemies.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]This is by far the worst TG-16 game I have ever seen.

In this game you take control of a helicopter and destroy air and ground threats while avoiding buildings. It is one of the early games to make use of Sega's Super Scaler technology (along with Space Harrier, Hang-On, OutRun, and After Burner), which scaled sprites and allowed them to seem as if they were different distances away from the player, giving the game a pseudo-3D perspective. In the case of Thunder Blade, this made buildings to appear to have height and depth to them, as well as making it seem enemies were coming into view from below as the helicopter flies through the streets.[CR]The game intermittently switches from a vertical scrolling top-down perspective to that of a third-person "behind the helicopter" view in which it appears to travel forwards into the screen, on a Z-axis. Both viewpoints play the same: The player must use a mix of weaponry to attack both rival helicopters in the air and enemy tanks on the ground, all the while avoiding the nearby buildings.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]The original arcade version was released for the Sega X Board hardware. The game came in two different cabinets. The standard upright cabinet featured, like Space Harrier and After Burner, an analog flight stick and force feedback.[CR]The other, more expensive, cabinet was the deluxe sit-down cabinet, where the player sits on a helicopter seat and the seat moves in sync with the chopper's movements, with the player controlling the motion of the seat. The monitor of the deluxe cabinet is decorated with various dials and graphics to simulate the look of a real helicopter cockpit.[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was a huge arcade hit and Sega would port the game to many consoles, including both of their own consoles, Master System and Mega Drive / Genesis, as well as many other systems. These versions generally weren't able to properly mimic the effects of the Super Scaler technology, however.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Color Test Mode[CR]Hold Select + Run and reset the game.

The Arcade version was later added to Capcom's Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 compilation for PS2.[CR]Tiger Road is a Chinese martial arts-inspired brawler that often switches venues to flying stages and other non-traditional action levels, somewhat similar to Battletoads. The protagonist can find new weapons by destroying objects and will switch to them once they are collected, like Ghosts 'n Goblins's Sir Arthur, and the goal of each stage is to find the exit.

Unlike most pinball games with extended play zones, these tables are to the left and right of the core table, and the pinball can switch between them by passing through connecting tunnels. In addition, the player can power up time machines by hitting several levers with the pinball. Entering a time machine takes the pinball to a number of different time zones, each providing a possible score boost or extra ball.[CR]Time Cruise was released exclusively on the TurboGrafx-16, putting it up against Compile's Crush series. Its name in Japan is "Time Cruise II".[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the TG-CD version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,6,5 adding, "...I really like the huge play field. This side-wise scrolling was a rare treat that I hadn't seen before.

Don't you just love 'em? Classics like Tetris, Puzzle Bobble, Klax....and then there's Blodia. The concept behind Blodia is very simple: 1-You have a screen of pipe-work. 2-There is a ball travelling down the pipe. 3-If the ball drops down a gap in the pipe you have to start again. That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]It's hard for me to write an impartial review for Blodia, as this type of puzzle game drives me insane. It is frustrating beyond belief and I would probably damage something if I had to play it for a long period of time. Technically it's fine. Graphics are not great, but there's not much scope for eye candy here, and the music is surprisingly calm and easy to listen to.[CR]This is the kind of game where you have to think and plan ahead very fast - sort of like playing chess with a five second time limit to each move. If you are the kind of person who enjoys this sort of thing, then you will probably like Blodia. But if you are like me then you will hate it with a passion and should avoid it like the plague. Tetris I can handle. Blodia I can't.[CR]http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Blodia.htm[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level cheats[CR]At the title screen, choose password and enter the following:</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Turbo Technologies</studio>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>8239</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/tg16/589140-timeball</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/timeball/3030-34440/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8239-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/1/0/311210_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716734-blodia_%28timeball%29_%28j%29-001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716733-timeball001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716731-timeball_%28u%29-003.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716730-timeball_%28u%29-002.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716729-timeball_%28u%29-001.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/6/3/gfs_88029_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/f/e/gfs_88029_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/4/a/gfs_88029_3_1.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Titan (Japan)">		<description>Titan (Japan)</description>		<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016.zip/NEC%20-%20PC%20Engine%20-%20TurboGrafx%2016%2FTitan%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="72106" />		<title_clean>Titan</title_clean>		<plot>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.[CR]For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.[CR]The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key  a very useful option in tricky situations.[CR]Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, Right.

Think I'm kidding? I shit you not! More screenshots after the jump: The game starts in a dimly lit bathroom. There's a little kid standing there very still, and suddenly, the little fucker flashes you for like 30 minutes, cock in your face, as he contemplates life and the gigantic shit he's about to take. Maybe he's not a flasher, he's just half asleep. He looks pretty tired. Poor little guy.[CR]Ok, go on. Get your #2 done already. But in the middle of his bowel movement, he gets on the john and is inexplicably warped into Turdworld. Why him? Why that night? Nobody knows. He was chosen. It's like walking into a bathroom at a gas station. Sometimes you're in and out. And sometimes the word FLOWER spelled on the wall in diarreah and it's a lifelong experience you never forget. These things happen. It's the circle of pooh. Or maybe he took the biggest, most awesome magical shit ever and he was summoned by this weird buddha of the feces kingdom guy to challenge his poopy prowess in the ultimate turd warfare!!! [CR]You're straddled to some flying thing (toilet?) and fly around a vertically scrolling world very much like 1942 rendered in marginal, cutesy 16 bit graphics. Observe thy foes: A flying penis squadron, frogs with gigantic vaginas who pee on you, gnats throwing poo nuggets, and so on. You have a forward attack button and a bomb button to hit the enemies below. They even have monkeys flying shit out of their asses - no detail was missed. Do you see the gigantic asses on these spiders? They mean business. The game is actually fun to play, has a pleasant generic soundtrack, and is HARD! I've never been able to finish the final dump.[CR]COMMENT:[CR]So where can you get this game? Ebay typically has it for $50-$100. If you poke around on Google you may get lucky and find a rom.

The player, as the bio-mechanical mutant warrior The Turrican, must make their way across a semi-non-linear world and defeat a boss before they can move onto the next world. The Turrican can change its weapon type, but any weapon besides the default will require finite ammo which must be found in the environment first.[CR]Turrican was originally developed for the Commodore 64 by a single programmer/designer, Manfred Trenz, but the Amiga and Genesis conversions are the best known versions. This is due in part to the music composed by Chris Huelsbeck for those versions. Turrican also saw releases for the Game Boy and TurboGrafx-16. Super Turrican (NES) is a composite game partly based on stages in the original Turrican and its sequel Turrican 2. Numerous homebrew attempts have been made to reboot Turrican for the modern era.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story (like found in the home computer manuals) is fast told: A long time ago the three-headed creature called Morgul was banished by the hero Devolon to an unknown dimension. The reason for this feat was that Morgul tormented the mankind with fears and nightmares. After Morgul's banishment fear and sleepless nights disappeared out of peoples lives. But since lately the people suffer again from a serious state of dread and fear and the nightmares come back. The apprehension is great that Morgul has returned to his kingdom. So armed with the latest weapons and technical equipment the player has to find and destroy Morgul in his kingdom.[CR]An alternate story is given in the Genesis/TurboGrafx-16 versions: Here is Morgul (Multiple-Organism-Unit-Link) a powerfull ecosystem generation network which the early colonists used to render the world of Alterra inhabitable. After a cataclysmic quake all system interface functions were severed and Morgul rebelled. He twisted all lifeforms of Alterra to his brutal, destructive purposes. To recapture Alterra genetic scientists created Turrican, a bio-engineered mutant warrior.

It has a good sense of humor, relatively simple controls and reasonable graphics. It has a pretty good amount of options in the way of team variety, and different lines. The writers did not go to the trouble of buying professional rights or anything, so they just banked on good old nationalism to stir up rivalries. [CR]There are about ten teams each with three lines which you can switch between during a game. The lines are composed of homogeneous players with identical stats in a line. Granted, this shows something of a lack of sophistication, but when you switch between control of different players in a line it is comforting. The game allows options of a tournament or individual games, given that the games last as long as a real hockey game (three 20 minute periods) I doubt anyone will play many tournaments.[CR]Up to 5 players can play, on separate sides or on the same side. This is one feature that I have found to be quite entertaining, since it can be more fun (and less aggravating) to cooperate with a friend than compete. This also allows a group of friends to staff a full line, which I have yet to try due to a lack of controllers.[CR]The other big plus to the game is the way in which it simulates fighting and penalties. If you check someone real hard, you go to a fight screen in which the two players slug it out, and whoever gets decked gets the penalty. Also the probability of fights breaking out is determined by which set of rules is chosen. All in all it is a pretty good hockey game, not stellar, but a worthwhile purchase for $25 or under.[CR]REVIEWER: James Stepanek.[CR]http://baetzler.de/vidgames/Hu-reviews.var[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Canadian Championships[CR]From the main menu, choose "Password".

Check her out. The graphics are better than a lot of what you'll see on supposedly superior systems like the SNES, and the music is pretty rockin' too. The control is spot on, other than the inaccurate jumping.[CR]Here's a quick break down of what's gonna happen in every level: Begin level, battle off onslaught of cheap enemies (level 2 especially bothers me. Even though your chest cannon (hold I+II) is devastatingly weak, you have to use it against these guys, and they all die from it before getting a shot off. Boring!), go through the middle of the level, probably dodging some lasers and/or missiles, reach boss, blast him a new one, finish level and go to Veigues Command Center, where you can use your points gained (based off a formula of enemies killed and remaining shields) to upgrade your mech in a variety of ways. Go again.[CR]On the one hand you could argue that this is a boring archetypal action game, but on the other hand, no game is quite like this, though the closest would probably be Atomic Robo Kid.

While there are other competitors on the road, the goal is to simply keep the timer going until the finish line is reached.[CR]To add a simulation element, the player must select a bunch of replacement parts before starting a race. Intermittently, the player will need to substitute in new parts as the old ones get damaged either from regular wear and tear or from player error, such as incorrectly switching gears or driving over potholes.[CR]Though not explicitly stated, the race is based on the famous Paris-Dakar Rally. This inference can be made as Paris can be clearly seen in the background for the early stages of the race (though less obvious is why the player is heading towards it) and the later, more difficult stages are set in desert environments.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1987</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

The goal is to pass through six stages, fighting off waves of enemies from both directions and defeating the boss at the end of each one, and eventually rescue the main character's kidnapped girlfriend. Kung-Fu Master also had the hero chase down a kidnapped damsel in distress, as would two other very prolific arcade brawlers at the time: Double Dragon and Final Fight.[CR]Vigilante originally came out in the Arcades in 1988. It was closely followed by two console conversions: a Sega Master System port that made several concessions to the game for the sake of space, including changing some of the names, and a more faithful Turbografx-16 version in 1989. US Gold also published a version for several western home computers, while Korean company Clover handled the MSX home computer version. The Turbografx-16 version was also later rereleased on Nintendo's Wii Shop in all territories.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.)

As well as ports for the PC Engine, Genesis and the home computers Atari ST, Amiga and PC, Volfied was also released on the 2005 PS2 compilation Taito Legends and as a Java mobile game in Europe in 2007.[CR]On home consoles in North America, it was marketed under the more familiar QIX brand. It was known as The Jintori ~Volfied 1500 (Japan) and Neo QIX (US) for its PlayStation port, which was part of the Simple budget series. For its North American Sega Genesis release, it was known as Ultimate QIX.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with QIX, the goal is to carve out pieces of the playing field by drawing a box that encapsulates a certain percentage of the screen. While drawing these boxes, the player's vehicle is vulnerable to the various enemy craft patrolling the playing field. Areas within the drawn squares turn inert and are inaccessible by enemies. Once the player turns enough of the playing field inert, which is a minimum of 80% for Volfied (up from the 70% needed for QIX), the level is complete and the player earns a bonus based on how far over the minimum percentage amount they managed to achieve. Each screen has one large enemy that cannot be defeated: if the player cuts the field in half with one maneuver, the "active" playing field will be whichever side holds the large enemy. Smaller enemies, however, will be destroyed if they are inside the inert area.[CR]Volfied introduces small bonus pods that, once enveloped in a box, confer bonuses and power-ups to the player. The type of power-up they earn is based on the letter on the power-up.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Continue[CR]After getting a game over, press Start at the title screen and when the opening demo is begins, press Left 4 times.

The game is actually a tokusatsu "hero show", I.E. a stage show with people in costume acting as heroes and villains; such tokusatsu shows were once a popular form of entertainment for children in Japan and generally would feature well-known heroes and villains, such as characters from Kamen Rider. However, based on the appearance of the audience, the "Wonder Momo" show seems to be aimed at a slightly different audience. It is being presented at "Namco Theater". [CR]In the game's storyline, Momo is a heroine from space who is fighting the evil "Phantom Warudemon Army" (Kaijin Gundan Warudemon" / &#24618;&#20154;&#36557;&#22243;&#12527;&#12523;&#12487;&#12514;&#12531;). [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A screen cap from the PC Engine version. [CR]The player controls Momo with a traditional 8 way joystick or D-pad, in the case of the home ports. Momo can jump and attack with the respective buttons; she can also high jump by holding up and jump and has several attacks at her disposal. Each stage consists of a backdrop against which Momo will fight a variety of enemies; If the player wanders far enough to either the left of right, they will encounter a curtain. After enough enemies are defeated a boss will appear. A whirlwind will also appear at various points; if Momo makes contact with the tornado, she will turn in to Wonder Momo![CR] AttacksKick: A standing kick.Crouching Kick: No explanation necessary.Jumping Kick: A kick... in the air!Two-way Kick: This can only be performed if Momo is crouching or jumping; in addition, she must be facing towards the screen, not left or right.Wonder Kick: Jump forward and attack. A powerful jumping kick.Wonder Ring: As Wonder Momo, Momo comes equipped with a hoop technically termed the "wonder ring". She will throw the hoop instead of kick if the attack button is pressed. The hoop will then bounce around until it is caught; then Momo can throw it again, etc. [CR]There are two bars at the top of the screen, Momo's vitality bar and a "wonder" bar. The vitality bar is (obviously) the amount of damage Momo can take from enemies before the player loses a life. The wonder bar is filled slowly by defeating enemies as regular Momo. When Momo becomes Wonder Momo, the wonder bar depletes at a very slow rate. Should the player miss the whirlwind Momo can also turn in to Wonder Momo at any time by facing forward and rapidly pressing the attack button so long as the player has some wonder meter! ItemsA green and yellow capsule. [CR]There are a few types of items that can be dropped by enemies. Red and yellow capsule: This restores some of Momo's vitality. Green and yellow capsule: This will only appear when Momo is "Wonder Momo". When picked up, Wonder Momo will perform the "Wonder Typhoon", where she becomes invincible, spins in place, and shoots projectiles rapidly to both her left and right. This item is a blue and yellow capsule in the Arcade version.White and red capsule: Allows Momo to fire "specium beam" type projectiles, a reference to Ultraman, for a period of time. Her version is called the "wonder shot". [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] [CR]Wonder Momo [CR] Enemy Characters[CR]These are just some of the enemies Momo will encounter. Some enemies are exclusive to the Arcade version.  A modoki.[CR] Modoki: The basic grey goons who pop out of the floor and advance slowly towards Momo. Sometimes they get distracted by the audience.[CR]Kurukodaruma: Tiny ninjas wearing jet-packs. They throw shuriken, and sometimes attack in a "totem-pole" formation. [CR]Crystal tower: Spikes of crystal that pop out of the ground and scatter projectiles. [CR]Cyclone: Pink UFOs that float overhead and sometimes shoot at Momo.[CR]Crab Fencer: A crab-clawed fellow with long attack reach. He exclaims "Kani kani! (crab crab!)" whenever he's about to attack in the Arcade version.Shamoan. [CR] Shamoan: A monster who loves to do break-dance style attacks, especially headspins. [CR]Tyran: A cyborg dinosaur who breathes fire. Only found in the Arcade version.[CR]Acro-ball: A robot who likes to somersault around the stage and head-butt Momo.[CR]Jagrock: A sturdy robot who attacks Momo by throwing yellow objects. [CR]Cannonporter: A musclebound monster with a rocket launcher. His rockets make a U-turn after exiting the screen and come back.Amazona. [CR] Amazona: The only woman in the Warudemon Army. She is Momo's self-proclaimed rival. [CR]Mozuu: The mysterious leader of the Warudemon Army.[CR]SPECIAL ENEMY[CR]That annoying kid: A kid in the crowd who periodically wanders by and attempts to take a flash photo of Momo, damaging her and making her stumble. He isn't a part of the show, so Momo can't do anything about him other than avoid the flash.Being a goon is hard work. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Pinup Screens[CR]First do the Level Select code.

It's an unassuming baseball game for a dead, semi-obscure console. And it is grand indeed.[CR]The game does not offer the simulated Major League Baseball Experience. Heck, with teams like the Tokyo Ninjas and the Peking Ducks, it doesn't even pretend to. There are no players who are obviously clones of real major leaguers, or any of those shenanigans. This game delivers intense baseball action in its own little world, and does it well.[CR]If you ask me to name some special feature that this game has that no other baseball game does, I cannot. Rather, the game takes all basic aspects of a decent 16-bit baseball game and does them JUST right. The game has a great 'feel;' I know, it's a vague compliment, but hear me out.[CR]Take the pitching, for example. You get a nice variety of pitcher types, from traditional righties and lefties to the wily sidearmer. Each pitcher type has a different delivery, giving the pitcher/batter interface some delicious variety. And as the ball heads towards the batter, you can tilt its trajectory left or right with the control pad to try to fool the batter. With a little practice, you'll easily be able to put your pitches exactly where you want them, with enough zig-zagging tomfoolery on the way to keep the ball from being slammed into orbit. Of course, if you're not paying attention and your hurler has run out of steam, don't be surprised if the ball doesn't tilt like it used to, and your trick pitch suddenly goes straight down the middle in slow motion for the hungry hitter to feed on.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/turbo16/review/R58128.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Team[CR]At the Vs Mode or Edit Mode team selection screen, hold Select and press I to pick your team.

As with that game, it's a basic tennis simulator that follows the action from a vertical perspective on the court. The player can assert some control over the direction of their shot by holding one of the directional buttons and can switch from a regular volley to overheads and lobs in order to outmaneuver their opponent.[CR]It is notable for its inclusion of an RPG-inspired Quest Mode, along with single and doubles mode options, which begins with a user-generated player (customizable as far as name and gender) receiving a message from "a King of Tennis" to defeat another, eviller King of Tennis. This mode has some basic RPG elements, including buying better equipment and defeating bosses to advance the plot, but all the "battles" play out as regular tennis matches, ranging from a single game to a whole set. Winning random match encounters awards some cash, while losing them simply drops the player off at the starting town, which happens to be Chicago.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheats[CR]At the Quest Mode password screen, enter the following Japanese characters (format is Row #, Column #): - 7,8 (Space) - 6,9 -.
