		<emu_comment>The Philips CD-i (Compact Disc Interactive) is an interactive multimedia CD player developed and marketed by Royal Philips Electronics.[CR]This category of device was created to provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but at a lower price than a personal computer with CD-ROM drive at the time. The cost savings were due to the lack of a hard drive, floppy drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor (a standard television was used), and less operating system software. In addition to games, educational and multimedia reference titles were produced, such as interactive encyclopedias, museum tours, etc. before public Internet access was widespread. Competitors included the Tandy VIS and Commodore CDTV. CD-i also refers to the multimedia Compact Disc standard used by the CD-i console, also known as Green Book, which was developed by Philips and Sony. Work on the CD-i began in 1984 and it was first publicly announced in 1986.[CR]Manufacturer: Philips[CR]CPU: Philips SCC68070[CR]Memory: 1 MB of main RAM[CR]Graphics: SCC66470, later MCD 212[CR]Sound: MCD 221 16-bit stereo sound[CR]Display: 384x280 to 768x560[CR]Media: Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  1</emu_comment>

You can acquire some interesting gadgets from the druid-spy Dubbelosix, that will help you move more quickly. To win the recquired souvenir items, you have to either answer the questions asked in the country squares or buy them from the Phoenician merchant Ekonomikrisis with sestertii won in challenge squares. The scoundrel Tortuous Convolvulus will also try to impede the players progress, so look out.</plot>

		<plot>Axis and Allies is a 1998 turn-based strategy video game closely based on the Axis and Allies: Classic board game.[CR]Players take control of one of five world powers at the start of 1942 in WW2, grouped into the opposing factions of the Allies (US, UK, and USSR) and the Axis (Germany and Japan). Victory conditions are set at the start of the game: complete world domination, the capture of enemy capitals, or reaching a set level of economic power by the Axis.[CR]The game is turn-based, with the USSR turn first, and the USA turn last. Each power's turn of the game is broken into several phases. First is the research phase, where IPCs (a representation of industrial power) can be gambled in an attempt to develop advanced technology, such as jet engines or rockets. The remaining IPCs are then used to buy troops in the purchase phase. Troops are then moved in the combat move phase, and battles resolved in the combat phase. Non-combative moves are then performed in the non-combat move phase, new units are then placed at the powers' factories and IPCs for all territories the power now controls are collected in the place units/collect income phase and the powers' turn ends.[CR]A second edition of the game was released in 1999 titled Axis and Allies: Iron Blitz. It added a function to allow the third edition rules of the game as well as new features such as allowing a submarine to submerge instead of withdrawal and having multiple AA guns occupy the same territory. In addition, it included many alternate scenarios, providing for events that ranged from a Western Allied-Soviet war after World War II (Allies: UK/US vs Axis: Soviet Union/(Communist) Germany), to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact being made into a formal alliance, which turns Japan into the Allies (Allies: UK/US/Japan vs Soviet-German Axis.) And, of course, there is the default scenario from the board game (Allies: UK/US/Soviet vs Germany/Japan.)</plot>

The game's star, Sol Cutter, is a computer hacker and small-time data thief whose latest steal at the beginning of the game comes with a nasty sting.

The player must guide Sol out of Softech and into the Televerse in order to find his cure. Various obstacles and games stand in his way, and there is the overarching realisation that Burn Cycle has been planted by someone with malicious intent.</plot>

		<plot>Christmas Crisis is a 2D plaftorm game with a Christmas theme. The player plays as Santa Claus and has to disarm twenty-four presents that have been rigged with explosives by the malicious Dr. Rubberchicken. As Santa the player is armed with snowballs which can be used to knock out evil toys sent to stop you in your path by Dr. Rubberchicken.[CR]Aside from snow, which allows the player to replenish his snow balls there's various other types of pickups that can be collected such as treasure. When enough treasure is collected the player receives a password that allows him to restart the game from that level after he has died.[CR]The game features new themes for each level and in the end the player has to fight a final boss. Most levels are vertically orientated and thus allow for lots of jumping. In between levels there's some 3D bonus levels in which the player rides Santa's sleigh in first person perspective. The sleigh moves along a rail and the player has to dodge obstacles.</plot>

		<plot>Clue is a full-motion video adaptation of the popular board game of the same name. There are three storylines with four difficulty levels, each with a unique solution making it altogether twelve different mysteries: The Hodded Madonna, Happy Ever After and Deadly Patent.[CR]The movement system, where the player moves the cursor to a portion of the screen and clicks on it to move or turn to that direction is similar to the one found in the The 7th Guest. Inside the rooms the screen switches to a 360º panorama that can be scrolled by moving the cursor to its edges. Clicking on clocks starts a flashback video of what happened on the room before the crime was committed. Clicking on suspects brings up the interrogation screen, where they can be inquired about weapons, their alibis, etc. Clicking on secret passages transports the player to another room. Clicking on the bell calls the butler and the accusation menu, where the player chooses the weapon and the murderer. Afterwards, the butler informs if the player made the right choice. A notebook keeps track of all the information collected, and can be accessed at any time.[CR]Each of the four difficulty levels have a different number of accusations available (3 on the easiest level, 1 on the hardest one). In the easier levels the room positions are fixed, while in the tougher levels they are random.[CR]In each player's turn they can perform two moves, two actions or a action and a move. A move is defined by entering and leaving a room. A action is defined by examining items, interrogating suspects or watching a flashback.</plot>

		<plot>In 2123, the UNS Amazon is sent as part of an exploration fleet to various planets to determine new viable locations for settlement as the Earth is destroyed by human activity. En route to Saturn, the Amazon is ensnared by a massive alien being resembling a large asteroid. The protagonist, Commander Jason Barr, is sent to investigate the incident.[CR]He encounters heavy resistance on his way to Saturn, and after fighting through multitudes of alien ships, encounters the UNS Amazon almost completely absorbed by the organic asteroid. As he explores it, he comes into contact with what appears to be Captain Sumoki of the Amazon. However, she morphs into a demonic looking alien and attacks. Upon defeat, it reverts to the appearance of the Captain and Barr takes it back to the Moon base.[CR]The being is examined and determined to be an alien clone. Upon interrogation, it reveals an alien listening base located on Tethys. Barr heads to Tethys to find the base and destroy its communication uplink. Upon his arrival he encounters a probe which proceeds to scan his ship before heading back to the base. Barr chases it through the valleys, where he locates the base. He manages to complete his mission and escape the base before it's destroyed. His ship, however, gets caught in the data beam and he is pulled up through it.[CR]Regaining consciousness, he pilots the ship through several pieces of debris and destroys an awaiting alien ship. His ship is badly damaged in the process and crashes into the alien mothership. With no means of escape, he searches the ship and engages the leader in battle, finally defeating him on the bridge. He then accidentally activates the ship terraforming ability, changing its coordinates from Earth to Mars. With this Mars is transformed into a second Earth, providing humanity a new home.</plot>

		<plot>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.[CR]The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</plot>

		<plot>Jan Pienkowski Haunted House is an adaptation of the pop-up children's book of the same name by Jan Pienkowski. In this game for children of ages 4 to 8 they explore a haunted house that's filled with strange creatures and fun-filled games. There is no real horror to be found, but strange ghosts and monsters from both Earth and beyond do hide out in the house. Each room features original art from the pop-up book and can be explored at will. Clicking on hotspots in the room activates funny animations that will appeal to children. These are accompanied by sometimes ominous music but mostly funny sound effects. Using a map of the house the player can quickly travel to any part of the house. There's no real objectives rather than to have fun and explore.</plot>

However, different from the other games is that there is no computer opponent to play against and Final Jeopardy doesn't have the answering system like the previous rounds.

		<plot>The Joker's Wild Jr. is a trivia game based on the 70-80s game show The Joker's Wild. The game is hosted by Marc Summers.[CR]Gameplay is the same as for the adult version The Joker's Wild. In the game players answer multiple choice questions stated by the host. Categories for the questions are determined by a giant slot machine with three wheels. Each wheel features five categories and a joker. Each round a player pulls the lever and picks one of the resulting categories. The joker counts as a wild card.[CR]When an answer is correctly given to a question the player receives a certain amount of money. If the category is shown on the slot machine two or three times (2 or 3 of a kind) the scores are multiplied. When a player answers incorrectly his opponent may give a shot at the question and steal the money.[CR]Unlike the original show this video game adaptation can be played with up to four players. Of course no money can be won with this video game, but there is a high score list that keeps track of all the best scores. Major differences with the adult version are the change of host, easier questions and some more children friendly graphics.</plot>

		<plot>This is the sequel to Kingdom: The Far Reaches. Many years ago, the wise Mobus broke a powerful amulet called "The Hand" in 5 pieces in order to protect it from getting into the hands of his evil brother Torlock. These pieces were sent to the far corners of the land. As the young Prince Lathan Kandor you have already retrieved the Black Mace, the Hunting Horn and the Orb of Mobus (in the previous game). Now you must retrieve the final 2 pieces (the Dagger of Arne and the Crown of Malric), defeat evil and be reunited with Princess Grace Delight.[CR]This is an adventure from the makers of Dragon's Lair. The plot isn't exactly original or complex, but the animation is fluid and well-drawn. Gameplay is about using the right item or making the correct choice between the animated sequences; some of these choices are timed, meaning that you can lose health or even die, but there are plenty of opportunities to replenish your health. Of special note is the ever-present Disney-like music.</plot>

		<plot>Lingo is a digital version of the TV game show of the same name. Like in the game show it is the objective to guess five letter words. You are only given the first letter. You get several tries and with each try the letters are marked which are correctly placed and those who appear in the word but at a different location. Within words you get to blindly draw a ball from a pool. There are 17 numbered balls that correspond with a numbers on a bingo card. There's a ball with a question mark that let the players pick a number at will. When the players complete a row or column they receive bonus points. There's also three red balls that passes the turn to the other player and three green balls. A green ball allows you to pick another ball and also when you get three green balls before the game is over you win a jackpot. The game starts with two players, but after some rounds the player with most points goes to the finale. The game is in Dutch so only features Dutch words. It contains a library of 15,000 words. There's also options for six and seven letter games. It is officially licensed by the Dutch iteration of the game show and thus includes the Dutch TV presenter François Boulangé.</plot>

If you said Plunderball for the Philips CD-i we’d say that youre in line with our best guess. In all seriousness this game is definately unique to say the least. Imagine a futuristic soap opera with a pinball twist and you get Plunderball. As odd of a game it may be, it does grab you in and becomes addictive very quick. The story begins with the kidnapping of a space princess played bt some hot blonde chick we don’t know and moves on from there as you hit certain objects on the pinball field.</plot>

The end result was the Supervisor Droid, a machine capable of assuming any form and accessing any database. But when an EGO virus infected the Supervisor's self-awareness it started to consider its need above of those of the company, infecting the other robots in the plant and declaring itself their leader. Electrocorp then sent its top-secret ECO32-5 Cyborg to infiltrate the plant and destroy the supervisor.[CR]Rise of the Robots is a versus fighting game.

Parents can select games of an appropriate age level for their children. There are five games to be played, but they are all pretty much similar. In each game a series of questions is asked. The player can click on a picture which represents a scene, person, animal or item from the game to select his or her answer. Some questions are about the content of the game. Others ask for the opinion of the player (for example: "During which part of the story would you have been most frightened if you were the main character?") There's no wrong answer in these cases.[CR]The game is part of the Storybook Adventures series and features the exact same interface as the other titles in the series: a magic bookmark that turns into a wizard as your guide.</plot>

Letters are received one at a time and disappear again after a certain amount of time creating a time pressure for forming words. The player can see what his next letter is going to be so he can plan ahead. The game can be played with up to four players.</plot>
