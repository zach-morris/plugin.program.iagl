		<emu_comment>The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, often called simply 3DO, is a video game console originally produced by Panasonic in 1993. Further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by Sanyo and Goldstar. The consoles were manufactured according to specifications created by The 3DO Company, and were originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technology Group. The system was conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. Despite a highly promoted launch (including being named Time magazine's "1994 Product of the Year") and a host of cutting-edge technologies, the 3DOs high price, limited third-party developer support, and an over-saturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to competitors Sega and Nintendo.[CR]Developer:  The 3DO Company[CR]Manufacturer:  Panasonic[CR]CPU:  32-bit 12.5 MHz RISC CPU (ARM60)[CR]Memory:  2 MB of main RAM[CR]Graphics:  "Clio" Graphics Accelerator[CR]Sound:  16-bit stereo sound[CR]Display:  640x480[CR]Media:  Disc[CR]Max.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Initially released on the PC in 1992, Alone in the Dark is an early example of the sort of horror-themed game that Capcom would later coin as "survival horror" with the Resident Evil series. Alone in the Dark's influence shines through clearly in the early Resident Evil games, as well as other horror-themed releases, such as Silent Hill.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Aside from being the first of its kind, Alone in the Dark was one of the first fully-polygonal games in general. Notable for providing the player with a character that could manipulate objects in the surrounding environment and for providing a wide range of 3D characters and creatures to interact with. As players move from room to room, they're tasked with searching the environment for clues to solve puzzles to proceed to the next area, while simultaneously fending off attacks from creatures.To fight off these attacks, players can wield several types of weapons, from knives, swords, brooms, and bottles to firearms like rifles, pistols, and shotguns. While the guns are supreme in their damage dealt, aiming the weapons in the fixed camera positions of each room can be extremely difficult, and the player must be mindful to conserve ammunition, as extra rounds are extremely rare throughout the course of the game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Emily Hartwood (Left) &amp; Edward Carnby (Right.)Set in 1925, the player takes the role of either Edward Carnby, a private detective, or Emily Hartwood, an antique dealer and niece of a famous artist named Jeremy Hartwood. The player character is called to Jeremy's Louisiana mansion after Jeremy's apparent suicide by hanging. Upon investigation of the local town, the player soon learns that nobody is surprised to hear of Jeremy's death, as the mansion is said to by possessed by a foul and dreadful presence. The game begins with the player's character investigating the attic of the mansion as nightfall sets in, prompting the attack of vicious, Lovecraftian beasts. As the protagonist works down to the cavernous depths under the mansion, he/she uncovers the once-human, now an evil entity named Pregzt as the pervasive, corrupting influence on both the mansion and Jeremy Hartwood's mind. The player emerges victorious by throwing the fiery oil lamp into the abomination. He/she then escapes from the collapsing cavern and outside.[CR]Minimum System Requirements[CR]PCWindows XP / Vista1.8 GHz processor512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)2GB HDDMouseKeyboardMACOS X 10.6.8 or laterIntel Core Duo 2GHz+ processor1GB RAM64MB video memoryTwo-button mouse recommended [CR]Related Links[CR]Postmortem on GDC by Frederick Raynal:http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015840/Classic-Game-Postmortem-Alone-in[CR]</plot>

Three tracks are available - a city at night, a coastal highway, and a forest track. Players race against one CPU opponent, while trying to hit checkpoints in the quickest time possible. Both automatic and manual transmissions are available for each car. Cars cannot be tuned, and there is no two-player option. Despite being released only in Japan, all menus and game text is in English.</plot>

Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.[CR]Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. [CR]Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</plot>

			<title_clean>Captain Quazar</title_clean>
			<plot>Captain Quazar was an isometric shooter in the same vein as arcade titles, such as Smash TV. Gameplay consisted of the player mowing down numerous waves of assorted enemies. The character portrays the brave, yet somewhat dense, Captain Quazar as he attempts to save the planet from an alien scourge. The game relied heavily on a rather funny intro and humorous cutscenes to balance out the, in the opinion of many, rather difficult game play. [CR]</plot>

			<plot>StoryThe game begins with the main hero - a soldier landing on a strange island. His parachute gets stuck on a tree. While trying to get down he is attacked and bitten by a zombie. The hero is then rescued by Rastafarian that becomes your guide on the island. Using transceiver he finds that his comrades were captured and massacred by a crazy scientist creating a zombie-solider arny. the original mission was to stop him but the goal quickly turns to that of survival. The hero is slowly turning into zombie and the only way of survival is finding an antidote.GameplayUnlike much of Digital Pictures's lineup the movie and the gameplay are not synonymous. Rather there are clear "gameplay" sections as well as video segments. The "gameplay" portion of the game consists of a scrolling scene where players must shoot zombies before they reach them.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]PS Front Cover (Japan)D is among the first games developed by WARP Inc and its late founder Kenji Eno, after some more standard video games. The game was actually titled D's Dinner Table ("D no Shokutaku"), but was released in English regions simply as "D".Not only was D one of the company's first games, it was also the company's first game to be in the "interactive fiction" style that the company came to be known for. D was initially developed on only three Amiga computers. Most media and game players at the time considered the 3D visuals used in the game to be a miraculous feat, especially considering the small number of developers and computers used to create the game in its entirety.D was a breakthrough title for Warp, pushing the boundaries of video games, with first-person survival horror, FMV pre-rendered movement, puzzle-solving gameplay, a disturbing atmosphere, and taboo content such as violence and cannibalism.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]D is basically an adventure game in which the player controlled main character Laura Harris, who must find out why her father has gone on a murderous rampage and is holding hostages in a hospital. The game uses pre-generated computer graphics and full motion video to tell its story. The player has two hours to solve the mystery of why Laura's father went on his bloody massacre. The player manipulates the Laura character from both a first person and third person perspectives.The game has several endings, a time's up ending, a good and bad ending, and a 100% completion ending. The ending a player witnessed was based on their actions throughout the game. The 100% complete ending includes the good ending and the addition of the sounds of a newborn baby crying. Some players inexplicably concluded that this sound of a baby crying meant that the visibly not pregnant Laura gave birth at the end of the game, a storyline development that some misguidedly believed would lead directly into the sequel, D2.The 3DO ConsoleD was originally released on the 3DO console and was later ported to the Playstation, Sega Saturn and PC by Acclaim. The game had a very high sell through rate on all those consoles except for the Playstation. The game was considered a sensational hit in Japan.It is rumored that the Playstation game received the most pre-orders, but Sony failed to produce enough copies of the game to meet the demand. Eno decided to sever all further ties with Sony for further WARP developed games. Eno said in an interview with 1UP.com in 2008 "So the sales people had gotten 100,000 preorders from retailers, but Sony wasn't able to manufacture all of them. I was very pissed about that, because one title like that for a small company is very important. If that game doesn't sell well, then that's very bad for the company."[CR]Sequel[CR]A rare glimpse of the original version of D2Main Article: D2The sequel to D, D2, was originally designed as a direct followup to D. Not only that, it would also be among the first games developed for the M2, 3DO's video game platform designed to follow up on the original 3DO and to be manufactured by Panasonic.Because the M2 was cancelled by Panasonic and never came to fruition, the original design for D2 was also cancelled. The original M2 design of the game had it set years after D, and begin as Laura Harris's unborn child is stolen from her by otherworldly power. The child is then miraculously aged and transported back in time to a medieval castle that the player, as the child, must escape from. Some believe that this game as originally intended was more directly related to the first game, it being related to the sounds of the newborn baby that were featured in one of the endings of the first game. The concept was dropped in the process of the game's redesign.[CR]</plot>

Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.[CR]D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</plot>

			<plot>The interstellar war is over leaving you, a casualty, as a disembodied brain inside a life support system. Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. So that sets the scene and the scope of the game, it's an 'explore alien ship' adventure game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of a lot of video sequences in which you talk to your colleagues, animated exploration sequences, and, static door opening and 'how do these alien controls work' type puzzles. There is also a maze and a bit of shooting, a timed sequence or two, most of the usual culprits. There's no inventory to speak of because being a brain in a box you have no pockets.[CR]All the action takes place in an in-game window that's your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that's there to remind you that you're inside a machine. [CR][B]Features:[/B][CR]1. Hard, medium and easy difficulty settings[CR]2. In-game instructions[CR]3. In-game assistance, not cheats or hints, but descriptions of the current goal[CR]4. Extras, including the game trailer and hi-res pics[CR]5. Starring: Tia Carrere as Ari[CR]6. Co-starring Christian Bocher as Zack[CR]Game mechanics:[CR]Loading and saving the game is simple and uncomplicated. There is no limit to the number of save game slots. The game also features some auto save points that you can jump to at any time to replay a section.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Daedalus Encounter is a four CD, full motion video game developed for the 3DO console, PC and Mac. The video sequences are added into pre-rendered 3D backgrounds. It was released in 1995 and garnered moderate reviews. It's the sort of game that quickly becomes frustrating, especially when scenes have to be started all over again if a mistake is made by the player. The fact that it stars Tia Carrere was used as a selling point, as demonstrated by the front cover of the box. The live action scenes were directed by Scott Ewers and filmed in San Francisco at Cinerent Stage A.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The video cut scenes are linked together with various puzzles and limited exploration areas. A great deal of the puzzles involve either opening doors or activating consoles. You are occasionally tasked with saving the lives of your companions, but it is usually far more entertaining to watch them die. The game ends if any of the main characters die, but you can restart the current scene to continue.   [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Ari and Zack are ex-military personnel turned scavengers. You play the role of their comrade Casey, who suffers a serious accident but is brought back as a cyborg with limited capabilities. For most of the game you see through the eyes of a remote probe controlled by Casey (the player) from the ship. Zack and Ari decide to roam the Galaxy hunting for "juicy derelict ships" to plunder, but they soon get into trouble and need Casey's help to escape their predicament.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Tough and disciplined, Ari ( Tia Carrere) used to be a military pilot and commanded the TAS Interceptor Talon in the first interstellar war.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Daedalus Encounter is a four CD, full motion video game developed for the 3DO console, PC and Mac. The video sequences are added into pre-rendered 3D backgrounds. It was released in 1995 and garnered moderate reviews. It's the sort of game that quickly becomes frustrating, especially when scenes have to be started all over again if a mistake is made by the player. The fact that it stars Tia Carrere was used as a selling point, as demonstrated by the front cover of the box. The live action scenes were directed by Scott Ewers and filmed in San Francisco at Cinerent Stage A.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The video cut scenes are linked together with various puzzles and limited exploration areas. A great deal of the puzzles involve either opening doors or activating consoles. You are occasionally tasked with saving the lives of your companions, but it is usually far more entertaining to watch them die. The game ends if any of the main characters die, but you can restart the current scene to continue.   [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Ari and Zack are ex-military personnel turned scavengers. You play the role of their comrade Casey, who suffers a serious accident but is brought back as a cyborg with limited capabilities. For most of the game you see through the eyes of a remote probe controlled by Casey (the player) from the ship. Zack and Ari decide to roam the Galaxy hunting for "juicy derelict ships" to plunder, but they soon get into trouble and need Casey's help to escape their predicament.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Tough and disciplined, Ari ( Tia Carrere) used to be a military pilot and commanded the TAS Interceptor Talon in the first interstellar war. She likes to play things by the rules even though she now no longer works in the military. She finds Zack's "loose cannon" approach irksome at times, but tolerates his behaviour because of his friendship and loyalty.Zack ( Christian Bocher) used to be the Warrant Officer and co-pilot aboard the Talon under Ari's command. He has a relaxed approach to situations, and sometimes wishes Ari would let her hair down and not be so disciplined all the time.Casey used to be the gunner on the Talon and has known Ari and Zack since basic training.

			<title_clean>Doctor Hauzer</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released by Japanese developer Riverhillsoft for the 3DO in 1994, Doctor Hauzer was the first fully 3D survival horror game. Both the player character and the environment were rendered entirely in 3D polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and a cinematic or overhead view. The game also utilized an early example of cel-shaded art for the character graphics. The game was directed by Kenichiro Hayashi.In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacked any enemies, but the main threat was instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also made effective use of sound, including dynamic background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, and ambient sounds such as the player character's echoing footsteps that can change depending on the surface. These elements would later be used more effectively in Resident Evil. The game is considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre, improving significantly on the likes of Sweet Home and Alone in the Dark while paving the way for the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]GameFan: 268/300 (3 reviewers, 89.333% average) (vol. 2, issue 8, p. 31)Defunct Games: B- [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Doom</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doom is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter developed and published by id for the PC (running MS-DOS) on December 10, 1993.As a nameless space marine, players trek through over 24 levels (split up into three episodes), where they liberate space stations from demon infestation in both Phobos and Deimos, only to take on Hell. The game's engine (later known as id Tech 1) is known to pioneer new features to the genre, including non-perpendicular walls, complex rooms (known as "sectors") with varying height differences, multiplayer (both co-operatively and competitively, for up to four players at a time) and the concept of packaging the game's content (levels, sounds, and music) into singular data files (WAD files) for easier modification and distribution, leading to the birth of the modern mod-making community.The lore of the game, set sometime into the future, involves the Union Aerospace Corporation (U.A.C.), a multi-planetary conglomerate that has been utilized by the Earth military to secretly experiment on alien teleportation technology discovered on the moons of Mars. As they try to establish a gateway between the two moons using this technology, the experiment goes awry and the demons of Hell use the portals to invade the two moons. As the last man standing guarding the Hangar of the U.A.C. space station on Phobos, the lone space marine must fight through the onslaught to keep them from attacking Earth.While the original game was a shareware mail-order release, a special edition of the game (known as The Ultimate Doom) was later distributed in retail boxed format. Also released as a free upgrade for those who own the original game, The Ultimate Doom added a new epilogue episode (Thy Flesh Consumed) bridging the game with its sequel, Doom II: Hell on Earth. The original game also spawned multiple sequels and reboots, numerous console ports, a 2005 sci-fi action film, and a wide variety of unofficial source ports and enhancements (thanks to the decision to release the source code with minimal restriction).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Doom, players progress through each level, blasting away enemies while solving puzzles (involving switches, keycards, and skull-shaped key devices), avoiding environmental hazards (such as crushing ceilings, radioactive acid, and burning lava), and collecting weapons, ammo, and other items (including first-aid kits, body armor, suits that protect from radiation, night-vision goggles, computer maps, and supernatural orbs that grant a special bonus to the player). Unlike id's previous first-person shooter, Spear of Destiny, Doom does not include a scoring or lives system. Players who die can retry the level at the cost of resetting their inventory and stats.Episodes and DifficultiesThe game's campaign is split up into three episodes (each with eight normal levels and one secret level):Knee-Deep in the Dead - The only episode playable in the shareware version, the first episode deals with the marine's journey through the base established on Phobos.The Shores of Hell - After defeating the two big bruisers guarding the teleportation gateway, the marine passes through into Deimos. As the invasion continues, the base becomes more distorted with hellish architecture. The second episode deals with the marine's liberation of demons from the Deimos base.Inferno - Eventually, the marine fights a giant anomaly of flesh and metal (known as the Cyberdemon) in the "Tower of Babel", only to find out Deimos has been teleported to the infernal afterlife, and that the tower connects the moon to Hell itself! The third (and final) episode has the marine blindly wreaking havoc in Hell until he can find the mastermind behind the invasion.Players who are starting a new game can start at the beginning of an episode (starting with no armor and a pistol with 50 bullets). Starting from the second episode, players can find two new cell energy weapons (the uncommon Plasma Gun and the rare BFG-9000) and two new common enemies (the Cacodemon and the Lost Soul). Players can pick between five difficulties (known as "skill levels"):I'm too young to die. - Fewer monsters and more items. Double ammo granted on weapon and ammo pickups. Players take half damage.Hey, not too rough. - Fewer monsters and more items.Hurt me plenty. - Normal difficulty.Ultra-Violence. - More monsters and fewer items.Nightmare! - Added in v1.2. Cheat codes are disabled. More monsters and fewer items. Double ammo granted on weapon and ammo pickups. Monsters react and move faster, and respawn shortly after death.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]FistFistDamage: 10 per punch, 200 with Berserk PackOne of two starting weapons. The fist is simple and effective against weaker enemies but when a Berserk Pack power up is activated it boosts the attack power of the fist considerably allowing the Doom marine to tear through and even gib many enemies with ease.From the manual: "Can be used to punch enemies. It will always be with you."ChainsawChainsawDamage: 20 per 'hit'A powerful melee weapon capable of stunning some enemies.From the manual: "Cuts down the baddies like standing timber, but you have to get close."PistolPistolDamage: 10 per bulletThe second starting weapon. The pistol is one of two weapons to utilize bullets as its ammunition.From the manual: "Your standard military-issue weapon. It will stay with you, so don't forget about it if things get tough."ShotgunShotgunDamage: 10 per pellet, 7 pellets per shell, 70 damage maximumThe shotgun is a very effective weapon to use on most enemies the Doom marine will encounter. Its multi-pellet spread is very useful for crowds. The shotgun is the only weapon to use shells as its ammunition.From the manual: "Deliver a heavy punch at close range and a generous pelting from a distance."ChaingunChaingunDamage: 10 per bulletThe chaingun, like the pistol, uses bullets as its source of ammunition. This rapid-firing machine gun can stun some enemies so it is most effective against a single enemy.From the manual: "Direct heavy firepower into your opponent, making him do the chaingun cha-cha."Rocket LauncherRocket LauncherDamage: 200 per rocketThe Rocket Launcher is one of three weapons capable of gibbing enemies. Rockets deliver splash damage very well so they are ideal for dealing with crowds. This weapon is the only one in the game to use rockets as its ammunition.From the manual: "Deliver an explosive rocket that can turn one bad dude inside-out."Plasma RiflePlasma RifleDamage: 20 per cellThe fastest firing weapon in the game, this weapon is very powerful and effective against whatever it is the Doom marine may encounter. The plasma rifle is one of two weapons to utilize cells as its ammunition.From the manual: "Shoot multiple rounds of plasma energy - frying some demon butt!"BFG 9000BFG 9000Damage: 1000 per blast, 40 cells expendedThe BFG 9000 fires a huge plasma ball which moves slowly through the air. Upon impact, the target it hits receives a huge amount of damage and lots of splash damage as well.From the manual: "The prize of the military arsenal. Great for clearing the room of an unwelcome guest. Shoot it and see for yourself."[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Former HumanHealth: 20Total in single player (ultra violence) : 311From the manual: "Once a marine, always a marine-- except in this case. These guys may look like your old buddies, but now they're nothing more than pistol-toting bi-pedal maggots. Waste em!"Former Human SergeantHealth: 30Total in single player (ultra violence) : 426From the manual: "Ditto. Except these guys are meaner and tougher. These walking shotguns will provide you with a few extra holes if you're not careful."ImpHealth: 60Total in single player (ultra violence) : 719From the manual: "You though an imp was a cute little dude in a red suit with a pitchfork. Think again. This Imp heaves balls of fire down your throat and takes several bullets to die. It's time to find a better weapon than a pistol if you're going to face more than one of these mutants."DemonHealth: 140Total in single player (ultra violence) : 389From the manual: "Sorta like shaved gorillas, except with big heads and lots of teeth. They don't kill easy. Get too close and they'll rip your sorry head off."SpectreHealth: 140Total in single player (ultra violence) : 114From the manual: "Great. Just what you needed. An invisible (nearly) monster. Did you expect a walk in the park?"Lost SoulHealth: 100Total in single player (ultra violence) : 242From the manual: "Dumb. Tough. Flies. On Fire. 'Nuff said."CacodemonHealth: 400Total in single player (ultra violence) : 126From the manual: "They float in the air, belch ball lightning, and have one horrendously big mouth. If you get too close to one of these monstrosities, You're Toast."Baron of HellHealth: 1000Total in single player (ultra violence) : 37From the manual: "Tough as a dump truck and nearly as big, these goliaths are the worst thing on two legs since Tyrannosaurus Rex."CyberdemonHealth: 4000Total in single player (ultra violence) : 2From the manual: "Half unfeeling machine, half raging horned devil. This walking nightmare has a rocket launcher for an arm and will definitely reach out and touch you. Make sure you're loaded for bear before you get to this guy."Spiderdemon (Spider Mastermind)Health: 3000Total in single player (ultra violence) : 1From the manual: "Maybe cybernetics wasn't such a great idea after all. Look what the demons have done with it. It somehow seems unfair that you're not the only guy in Hell with a chaingun. Nope, she has a Super-Chaingun don't you just love it?"[CR]Episodes and Maps[CR]Knee-Deep in the Dead (E1)Level NameMap SlotDesignerPar TimeHangerE1M1John Romero0:30Nuclear PlantE1M2John Romero1:15Toxin RefineryE1M3John Romero2:00Command ControlE1M4Tom Hall, John Romero1:30Phobos LabE1M5John Romero2:45Central ProcessingE1M6John Romero3:00Computer StationE1M7John Romero3:00Phobos AnomalyE1M8Sandy Petersen, Tom HallN/AMilitary Base (secret level)E1M9John Romero2:45Sewers (Xbox only secret map)E1M10David Calvin0:00The Shores of Hell (E2)Level NameMap SlotDesignerPar timeDeimos AnomalyE2M1Sandy Petersen, Tom Hall1:30Containment AreaE2M2Tom Hall, Sandy Petersen1:30RefineryE2M3Tom Hall, Sandy Petersen1:30Deimos LabE2M4Tom Hall, Sandy Petersen2:00Command CenterE2M5Sandy Petersen1:30Hall of the DamnedE2M6Sandy Petersen6:00Spawning VatsE2M7Tom Hall, Sandy Petersen4:00Tower of BabelE2M8Sandy PetersenN/AFortress of MysteryE2M9Sandy Petersen2:50Inferno (E3)Level NameMap SlotDesignerPar TimeHell KeepE3M1Sandy Petersen1:30Slough of DespairE3M2Sandy Petersen0:45PandemoniumE3M3Tom Hall, Sandy Petersen1:30House of PainE3M4Sandy Petersen2:30Unholy CathedralE3M5Sandy Petersen1:30Mt.

Each port of the game have their own unique optimizations, limitations, and differences.Sega 32XDeveloped alongside the Jaguar version below, the Sega 32X version of Doom was developed by Sega (with direct involvement from John Carmack) and was released by Sega on November 21, 1994 as a launch title for that system (alongside Star Wars Arcade). It is the first officially released port of the game.Although the game engine is smooth and advanced for the hardware used, it came with an abundance of limitations. Like the Jaguar-based version, much of the levels' textures and structures were heavily optimized, and the game only a subset of levels from the original game (17 levels, none of which are from the third episode) played sequentially. The Cyberdemon, Spider Mastermind, and Spectre enemies are absent, some items were removed, the BFG-9000 weapon is only obtainable through a cheat code, and all enemies have only front-facing sprites (which also eliminates the possibility of monster infighting). Unlike other versions of the game (except the 3DO version below), the game's screen must be bordered. The music quality has also been degraded due to poor use of the Genesis's sound chip. There are no multiplayer modes included.One interesting thing to note is that while the game does not feature game saving, it allows players to start from any level. Levels 16 (the final level) and 17 (the secret level) can only be accessed if the player starts at Level 1 and does not use any cheat codes. Attempting to get to the secret level otherwise would skip to the next level, while attempting to get to the final level otherwise would roll through the credits and show a fake DOS prompt (which stays until the console is reset). Beating the final level gives an extra congratulatory message and "staff roll" of the game's enemies (similar to Doom II: Hell on Earth).Atari JaguarDeveloped alongside the Sega 32X version, the Atari Jaguar version was developed in-house and released on November 28, 1994.Like the Sega 32X version, the game engine is smooth and advanced for the hardware used and much of the levels' textures and structures were heavily optimized. The game uses a larger subset of levels from the original game (22 levels, one of which is a secret level) and two new replacement levels, all of which are played sequentially. Unlike other ports, there is no music during gameplay (It only plays during the title and intermission screens, where the intermission music is replaced by that level's theme). The Cyberdemon, Spider Mastermind, and Spectre enemies are absent, some items were removed, and enemies no longer respawn on the hardest difficulty.Although there is no manual game saving option, the game automatically tracks the last level completed and allows players to start from any completed level in the main menu. The game also features two-player link cable multiplayer (using the JagLink networking device).One interesting thing to note is that the large amount of buttons on the controller's keypad allows players to switch to any weapon without the need to scroll through weapons. An overlay was included that slipped onto the controller to help accommodate this.Unlike most ports released, the source code for this version was released publicly and served as the basis for most of the future ports (including the 3DO, PS1, and GBA versions).Super Nintendo Entertainment SystemThe Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Doom was developed in-secret by Sculptured and published by Williams (after id's approval) on September 1, 1995. It was later published in Japan by Imagineer.The only 16-bit port developed, the SNES version was built on a custom game engine and is one of the few titles to use the Super FX 2 co-processor to help render the game. Due to the hardware limitations of the console, texture and sprite quality were heavily degraded (floors and ceilings had no textures mapped onto them and all enemies only had front-facing sprites). The Spectre enemy is absent, some items were removed, enemies no longer respawn on the hardest difficulty, monster infighting was removed, and particle effects (such as blood and bullet impacts) were removed. Enemies must visually notice the player to become active. The shotgun also fires only one projectile instead of multiple projectiles (similar to shotgun slugs).While the game does not include all levels from the original version (22 total), it is the only early port to retain the episodic format of the original. It does not support game saving at any capacity. One interesting thing to note is that in non-Japanese revisions of the port, the two easiest difficulties were only playable on the first episode and players cannot start on the third episode on the normal difficulty.Unique to this version of the game is the Mode 7 automap, which rotates the map around the player instead of keeping the map in a fixed rotation. This port also supports mouse capability with the SNES Mouse and, exclusive to the home versions, two-player online multiplayer support (Deathmatch mode only) via the XBAND modem.Sony PlayStationBased on the Jaguar version, the Sony PlayStation version of Doom was developed and published by Williams on November 16, 1995.Along with all of the Jaguar version levels, this version adds one level from the original game, five levels from the Ultimate Doom expansion, 23 levels from Doom II: Hell on Earth, and six new levels (for a total of 59 levels). The levels are split into two "episodes" (one for Ultimate Doom and one for Doom II). While the hardest difficulty was removed, the hard difficulty now adds monsters from Doom II into the original levels. In addition, a new harder type of enemy, the Nightmare Spectre, was added.The game's engine is a significant improvement over the Jaguar version, adding colorized lighting, translucent walls/sprites, and animated skies. The audio was also replaced completely, including new sound effects and a darker, more atmospheric ambient soundtrack. The game also supports two-player link cable multiplayer (using the PlayStation Link Cable). While there is no game saving, this version introduces a new password system.This version would later receive a sequel, titled Final Doom, comprised of levels from both Final Doom expansions and the Master Levels for Doom II expansion. While the gameplay and audio remains the same, support was added for mouse capability with the PlayStation Mouse. The sound effects and voice-overs were also re-used for Doom 64 (along with a similar ambient soundtrack from the same musician).3DO Interactive MultiplayerAlso based on the Jaguar version, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version of Doom was developed by Logicware and published by Art Data Interactive on April 26, 1996.Retaining most of the limitations of the Jaguar version (adding the Spectre enemy back in), the 3DO version runs at a low framerate with a heavily-bordered screen. The screen size can be increased with a cheat code, but it severely limits the framerate (at times making it near-unplayable). There is no multiplayer support.Unique to this version is a CD-quality arranged soundtrack, performed by an unknown band hired by ADI.The source code for this port was released by its sole developer in late 2014.Windows 95Bill Gates at a Microsoft event in 1995Known as WinDoom or Doom95, developed for Windows, unveiled in 1995 and released in 1996, this port capitalized on the popularity of Doom and was used by Microsoft to showcase their new DirectX technology. It supports screen resolutions up to 640x480 and features a GUI launcher allowing easy selection of episode, map, difficulty, custom wads, and multiplayer settings.Sega SaturnBased on the PlayStation version, the Sega Saturn version of Doom was developed by Rage and published by GT Interactive on March 26, 1997.Much of the additions from the PlayStation port's engine (such as colored lighting, translucency, and animated skies) were not included. It also runs at a low framerate (comparable to the 3DO version). Only the European and Japanese releases includes two-player link cable multiplayer (despite the back of the North American box stating that it's supported). Game Boy AdvanceBased on the Jaguar version, the Game Boy Advance version of Doom was developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision on October 26, 2001.Retaining most of the limitations of the Jaguar version, the GBA is known for its game censorship (to reduce its content rating down to 13+) changing all the red blood of enemies to green, having all enemy corpses disappear after a few seconds, and removing all gib effects.All of the Jaguar version's levels are retained, though the game includes an episode selection screen that allows the player to start in a later set of levels. This version also adds between-level game saving with up to four save slots. The game also includes link multiplayer for up to four players (each with their own copy of the game and Link Cables) and eight exclusive maps for deathmatch play.Despite Doom II also receiving a GBA port, it is unrelated to this version as it uses its own custom engine by Torus.XboxThe Xbox port of Doom was developed by Vicarious Visions and was included (alongside Doom II) with both the collector's edition of the Xbox release of Doom 3 (on April 23, 2005) and the Xbox release of Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil (on October 5, 2005), both published by Activision. It is the first official source port based on the official release of the source code.Along with some glitches, the Xbox version is known for its inclusion of split-screen multiplayer (with up to four players), controller-based cheat codes, and a hidden exclusive level ("Sewers", made in 1994 from the lead programmer for the Doom 3 port).This version is not fully backwards-compatible with the Xbox 360.Xbox 360Likely based on the Xbox version above (without the glitches or extra content), the Xbox 360 version of Doom was developed by Nerve and published by Activision digitally for Xbox Live Arcade on September 27, 2006. It is the first official source port that is digitally distributed and the first to be nearly identical to the original game.Some additions to this version include high definition rendering, surround sound support, achievements, online leaderboards, split-screen multiplayer, and online multiplayer (via Xbox Live) for up to four players.Doom II also received an Xbox 360 release (itself featuring a new nine-level episode). Both versions were pulled from the marketplace in 2010 and were re-published by Bethesda in early 2012. Both versions are also backwards-compatible with the Xbox One and were offered as pre-order bonuses for the Xbox One version of the Doom re-boot.PlayStation 3Released in 2012 in a collection called "Doom Classic Complete" which features The Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, Master Levels for Doom 2. This collection also includes the previously exclusive No Rest for the Living bonus episode from the Xbox 360 release of Doom 2. This port features a stripped down version of idtech 5 for networking and other PSN specific code written during the development of RAGE.iPhone / iPod TouchAn official iOS port of Doom, titled Classic Doom, was released by id Software in 2009. The port is based on the source port PrBoom which allows for OpenGL rendering.LinuxThe Linux port of Doom was created by Dave Taylor of id Software and released in 1994. The source code of this port was made available to the public in 1997 and is the basis for all subsequent source ports.Unofficial Source PortsOn December 23 1997, Doom's source code was made available to the public. Thanks to the game's popularity, the active mod-making community, and the support of its fans, this release spawned many new versions of the game engine (known as "source ports") for modern computer platforms that are still active to this day.While some, like Chocolate Doom, maintain the original game's compatibility and look-and-feel, most derived ports (such as Boom, ZDoom, and Zandronum) update the game's engine to add a variety of new features, including optimized online multiplayer, high resolution rendering, removal of the original engine's limitations, additional control options (including jumping, crouching, the ability to look up and down, and swimming), support for numerous scripting languages (including those that allow custom enemies and weapons), support for other id Tech 1 games (such as Heretic, Hexen, and Strife), and new special effects (such as slopes, colored lighting, and 3D floors).In addition to desktop computer platforms, source ports have been created for a variety of homebrew-enabled consoles and handheld devices, including the Sega Dreamcast, Xbox, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo Wii, and Nintendo 64, as well as all iOS and Android devices. Ports have also been made to browsers (most notably in Adobe Flash), Doom 3 (in a playable terminal), and embedded systems (such as ATM machines).All source ports require a valid Doom data file (or IWAD) to run, which can only be found in PC versions of the game. A list of all standard source ports can be found here. A blog featuring esoteric things that can run Doom can be found here.[CR]System Requirements[CR]Minimum System Requirements386sx IBM compatible computerMS-DOS v3.3 or higherVGA (320x200x256) graphics4mb RAMHard Drive - 4.8 MB (Shareware), 12 MB (Mail-order)[CR]Original Release Versions[CR]Shareware VersionIncludes one of the three episodesIncludes network and modem supportMail-order VersionAll shareware featuresIncludes all three episodes (three episodes each with eight levels and a secret level)Includes Plasma rifleIncludes BFG 9000Versionsv0.2 - February 4, 1993 (alpha version)v0.4 - April 2, 1993 (alpha version)v0.5 - May 22, 1993 (alpha version)v1.0 - December 10, 1993 (uses v0.99 engine)v1.1 - December 16, 1993v1.2 - February 17, 1994 (introduced modem support and Nightmare mode)v1.3 - undocumented / never releasedv1.4 - June 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.5 - July 8, 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.6 - August 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.666 - September 1994v1.7 - October 11, 1994v1.7a - November 8, 1994v1.8 - January 23, 1995v1.9 - February 1, 1995 (the final version)Ultimate Doom, released April 1995, used a slightly modified version of the engine however the version number was not updated.On December 23 1997 the Doom source code was released, this code has the version number 1.10Referencing this new version, source port authors (e.g., ZDoom) often began their versions with 1.11On October 4, 1993 an early beta version of the game was made available to journalists. While this version of the game is similar to the final version (unlike the earlier alpha versions) their are still several key differences most notably the BFG9000 which fired 40 quick bursts of plasma gun ammo. This was changed due to the large number of sprites on screen causing the PC to slowdown. Also, this version has a scoring system. The player could gain score by killing enemies and collecting score giving items such as the Demonic Dagger. The scoring system and scoring items did not make it into the final version of the game.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>FIFA International Soccer</title_clean>
			<plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

			<title_clean>FIFA International Soccer</title_clean>
			<plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

			<title_clean>Family Feud</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Family Feud is an adaptation of the TV game show of the same name, in which two families (five members each) must guess the results of a poll with questions like "What food is commonly eaten at breakfast?". If a team correctly guesses all the answers, or correctly guesses one answer after the other family has given an incorrect answer three times, they win the round.These particular versions were all published by GameTek for various systems, but were functionally similar. The first game to be published by GameTek was the 1991 version for the NES, which was developed by Beam Software (which has since been rebranded as Krome Studios Melbourne). The SNES and Genesis versions were released in October 1993, developed by Imagineering Inc and Eurocom Entertainment Software respectively. The 3DO version from 1994 was also developed by Eurocom Entertainment Software -- this version used digitized actors and clips from the show.This Family Feud is not to be confused with the many other games that have had that title, a complete list of which can be found on the Family Feud franchise page.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise was the second offering from the Ron Gilbert (The Secret of Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion) founded Humongous Entertainment. Built around a streamlined version of the SCUMM engine the game was targeted at a young audience. First released in 1993, Fatty Bear is the only Humongous Entertainment protagonist to not appear in any sequels. [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Starring an anthropomorphic teddy bear clad in red overalls. It is up to Fatty Bear to save Kayla's birthday from disaster. Throughout the game the player is charged with gathering ingredients for a cake, catching a rogue puppy, and decorating Kayla's room. Set in and around Kayla's house, Fatty Bear travels all around to find the necessary items. Featuring an early version of Humongous Entertainment's soon-to-be standard path changing feature the game changes slightly each time it is played.[CR]Design/Gameplay[CR]Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise runs on a streamlined version of the SCUMM engine. Instead of having to pick an action to interact with an object the player only needs to point-and-click for the action to be processed. This modified engine makes the game ideal for younger gamers who can't yet read.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Foes of Ali is a 3-D boxing game with ten different boxers to choose from: George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Jimmy Ellis, Bob Foster, Joe Frazier, Sonny Liston, Ken Norton, Leon Spinks, Chuck Wepner and of course the games namesake Muhammad Ali.[CR]There are three modes to choose from: Exhibition where the player can choose any boxer to fight another, or the player can choose any of Ali's historic fights to play, Tournament where a player fights a series of boxers in an 8 man tournament tree to become champion and Career Mode, where the player can only play as Muhammed Ali and fight the other boxers in order as he did in real life.[CR]Players fight opponents with the basic punch moves, jabs, uppercuts and hooks along with defensive moves like blocking and grabbing.  Fatigue is not simulated, but players can slow down their opponents after a series of large successful hits along with bruises, blooded and black eyes.[CR]There are 21 different camera views to choose from, including first-person that will react to their fighters being hit (ex. if a player keeps getting hit in the eyes, the screen will start to blacken, simulating a swollen eye and if they take a hard enough punch they will actually see the game through double vision).  Championship photos of each boxer is also show before a fight and commentary is provided by Tim Gammon.</plot>

			<title_clean>Gex</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gex is a 2-D mascot platformer developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by BMG Interactive Entertainment for the Panasonic 3D0 in 1995. At one point a pack-in game for the ill-fated system, It was later ported to the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC, and spawned two 3-D based sequels for the Playstation and Nintendo 64.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Gex (voiced by comedian Dana Gould) is an anthropomorphic teenage gecko living in Hawaii with his mother and siblings. When his father, a NASA employee, is killed in a space shuttle accident, Gex becomes a shut-in, refusing to do nothing except watch television for hours on end in an attempt to refuse coping with his father's sudden and untimely death. After trying everything in her power to get her son out of the house and away from the television, Gex's mother decides to move the whole family to California.A change of scenery does nothing for Gex, however, and, after a few attempts by both his new neighbors and his family to get him away from the television, Gex's mom gets desperate and gives the TV away to gypsies. Gex soon runs away from home in outrage and befriends some local punk kids, one of which allows Gex to sleep in his garage.Months pass and Gex's mental state deteriorates to the point where he considers an imaginary figure called "The Mayor" as his best friend. While skateboarding with "The Mayor" one day, Gex encounters a black limo, which, come to find out, is now owned by his mother. Another death in the family (this time an uncle, who is noted as being the original model for the Izod clothing company logo) has caused Gex's family to obtain a huge inheritance. Gex uses his share of the funds to move back to Maui, where he buys a mansion, a big-screen TV, and an obscene amount of food so he will never have to leave his house.Of course, this being a 2-D platforming game, something bad is bound to happen that will cause the hero to go on some sort of ridiculous journey, and Gex winds up getting sucked into his new TV thanks to the villainous Rez, who plans on using our brave reptilian hero as the mascot for his hellish Media Dimension, an alternate universe where television fantasy becomes an antagonistic reality.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Gex is your typical mid-90's mascot platforming title. Players must avoid obstacles, collect television remotes, and fight enemies in order to get to the end of the stage. Levels are connected by hub worlds, each with its own television-related theme, and occasional boss battles liven things up every now and then. Gex's main mode of attack was a tail whip, and he could obtain power-ups that let him, among other things, breathe fire and frost-based attacks.[CR]Development[CR]Gex was Crystal Dynamic's attempt to cash in on the anthropomorphic mascot craze of the 90s. Development started with a 5 person team in 1993 as a game about a stunt-gecko named "Gecko X". Each level was themed around a different action move genre and began showing stock footage of a film from the genre. "Gecko X" then had to explore the environment completing stunt tricks in order to obtain money.After a test level was completed using this early concept Lead Programmer "G-Man" expressed discontent with the game's direction and suggested a move to the game's final, more fantasy-themed direction. The character of "Gecko X" was redesigned into his current incarnation as "Gex" and a new villain, "Rez", was created as well. The stunt-gecko idea was also dropped.The team began working on art assets for the game but, due to the power of the 32-bit Panasonic 3DO when compared to the 16-bit consoles the devs had been working on up to that point, development moved slowly for the Gex team. Crystal Dynamics's initial reluctance to add more employees to the team did not help the slow dev process, and it looked unlikely that the game would be ready for its original release date of June 1994. The company eventually hired more artists, however, and even contracted out some of the graphical to work to Silicon Knights, who later became famous for Eternal Darkness for the Nintendo GameCube.June 1994 came and the game was only about halfway done. Levels were either completely redone with tile sets they weren't originally intended to use, or, in the case of a science-fiction themed world, scrapped entirely. Crystal Dynamics hired more employees to help finish the game, but Gex still needed a ton of work in order to stand out amongst the many other mascot platformers that had begun to flood the gaming market. Members of the development team worked 12-16 hour days, hoping to finish the game by Summer 1995. To kill off stress the tile set for the sci-fi levels was resurrected for hidden levels and two secret mini-games were added to the game's code. An 18 minute credit sequence was also created for the game, accessible by beating the hidden sci-fi levels.When the game was almost finished, play testers found a hidden level created by lead designer Justin Knorr that contained the message "Didn't you think this level had some cool shit in it? This level was cut because the company didn't put you, the customer, first but just wanted to make money. Call Madeline Canepa at 415-555-1212 and give her a piece of your mind and my mind too". The level was cut and Knorr was fired from the company.The game was originally slated to feature rail-shooter-esque levels in addition to the platforming segments, but these were later scrapped.[CR]Ports[CR]With the 3DO performing miserably in the gaming marketplace, Gex wound up being ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn shortly after its original release. The port was published by Crystal Dynamics and did not feature all of the secrets found in the 3DO version. In addition, the 3DO's save game feature was eliminated and passwords, considered a relic of the 16-bit era, were the only way players could continue the game at a later point without losing their progress.A PC port was later published by Microsoft Game Studios after the success of the game on consoles.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Gex for the 3DO soon became the premier 2-D platformer for the system. Its success spawned two sequels, Enter the Gecko and Deep Cover Gecko, for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, both later remade for the Game Boy Color. Despite its two sequels and handheld ports, however, Gex's popularity never reached as high as the Crash Bandicoot's and Spyro the Dragon's of the world. The series did not make an appearance on the last generation of consoles, and, with Crystal Dynamics busy with the Tomb Raider series this generation, it is unlikely that we'll see a new title in the series any time soon.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10Processor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 92 MB available space[CR]Links[CR] GMAN-GAMES: GEX - the game's lead programmer talks at length about the game's development[CR]</plot>

			<plot>In the future, mankind has been enslaved in a virtual reality simulation known as Perfect. This simulation is controlled by an entity known as Perfect1 and it has to be destroyed in order to shut down the system. You are Immercenary Number Five, and it's your job to do it. [CR]From a secret lab you log into the simulation which sends you to a place in Perfect known as the Garden. Every entity in the game has a certain rank that determines its offensive and defensive capabilities. You start at 255, the lowest rank, and must rise in ranks to defeat Perfect1, who holds rank number 1. To do so, you destroy higher-ranked Rithms, as the other entities in the game are called. To pass beyond certain ranks, unique Rithms high in the Perfect hierarchy have to be destroyed.[CR]Different weapons and power-ups can be collected and spent offensive and defensive energy can be recharged at energy spires. In the center of the Garden is a place called DOAsys, which functions as a neutral zone and healing center. There you can talk to other Rithms and ask for hints about combating special Rithms and where to find special items. These dialogue sequences take the form of live action clips of actors in elaborate costumes playing the Rithms.[CR]When the player logs out of the simulation or is violently forced out, he returns to the lab where one may load and save a game and access detailed statistics on the trips to Perfect.</plot>

			<plot>The box for Iron Angel of the Apocalypse describes itself as an "Action Role-Playing Movie."  Apparently this is the phrase used to describe a simple first-person shooter with a lot of live-action cutscenes.[CR]You play a character known as Tetsujin.  You are a cyborg/robot creation of an evil scientist.  The scientist intended to use you to wipe out the human race, but instead you decided to turn against your maker and escape.  The story unfolds as you fight your way to the top of a skyscraper to confront the mad scientist.</plot>

			<title_clean>Iron Angel of the Apocalypse - The Return</title_clean>
			<plot>Tetsujin returns in this sequel to Iron Angel of the Apocalypse. The story picks up shortly after the events of the previous game.  After his showdown with the Scientist and the Android, Tetsujin finds himself disembodied. A mysterious corporation known as SCR gives you a new body, but their plans for your are mysterious.[CR]The format of this game is mostly similar to the first. This is a first person shooter that relies heavily on video cutscenes to tell a story. The graphics engine has been improved greatly, giving this game a much faster pace than it's predecessor. Whereas the original used a combination of live actors and CG, this one uses CG to depict the humans as well.</plot>

			<plot>Based on its namesake film, Jurassic Park Interactive places you as a park security guard and tasks you with guiding five to eleven visitors (based on the skill level you chose) to the safety of the helipad. You select each visitor from an overhead map, and must play one of three randomly-selected minigames to determine if they successfully make it to the next safe house:[CR]- "Spitter Shoot" is a shooting gallery with Dilophosaurs as the targets. You use a stun gun which must be charged up to have maximum effect. Docile dinos also mix with the hostile ones, but turn hostile if shot unnecessarily.[CR]- "T-Rex Chase" is a basic driving game where you must outrun a Tyranosaurus (visible in your rear-view mirror) while simultaneously staying on the road and dodging hazards.[CR]- "Raptor Maze" is a 3D, first-person game where you must escape a darkened building while being stalked by Velociraptors of increasing numbers. You have no weapons, and must instead use gates to block the dinos and alternate pathways to slip by.[CR]You must also hack computer locks to allow you access to the communications systems. Each lock is yet another minigame; these based off of arcade classics (Space Invaders, Asteroids) with dinosaurs and Jurassic Park characters.[CR]Your final rating is given based on your success in both areas.</plot>

You have no weapons, and must instead use gates to block the dinos and alternate pathways to slip by.[CR]You must also hack computer locks to allow you access to the communications systems. Each lock is yet another minigame; these based off of arcade classics (Space Invaders, Asteroids) with dinosaurs and Jurassic Park characters.[CR]Your final rating is given based on your success in both areas.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Killing Time is a single player only, first person shooter from the mid-1990s. It was initially released on the 3DO system by Studio 3DO. Sales were not as high as expected, and so it was released on other formats too. The PC and Mac version were not a port of the 3DO version but remade from scratch.On July 23, 2015, Zoom Platform announced their release of an updated version exclusively for their store. The update work was done by Jordan Freeman Group and published by Zoom LLC and Prism Entertainment.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Tess ConwayMatinicus Island,1932. Tess Conway is a great collector of ancient Egyptian antiquities and she has come into the possession of an ancient Water Clock. With the help of Byron they plan to make use of its rumoured power to satisfy Tess' desire for eternal youth. Duncan becomes suspicious and does not want to be left out. Tess and all her associates disappeared soon after under mysterious circumstances. The player takes the role of an Egyptology student that decides to embark on a journey to the Conway Estate to track down the Water Clock and investigate the disappearances.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]"Help Me".The gameplay is very much in the style of Doom and other shooters of its ilk. The labyrinthine rooms and corridors are traversed in order to collect weapons, ammunition, special items, and keys. The 3DO version has a detailed map system that greatly helps in figuring out where to go next. Unlike Doom, all the areas in this game are interconnected into a continuous exploration of the estate. Cleared areas can be revisited, and sometimes this is necessary in order to get to previously inaccessible areas. The story unfolds in the form of video clips integrated into the environment. A ghostlike blue icon representing the character of Tess indicates where video clips are and they can be played back multiple times at the convenience of the player. The player can stop the playback of a particular clip by just walking away at any time. Sometimes hints and help can be derived from what transpires in a given scene. For example, the seven-year-old girl Angela Conway has a love of riddles. Upon meeting her, she may deliver a riddle that may ultimately help the player's progress.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR].45 Caliber Nickel-Plated Colt "Peacemaker" RevolverDual Revolvers1931 Remington 12 Gauge Pump Model 870 Shotgun1917 Kleinschmidt Flamethrower1928 Thompson .45 Caliber Sub Machine Gun (or "Tommy" Gun)CrowbarMolotov CocktailsAnkh (BFG equivalent)[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Ducks will alert nearby gun-toting Gamekeepers to the player's presence by repeatedly quacking.A lot of the enemies featured in this game are digitised actors in costume, much like the main characters that appear in the cutscenes. There are also many non-human enemies such as ducks, wasps, sewer blobs.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Tess ConwayTess Conway (played by Lise Bruneau).Born in Boston, Tess is well educated and sharp tongued but also vain and impulsive. She is the sole heir to the huge Conway fortune, and resides in the Conway Estate on the island of Matinicus. She has lately become interested in the occult and ancient Egypt and frequently seeks information and advice from Byron. She despises the thought of growing old and would do anything to halt the aging process.Duncan DeVries Duncan DeVries (played by Eric Flom).Born in Baltimore, Duncan is a shallow but ambitious bootlegger. Wherever Duncan goes, trouble is not far behind him. His ambition has lead him to Tess. He wants her wealth and her love. He hopes to charm his way to the Conway fortune. He strings Lydia along making her think he is interested in her but he only uses her for practice. He suspects that Byron and Tess are up to something and he plans to find out, especially if it can benefit him. His only real friend is his Thug sidekick Mike - but he puts his own ambition above any friendship and would sacrifice Mike in a heartbeat if it meant furthering his plans.Lydia TewkesburyLydia Tewkesbury (played by Paula Sonnenberg).Like Tess she was also born in Boston. She went to Radcliffe with Tess and met Byron in Cambridge. Always living in Tess' shadow, she cannot match up to her intellect. Lydia likes to drink too much and is quick to anger. She likes to be the centre of attention, especially when Tess isn't around. She mistakenly thinks Duncan can be wooed away from Tess. She regards the butler, Robert as a favourite uncle. She treats Byron like a brother and makes fun of Mike, flirting with him only for practice.Angela ConwayAngela Conway (played by Ashley Penrod).Seven-year-old Angela was born in Newport Beach, Rhode Island. Tess' niece loves to recite old English riddles taught to her by her grandmother. She is well liked but people tend to forget she's in the room. She knows a lot about the Conway Estate and its mysterious grounds as a result.Byron FlemmingByron Flemming (played by Colin Thomson).Byron is of German descent, but lives in New York. A nervous but amiable fellow, Byron is infatuated with Tess but knows he doesn't have a chance with her. He tries to use his expertise in Egyptology to win Tess' affections. He is very wary but jealous of Duncan and can't understand what Tess sees in him. He tries to impress Lydia with his intellect, but she finds him boring and innocuous. He gets on very well with Robert the butler and considers him a true gentleman.Mike MurphyMike Murphy (played by Tim Flanagan).From Baltimore, Mike was hired by Duncan as a security man. He guards the estate and the various contraband that Duncan brings in. He is under the delusion that Duncan may eventually make him rich. He admires Tess' class but doesn't know what to make of her intellect. He does not like Robert the butler at all, and thinks Byron is a complete wimp. He is attracted to Lydia, but doesn't realise that she has no real interest in him.Robert KenilworthRobert Kenilworth (played by Edward Sarafian).A traditional English butler, he has been in the Conway's service for 20 years. He has helped raise and look after Tess since she was a child, but is distressed with Tess for bringing in shady characters such as Duncan and Mike to the estate. He is very knowledgeable about the estate residents, guests, and history. He likes Lydia and covers for her to keep her out of trouble with Tess. He and Byron hold each other in very high regard and considers Byron a part of the family.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes - The Case of the Serrated Scalpel is a verb-based point-and-click graphic adventure game.[CR]Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot![CR]London, 1888. Sherlock Holmes, the worlds most famous private investigator, and his faithful companion Dr. Watson, are called to the scene of a gruesome crime: a young actress has been murdered in an alley behind her theatre. Not surprisingly, Scotland Yards Inspector Lestrade is clueless. Was it the work of the Ripper? Sherlock Holmes is not so sure -- the circumstantial evidence indicates a much more intricate crime. The shrewd detective begins the hunt.[CR]The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes is a classical crime story with two distinguished, sympathetic protagonists. In the role of Sherlock Holmes, you travel through London in the search for clues. Interesting locations are gradually added to a city map. Your most important source of information are dialogues with suspects, witnesses and other people  and with Dr. Watson, who will readily comment on the situation. When talking to persons, you may chose one of several lines that seems most appropriate. Watson notes down all conversations in his journal, where you can access them if needed. Pleasingly true to the novels, Holmes will solve many puzzles through sharp observations and thorough searches of every location (thus discovering clues and deducing connections) as well as clever interrogations.[CR]The handling of the game by means of verbs is simple and accurate. Readers of the Sherlock Holmes stories will recognize many acquaintances, from Lestrade to Miss Hudson, from Inspector Gregson to Toby the hound. The games introduction, cut-scenes and ending feature digitized speech. [CR]For more information on Sherlock Holmes, see the Trivia and Links sections.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]MegaRace is an MS-DOS PC title by Cryo Interactive released in the early 90s. The player is thrust into the role of a contestant on a game show in which the goal is to battle gangs in an armored, weapon equipped vehicle in dysotopian enivronments.Darkly humorous FMV scenes featuring the show's host, Lance Boyle, helped create the atmosphere of a slightly inhumane, high-stakes game show, but the actual gameplay was not much more than a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone, albeit a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone with pretty pre-rendered graphics. Many Packard Bell multi-media computers of the time came with the game pre-installed to show off the power of the CD-ROM medium, which had just come into vogue with the release of Myst in 1993.The game was ported to the 3DO and Sega CD a few months after its release on PC.A MegaRace Reboot is in the works by the Bernie Stolar headed Firm, ZOOM.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Myst</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Myst is a puzzle adventure game designed by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. It was developed by their company Cyan (later known as Cyan Worlds) and was originally published by Br&#248;derbund in 1993 for Apple Macintosh computers. The game was originally programmed in HyperCard, a hypermedia programming tool available for legacy Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. This tool was capable of producing applications that function similarly to simple HTML webpages.Myst was one of the first games released on CD-ROM and heavily contributed to the format's early success in terms of interactive software. After its release for IBM-compatible PCs in 1994, Myst quickly became the best-selling PC game of all time until The Sims broke its record in 2002. The original game became the basis for a highly-successful media franchise that spawned four direct sequels, several spin-off games and three novels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Myst IslandMyst's gameplay is exclusively point-and-click from a first-person perspective. Players explore the world of Myst by clicking on sections of hundreds of static pre-rendered scenes, and can interact with certain objects in the world by clicking or dragging them with the mouse cursor. Myst's limited animations are videos embedded into these pre-rendered backgrounds, giving players a greater sense of immersion despite the limitations of CPU processing power available for the game's initial release. Because all of the scenes were pre-rendered, the game's artists were able to portray the worlds of Myst as highly-detailed 3D environments, which wouldn't have been possible if the game had instead been rendered in real-time.The player is presented with many puzzles that must be solved in order to progress, some of which are integrated into the environment and may not be immediately apparent as puzzles. There is no explicit violence, no time limit and no threat of death; the world of Myst is serene and designed to immerse players in its atmospheric presentation as they unravel the secrets of the mysterious island at their own pace.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Channelwood AgeMyst begins with an opening cutscene narrated by an unidentified man (later established to be Atrus, one of the franchise's central characters) as he describes his plunge into a black "fissure" full of stars. The man is only able to catch a brief glance at his surroundings before suddenly vanishing, leaving behind a mysterious book that continues its descent through the expanse of stars. He apprehensively speculates about where his book may eventually land before admitting that such conjecture is futile, finally concluding that "perhaps the ending has not yet been written".The player character, known unofficially as "the Stranger," discovers Atrus' lost book. When the Stranger opens the book and touches an animated image on the first page, they find themselves transported to the surreal island of Myst. The Stranger must explore the seemingly-deserted island in search of clues regarding its former inhabitants and their purposes, ideally discovering a way back to their home on Earth in the process.Eventually the Stranger enters a small library containing several books, many of which have been burned and are no longer legible. However, the library also holds two conspicuously-undamaged books - one red, one blue - that each appear to contain a person trapped inside. They are Sirrus and Achenar, a pair of brothers and the sons of Atrus. The books that have imprisoned Sirrus and Achenar are missing several of their pages, causing their animated Linking panels to become obscured by rolling static and making communication very difficult. By restoring the missing pages to both books, each brother's speech becomes clear enough to claim that the other betrayed both Atrus and himself, presenting the Stranger with the dilemma of whom to trust. The Stranger is tasked with finding the brothers' remaining pages in order to progress toward the game's conclusion.Continuing their investigation, the Stranger discovers several additional Linking books hidden throughout Myst Island behind a series of meticulously-constructed puzzles. Each book transports the Stranger to a different world known as an "Age," where they must solve the Age's resident puzzles before returning to Myst Island with either a red or blue page in hand. The Stranger can uncover further clues as to what exactly happened on Myst along the way, including several journals and notes written by Atrus. A recorded holographic message addressed to his wife Catherine mentions Atrus' burned library on Myst, as well as his suspicions that one of his own sons is responsible for its destruction.EndingsStoneship AgeBy returning additional red or blue pages to their respective books on Myst Island, each brother's communications gradually become clearer as they continue to decry the other's treachery. Once the fifth page of either book has been returned, the book's occupant recounts their own vague version of the events leading to Atrus' murder. He also reveals the location of a code book leading to a secret chamber inside the library containing the final red and blue pages. While each brother implores the Stranger to only retrieve their own respective pages, both Sirrus and Achenar warn the Stranger not to touch a certain green book which is also located in the secret chamber. They claim it is yet another prison book created by Atrus, much like the two they are currently trapped inside, and that the player will also be trapped if the green book is opened.The Stranger is thus given three options: return the red page to Sirrus, return the blue page to Achenar, or ignore both brothers' warnings and open the green book. In the end, both brothers prove to be completely untrustworthy; several clues can be found throughout the game's different Ages suggesting that both Sirrus and Achenar became twisted, cruel individuals bent on abusing and exploiting these Ages and their inhabitants. If the player ignores these hints and restores the final page to either the red or blue books, they find themselves sucked into the book as its previous occupant is simultaneously released. Sirrus or Achenar thanks the player before proceeding to gleefully rip pages from their former prison book, thereby trapping the Stranger inside indefinitely.Players that investigate the green book instead are presented with a linking panel displaying an image of Atrus, very much alive and sitting behind a writing desk in an unfamiliar location. He quickly warns the player not to link to "D'ni" (later retconned to be a section of the subterranean D'ni City known as K'veer) before describing how his sons were corrupted by greed and a lust for power, leading the two brothers to trap both Catherine and himself in separate prisons so that they could lord over Atrus' written Ages without restraint. Atrus begs the player to ignore their lies and retrieve the single white page torn from his own damaged linking book so that he can return to Myst Island and deliver justice to his scheming sons.Mechanical AgeLinking to D'ni without the white page causes Atrus to bemoan the Stranger's stupidity and the fact that, without a way out, they will both be trapped there forever. If the player instead locates the hidden page on Myst Island and returns it to Atrus, he will use the page to repair his Myst linking book, stating that he faces a "difficult choice" before linking back to Myst himself. After a few moments, Atrus reappears in D'ni and tells the Stranger "it is done". However, he reveals that his wife Catherine is still trapped and fears that his own long imprisonment may have had a "catastrophic impact" on the world in which she is being held hostage (this is established to be the Age of Riven in the game's sequel). Atrus offers his library on Myst and the exploration of his surviving Ages as a reward to the Stranger for their help; he also mentions that he may require the Stranger's assistance again in the future.After Atrus' speech, players may return to Myst Library via Atrus' linking book. Two large burn marks can now be found where the red and blue books once sat, implying that Atrus has destroyed his sons' prison books permanently.[CR]Ports and Remakes[CR]The game has been remade on the PC twice.

			<title_clean>Myst</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Myst is a puzzle adventure game designed by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. It was developed by their company Cyan (later known as Cyan Worlds) and was originally published by Br&#248;derbund in 1993 for Apple Macintosh computers. The game was originally programmed in HyperCard, a hypermedia programming tool available for legacy Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. This tool was capable of producing applications that function similarly to simple HTML webpages.Myst was one of the first games released on CD-ROM and heavily contributed to the format's early success in terms of interactive software. After its release for IBM-compatible PCs in 1994, Myst quickly became the best-selling PC game of all time until The Sims broke its record in 2002. The original game became the basis for a highly-successful media franchise that spawned four direct sequels, several spin-off games and three novels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Myst IslandMyst's gameplay is exclusively point-and-click from a first-person perspective. Players explore the world of Myst by clicking on sections of hundreds of static pre-rendered scenes, and can interact with certain objects in the world by clicking or dragging them with the mouse cursor. Myst's limited animations are videos embedded into these pre-rendered backgrounds, giving players a greater sense of immersion despite the limitations of CPU processing power available for the game's initial release. Because all of the scenes were pre-rendered, the game's artists were able to portray the worlds of Myst as highly-detailed 3D environments, which wouldn't have been possible if the game had instead been rendered in real-time.The player is presented with many puzzles that must be solved in order to progress, some of which are integrated into the environment and may not be immediately apparent as puzzles. There is no explicit violence, no time limit and no threat of death; the world of Myst is serene and designed to immerse players in its atmospheric presentation as they unravel the secrets of the mysterious island at their own pace.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Channelwood AgeMyst begins with an opening cutscene narrated by an unidentified man (later established to be Atrus, one of the franchise's central characters) as he describes his plunge into a black "fissure" full of stars. The man is only able to catch a brief glance at his surroundings before suddenly vanishing, leaving behind a mysterious book that continues its descent through the expanse of stars. He apprehensively speculates about where his book may eventually land before admitting that such conjecture is futile, finally concluding that "perhaps the ending has not yet been written".The player character, known unofficially as "the Stranger," discovers Atrus' lost book. When the Stranger opens the book and touches an animated image on the first page, they find themselves transported to the surreal island of Myst. The Stranger must explore the seemingly-deserted island in search of clues regarding its former inhabitants and their purposes, ideally discovering a way back to their home on Earth in the process.Eventually the Stranger enters a small library containing several books, many of which have been burned and are no longer legible. However, the library also holds two conspicuously-undamaged books - one red, one blue - that each appear to contain a person trapped inside. They are Sirrus and Achenar, a pair of brothers and the sons of Atrus. The books that have imprisoned Sirrus and Achenar are missing several of their pages, causing their animated Linking panels to become obscured by rolling static and making communication very difficult. By restoring the missing pages to both books, each brother's speech becomes clear enough to claim that the other betrayed both Atrus and himself, presenting the Stranger with the dilemma of whom to trust. The Stranger is tasked with finding the brothers' remaining pages in order to progress toward the game's conclusion.Continuing their investigation, the Stranger discovers several additional Linking books hidden throughout Myst Island behind a series of meticulously-constructed puzzles. Each book transports the Stranger to a different world known as an "Age," where they must solve the Age's resident puzzles before returning to Myst Island with either a red or blue page in hand. The Stranger can uncover further clues as to what exactly happened on Myst along the way, including several journals and notes written by Atrus. A recorded holographic message addressed to his wife Catherine mentions Atrus' burned library on Myst, as well as his suspicions that one of his own sons is responsible for its destruction.EndingsStoneship AgeBy returning additional red or blue pages to their respective books on Myst Island, each brother's communications gradually become clearer as they continue to decry the other's treachery. Once the fifth page of either book has been returned, the book's occupant recounts their own vague version of the events leading to Atrus' murder. He also reveals the location of a code book leading to a secret chamber inside the library containing the final red and blue pages. While each brother implores the Stranger to only retrieve their own respective pages, both Sirrus and Achenar warn the Stranger not to touch a certain green book which is also located in the secret chamber. They claim it is yet another prison book created by Atrus, much like the two they are currently trapped inside, and that the player will also be trapped if the green book is opened.The Stranger is thus given three options: return the red page to Sirrus, return the blue page to Achenar, or ignore both brothers' warnings and open the green book. In the end, both brothers prove to be completely untrustworthy; several clues can be found throughout the game's different Ages suggesting that both Sirrus and Achenar became twisted, cruel individuals bent on abusing and exploiting these Ages and their inhabitants. If the player ignores these hints and restores the final page to either the red or blue books, they find themselves sucked into the book as its previous occupant is simultaneously released. Sirrus or Achenar thanks the player before proceeding to gleefully rip pages from their former prison book, thereby trapping the Stranger inside indefinitely.Players that investigate the green book instead are presented with a linking panel displaying an image of Atrus, very much alive and sitting behind a writing desk in an unfamiliar location. He quickly warns the player not to link to "D'ni" (later retconned to be a section of the subterranean D'ni City known as K'veer) before describing how his sons were corrupted by greed and a lust for power, leading the two brothers to trap both Catherine and himself in separate prisons so that they could lord over Atrus' written Ages without restraint. Atrus begs the player to ignore their lies and retrieve the single white page torn from his own damaged linking book so that he can return to Myst Island and deliver justice to his scheming sons.Mechanical AgeLinking to D'ni without the white page causes Atrus to bemoan the Stranger's stupidity and the fact that, without a way out, they will both be trapped there forever. If the player instead locates the hidden page on Myst Island and returns it to Atrus, he will use the page to repair his Myst linking book, stating that he faces a "difficult choice" before linking back to Myst himself. After a few moments, Atrus reappears in D'ni and tells the Stranger "it is done". However, he reveals that his wife Catherine is still trapped and fears that his own long imprisonment may have had a "catastrophic impact" on the world in which she is being held hostage (this is established to be the Age of Riven in the game's sequel). Atrus offers his library on Myst and the exploration of his surviving Ages as a reward to the Stranger for their help; he also mentions that he may require the Stranger's assistance again in the future.After Atrus' speech, players may return to Myst Library via Atrus' linking book. Two large burn marks can now be found where the red and blue books once sat, implying that Atrus has destroyed his sons' prison books permanently.[CR]Ports and Remakes[CR]The game has been remade on the PC twice.

			<title_clean>Nobunaga no Yabou - Haouden</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nobunaga no Yabou: Haouden ("Nobunaga's Ambition: Tale of the Conquerer") is a strategy-sim from Koei and the fifth in their flagship Nobunaga's Ambition series of Sengoku-era feudal sims. Once again, the player assumes one of a number of daimyos, including Oda Nobunaga himself, and tries to take over the rest of Japan. It was originally released in 1992 for the PC-9801 home computer and ported to various other computers and consoles of the period.Among the tweaks to the gameplay was the addition of castles, which are now the locations that players must conquer in order to take over new territory. Haouden was also the first game in the series to be given an expansion pack, though this pack would not be available to all versions of the game.The game was the first flagship Nobunaga's Ambition game to never receive a US localization. It sits between the fourth game, Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness (Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku) from 1990, and the sixth game, Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki from 1994. [CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Olympic Soccer</title_clean>
			<plot>Olympic Soccer is a soccer game developed by U.S Gold and published by Eidos Interactive in lieu of the 1996 Summer Olympic games held in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The game is split into four main game modes for players to choose from, with standard Exhibition, Arcade, League modes included alongside a simulation of the Olympic competition from Atlanta in 1996.A tally of 32 teams are included in the game, with the 16 teams who qualified for the real life tournament at the Olympics as well as 16 developer selected teams. These range from eventual gold medallists Nigeria, hosts the USA, the un-qualified China and even a faux-England team (as England don't compete in Olympic competition as a single country). Additionally, player names were fake and not licensed for use.Up to four players can play the game through use of the Multitap accessory, with a two player mode being available for players without the eponymous extneral add-on. A computer-controlled demo of the game can be selected via the menu, showing two teams playing against each other without player input.The game features some unique commentary from radio-host Alan Green -- as evidenced by his "Whack!" exclamation when players would shoot -- as well as 18 different camera angles, motioned captured animations and polygonal object modelling in a real time 3D engine.Gameplay contains a few additions that set it apart from other luminaries of the time (Actua Soccer, Kick Off, Adidas Power Soccer), including the ability to alter the flight of a ball in mid-air, allowing for extensive curve, swerve and movement to allude goalkeeping AI. This ability could be classified as a 3D representation of the mechanic found in the popular Sensible Soccer franchise or the Xbox Live Arcade release Fitba, which pays homage to the former.The game also has several notable glitches, for example; if your player runs at a 45 degree angle to the corner of the box and shot, it is almost impossible for the goal keeper to save it, resulting in a goal more often than not. This glitch can be exploited to hang large scores on opponents. Also, shooting at the corner flag can also result in a glitched goal.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>PGA Tour 96</title_clean>
			<plot>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).[CR]The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]wise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</plot>

			<plot>If you've ever thought of what it feels like to be the ball in a pinball machine, playing PaTaank might give you some idea.  Instead of flapping the flippers, the player controls the ball, or in PaTaank, a UFO-shaped puck around the three different tables.  The tables are named Surf Room, Luv Room, and Disaster Room and they are connected to each other via Nexus.  Player can choose to play one room or in the MetaGame mode, all of them in sequence.  Each room has an objective and in the MetaGame mode, player must reach that objective to advance into the next room via the Nexus.[CR]Like any pinball, there are targets, tunnels, blocks, and all sorts of flashing things that increase the score, light up letters, or grant bonus items.  In addition to inertial control of the puck, player can apply thrust, which is limited, and activate magnetos, which are scattered around the room.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The PolicenautsPolicenauts is the spiritual successor to Snatcher, both of which have been designed by Hideo Kojima. It takes place in the year 2040 on Earth and within the space colony orbiting high above it, Beyond Coast. It is similar to a point-and-click adventure game and even features mouse support (this is even suggested within the manual as a better means of control). It also features action sequences where the player must shoot targets onscreen in a gallery-format reminiscent of the approach taken by titles such as Virtua Cop and even its predecessor, Snatcher.It was first relesaed on the NEC-PC9821, a Japanese microcomputer, on July 29, 1994, with both a CD-ROM and an installation floppy disk The cut scenes were rendered with hand-drawn pixels than as compressed animation in the anime-style.Policenauts: Pilot Disk was also released for the 3DO on April 21, 1995, containing a playable demo, an interviews with the voice actors behind what would become the standard edition of the game along with the developers, and an extensive encyclopedia describing the concepts within the title's detailed backstory.The first console version version was released on September 29, 1995, for the 3DO and featured extensive enhancements. CG effects were added in, most notably with the mechs that were used within the game, and hand-drawn animation sequences augmented the cut scenes. This would be considered the standard edition of the game that would later be enhanced for its debut on the PlayStation.When the PlayStation version arrived on January 19, 1996, it would feature further cleanup on both the graphics and the movie footage created for the 3DO release. It would also come on two discs. The Saturn would receive the last version of the game on September 13, 1996. It would arrive on three disks and feature support for the Virtua Gun peripheral.On February 9, 1996, Policenauts: Private Collection was released for the PlayStation with the material from Policenauts: Pilot Disk along with a copy of an earlier script of the game included as a bonus. Everything that had been a part of the Pilot Disk release was made available in this release.Policenauts was re-released under the "Konami the Best" label on September 18, 1997, and then again under the "PSone Books" series on August 7, 2003. It was added to the PlayStation Store's Japanese Game Archives on May 15, 2008, making it available as a downloadable title for the PSP and the PS3.English LocalizationThe Saturn version was expected to be released for American audiences, however it was never released. Hideo Kojima had cited that work had begun on it, but the developers were unable to synchronize the English dialogue with the FMV cut-scenes.However, a fan translation of the game was pursued. Marc Laidlaw and Artemio Urbina worked on a translation of the game during 2007, but could not find a programmer capable of inserting the material. In August, 2008, Something Awful forum member Michael Sawyer began experimenting with different approaches to inserting the text and on August 24, 2009, the patch was released coinciding with Hideo Kojima's 46th birthday.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the year 2013, Jonathan Ingram is a 'Policenaut' - an astronaut with police training - whose duty is to protect Beyond Coast, man's first space colony.While testing a prototype spacesuit, it malfunctions and sends him into deep space where he is presumed dead. Twenty-five years later, Jonathan is discovered alive (thanks to the emergency cryo-sleep module in the space suit which also explains why he also has not aged). With everything that he has known having changed in the last two and a half decades, he attempts to eke out a living by returning to Earth and work as a private detective in Los Angeles.He is visited by his ex-wife (Lorraine) who had believed him to be dead and whom he had never thought to visit on Beyond Coast ever since he was found a few years earlier. The meeting for her is just as awkward, but she has no one else to turn to when her husband (Kenzo Hojyo) disappears. She asks him to investigate the matter and although Jonathan refuses to accept the case at first and Lorraine quietly leaves.However, looking outside of his window, he spies someone suspicious near her car and realizing that something might be wrong, he runs out to the street below his office only to watch as Lorraine's car explodes, killing her. Giving chase to the mysterious saboteur, he manages to shoot him several times but ultimately loses him when he escapes on a motorcycle.Determined to learn the truth behind Lorraine's death, the only clue he has is the fact that she was a citizen on Beyond Coast. Having vowed not to go back into space after his incident, he forces himself to take a flight there to crack the case and confront his past.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Much of the game is played very much like a point-and-click adventure game as the player moves from scene to scene. Everything is seen from first-person with scenes represented as stills allowing the player to move the cursor over them in search of items, clues, or interactive hot-spots such as being able to use a computer or a television to catch up on the latest news.The game uses a mix of mediums from still-images to animated CG effects. Anime-styled FMV is used as a storytelling device for dramatic sequences.The game also incorporates shooting sequences with the player controlling a targeting cursor onscreen. Puzzles, such as uncovering a hidden bomb and then defusing it in a step-by-step process, were only two of the challenges that players were confronted with in the game. Speaking to different characters, hearing their views on different topics, and exploring the environment were every bit as important and added to the entertainment value of the title as well as capturing many of the personalities within it.As is typical of most of Hideo Kojima's work, Policenauts also features a well-developed lexicon of terms, cultural nuances, and philosophical themes that help distinguish its cyberpunk-like world. It also features Meryl Silverburgh who would go on to have a role in Metal Gear Solid and the hero is also notable for his smoking habit.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Policenauts features a wide variety of characters to interact with, each with their own distinctive personalities, hang-ups, andJonathan Ingram - He's one of the five "Original Cops" that formed the first Policenauts on Beyond Coast. He was performing a spacewalk with an experimental EVA suit when things went wrong, sending him into deep space where his emergency cryo-capsule saved his life while stopping him from aging.

			<plot>In a classic Japanese RPG style, Guardian War pits you as guardian golem against the dark forces of Azrael, the Evil Lord.  Your world is infested with monsters and your job is to destroy them.  Along the way you meet other golems that you need to revive so that they can join your quest.  Your ultimate goal is to defeat Azrael.[CR]RPG elements are fairly standard with hit points, magic points, speed, mobility, skills, etc.  Each golem type has specific abilities, for example Priest is strong in Light Magic whereas Archer is strong in arrow attacks.  General movement is done on the World map which is divided into Fields and player is able to see which Fields are occupied by the enemy.  Shops are only accessible on the World map.  Selecting a Field takes the group of golems into a Field map which is presented in pseudo-3D.[CR]Player can freely travel the Field map, finding treasures and other items, periodically bumping into enemy groups.  Battles are fought in turns on the same map, there is no separate battle screen.  Movement is into main compass directions only and the player controls the whole group when travelling.  Only during battle are each group member individually controllable.</plot>

			<title_clean>Primal Rage</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Primal Rage is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994. Players control one of seven giant beasts (who are rendered in stop-motion animation) who must battle each other to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known in the game as "Urth"). Although not as popular as the also-violent Mortal Kombat franchise, the game spawned toys, comic books, and a novel, as well as many ports.A sequel (simply named Primal Rage II) was in development, but was canceled (though some early prototypes have been found). [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack. Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Fatalities (glorified execution moves that can only be performed at the end of the winner's winning round) are also performed in this way. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground (giving back some of the player's health). Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final battle to keep its place as "king of the hill". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish "dinosaur graveyard", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, he can immediately restore his initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues.[CR]Characters [CR] The character select screen with the seven playable characters.The game includes seven playable characters. (Six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) A final boss character was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped. Sauron and Diablo are palette swaps of each other, while Blizzard and Chaos are also palette swaps. (However, Diablo and Chaos are smaller than Sauron and Blizzard in terms of size) Sauron Talon Vertigo (not available in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) Blizzard Chaos Armadon Diablo[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Return Fire</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1995 for the 3DO, Return Fire was a spiritual sequel to Silent Software's 1988 title Fire Power. It was a capture the flag game played with four types of vehicles: tanks, armored support vehicles, helicopters and jeeps. Each side had their own base, which was defended by walls, turrets and soldiers. A player would have to invade the enemy base and find the building holding the flag, destroy it, and return with the jeep to pick up the flag and return it to their base without dying.Each vehicle was used for different purposes. The armored support vehicles were slow but heavily armored and could shoot rockets which did a great amount of damage. Tanks were faster and more agile than ASV's but were less powerful. Helicopters were powerful but had to return to their starting points to refuel or restock on ammo, and could be shot down quickly. Jeeps would be destroyed in one or two hits and were only used for picking up the flag. Jeeps could inflate their tires however, and evade tanks and ASV's over water. The game was one of the more popular games on the 3DO, and was highly associated with the system, along with Out of This World, Gex, Masters of Orion 2 and Fifa Soccer.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The game soundtrack consisted of a number of famous classical pieces. The title screen used Verdi's ' Dies Irae' and is a dramatic orchestral and choral track from his Requiem. 'Ride of the Valyries' by Wagner (as used in the helicopter attack in the movie Apocalypse Now) kicks in when the player takes control of the helicopter. 'Flight of the Bumblebee' by Rimsky-Korsakov stars when driving the jeep and then changes to the 'William Tell Overture' by Rossini when driving with the captured flag, 'Mars' from The Planets by Holst is used when driving the tank . Finally, the Armored Support Vehicle uses Greig's 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' as it's musical accompaniment.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The game was featured in the Pauly Shore film In the Army Now.An add-on pack titled Maps o' Death was released for the 3DO version, that consisted of 100 additional maps for the game.A port of Return Fire was completed for the Sega Saturn, but was not released, even though the game had gone "gold".[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Rise of the Robots</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]At the time of the game's release, people were very impressed by the advanced 3D visuals.Rise of the Robots is a fighting game developed by Mirage Technologies and released on a wide variety of platforms including the SNES and Sega Master System. The game was even released in an arcade cabinet.All of the featured characters are robots, with the exception of the main player character featured on the front cover, who is in fact a cyborg; whenever he is defeated in battle, a brief cutscene is shown of his lifeless body, and as the armour around his face is destroyed, we see a human eye underneath. This style was influenced by several popular movies at the time like Blade Runner and The Terminator.The game had a lot of hype pre-release due to the highly detailed visuals and soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). It was intended to take the gameplay of similar fighting games like Street Fighter II, and mesh it with highly advanced visuals to create a new, more technologically advanced era of fighting games. However, upon release the game failed to live up to expectations; the graphics, visuals, and soundtrack were all well made, but the controls handled terribly and movement felt sluggish. The game was almost universally panned by critics and quickly became known for it's poor controls, repetitive gameplay, and lack of any real substance. Some critics went so far as to claim that the reason the gameplay was so bad, was because so much development time had been spent on making the visuals as advanced as possible, and that the reason the movement and fighting felt so sluggish was because the graphics had to use so much memory and so many frames to even convey something as simple as a straight punch. Aside from the usual commands of punches and kicks, there were only a maximum of two special moves per character, and no real combos to speak of, leading to most battles involving players resorting to using constant flying kicks against their opponent in order to take them down, a strategy seen in much older games like Yie Ar Kung Fu. In addition one of the chief complaints was that players only had one character to chose from in single player mode (Cotton) and that even in multiplayer mode one player always had to play as Cotton.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the year 2043, in the land of Metropolis 4. An extremely large company called Electrocorp has a large amount of control over the world thanks to their technological breakthroughs in the fields of science and medicine, they have amassed a fortune greater than that of any other company or country, and have power over all the energy distribution across the planet. In this world, robots are humans servants and perform virtually every task imaginable, leaving humans to focus on developing more important technology and try to make new scientific breakthroughs. Electrocorp, as the world's leading producer and distributor of robots, has been put under great pressure due to the high demand of the increasing global population and so decide to create a supremely advanced AI which will be able to manage the company effectively and cope with the demand of the people. Thus, the Leader Project is established at the Metropolis 4 sector of the Electrocorp company. The project culminates with the creation of The Supervisor, an incredibly intelligent robot, more advanced than anything Electrocorp has ever built before, with the capacity to learn at an incredibly fast rate, along with being able to absorb knowledge from computer terminals in a matter of seconds, The Supervisor quickly exceeds all expectations of the scientists at Metropolis 4, and seems to have become the perfect robot, easily able to cope with the high levels of demand faced by the company, along with developing new ways to increase productivity and efficiency within Electrocorp. The Supervisor is granted power to control every single robot on the planet whenever it needs to.However, things do not continue to go according to plan, while running general diagnostic checks on The Supervisor at Metropolis 4, the scientists discover some new mysterious lines of data in their results and quickly learn that The Supervisor has been infected with the most advanced computer virus ever seen, the EGO virus. Normally this virus would simply destroy a computer or robot, but the effects seen on The Supervisor are completely unexpected. The Supervisor becomes self-aware, it begins to question why it has been made and why it should continue to do as it has been programmed, The Supervisor then takes on a humanoid female form as it decides to create a gender-specific identity for itself. As the virus continues to disrupt the programming put in place by Electrocorp, The Supervisor decides to disobey all orders from the company and take control of every robot on the planet, transmitting the virus to them electronically and ordering them all to rebel against their human masters, initiating a global cybernetic mutiny. The robots begin to destroy everything around them and chaos spreads across the globe, meanwhile, some scientists and officials trapped inside the plant at Metropolis 4 try to come up with a plan to destroy The Supervisor, there is no way for any of them to access her as she is guarded by an army of destructive robots, and so they decide to contact the cyborg ECO35-2, known affectionately as Coton, a half-robot, half-human creation who has not been affected by the EGO virus thanks to his organic brain, the scientists inform Coton that he is the world's only hope for survival and he must battle his way through Metropolis 4 to The Supervisor and eliminate her. Thus the battle begins, with Coton having to take on all of The Supervisor's powerful robot minions, before eventually reaching her and defeating her humanoid form in combat, thus restoring order to the planet and saving all of it's surviving inhabitants.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ECO35-2 (Coton) - The protagonist of the story and only playable character in the single-player campaign, Coton is a cyborg with a human mind and organs, developed in secret by Electrocorp with a budget equivalent to that of the Leader Project. Despite his enemies often carrying and utilising weapons of some kind, Coton fights using only his fists, he has a thick armour plating covering his humanoid body from head to toe, and has been genetically engineered to be as fast and simultaneously powerful as possible. As stated, he has a human central nervous system and brain, no electrical components have been inserted into his body and so the EGO virus had no effect on him, allowing him to retain autonomy and take orders from the Electrocorp scientists to go after The Supervisor. All of his human organs were cloned from the CEO of Electrocorp, who in turn raised Coton as his own son, thus, when the CEO was slaughtered by rebellious robots in the beginning's of the robot mutiny of Metropolis 4, Coton wanted revenge for the murder of what he believed to be his father, thus giving him extra incentive and motive to pursue The Supervisor and destroy her.His special attacks are as follows:Turbo Head Butt - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Charge - A short range barge attack, useful for getting out of corners.Loader - This is the first of six enemies Coton encounters in his quest to destroy The Supervisor. The loader, as its name suggests, was originally simply a loading droid working in the warehouses of Metropolis 4, its primary duty being to lift and carry heavy objects and load them onto trucks to be dispatched elsewhere. When it became infected with the EGO virus however, this loader became a destructive and lethal force, despite being slow-moving and ill-suited for combat, the loader has powerful attacks thanks to its heavy forked arms. As this is the first enemy in the game, it is slow moving and has poor AI, and can easily be defeated with Coton's superior speed and jumping abilities.The special attack of the Loader:Fork Slash - A mighty horizontal blow in which the Loader swings its fork arms at its opponent, slicing anything that gets in the way.Builder - The second enemy encountered in the game, the builder has the appearance of a large blue robotic gorilla, and acts in a similar fashion, using its superior upper body strength to move along on its knuckles whilst defending its relatively small and weak legs. This enemy is also slow-moving and focuses mainly on defense, forcing Coton to gradually wear it down with a rapid succession of attacks.The special attacks of the Builder:Pile Driver - This is a grab move wherein the Builder picks up Coton, spinning him upside down before slamming him down into the ground.Bomber Jump - With this move, the Builder demonstrates its surprising acrobatic abilities by leaping high into the air and slamming down to the ground, releasing a destructive shockwave upon impact.Crusher - The first relatively fast enemy encountered in the game, the Crusher has an insect like appearance, light thin legs allow for much more rapid movement than either the Loader or the Builder, and its sharp snapping pincers have the potential to do a great deal of damage should anything be caught within their grasp.The special attack of the Crusher:Pincer-Mincer - In this attack the Crusher extends its long arms, if it manages to connect with its opponent, the pincers will slowly crush the life out of them.Military - The first enemy encountered by Coton that has true fighting experience and was genuinely designed for combat, the Military droid appears humanoid in shape, can move almost as fast as Coton, and has powerful punches and kicks. This enemy has a high level of defense and is programmed to be able to quickly adapt to any combat situation, meaning that the AI for this enemy is more advanced than those that preceded it.Special attacks of the Military droid:Catapult Spin - For this attack the Military droid extends its arms and spins towards its opponent, should Coton come into contact with the spinning arms he will incur a great amount of damage.Cyber Slash - Here the Military droid reveals a hidden weapon, an extendable sword protrudes from its arm which it then uses to slash at anything in its path.Sentry - Another droid built for combat. The Sentry is a red, demonic looking robot, much stronger than the Military droid, and standing at 3.5 metres tall, the Sentry poses an intimidating challenge for Coton. The jets on its back allow it to fly for brief periods of time, and there are several in-built weapons upon the Sentry, none of which are actually utilised in game.Special attack of the Sentry:Flying Jet Kick - Here the Sentry makes use of its jetpacks to fly towards its opponent at rapid speed, delivering a destructive kick.The Supervisor - The final enemy in the game and by far the most advanced. The Supervisor appears in a humanoid female form, possessing both incredible speed and power to rival that of Coton, along with the most advanced artificial intelligence known to man, The Supervisor is certainly Coton's most difficult opponent.[CR]Sequel[CR]A sequel to the game, entitled Resurrection: Rise 2, was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC in 1996. It featured several of the characters from the first game, continuing the story of Coton, and once again included music written and performed by Brian May.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Road &amp; Track Presents - Over Drivin'</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Road &amp; Track presents: The Need for Speed is an arcade driving game developed by Electronic Arts Canada, and was released in 1994 for 3DO, DOS, Sega Saturn, and the PlayStation. The game was presented by Road &amp; Track, an automotive magazine. A special edition of this game was released in 1996 for Windows 95 support. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Road &amp; Track featured three different game modes: Race, Time Trial, and Tournament. Players who won tournament mode by finishing top of the standings after racing all of the tracks in succession were awarded with a bonus track and car. Subsequent victories gave the player a mirror mode, and finally a rally mode (all the tracks were dirt).Road &amp; Track also featured police chases. On the three point-to-point tracks, which also featured traffic, players could be ticketed and eventually arrested if they were overtaken by a police car.Vehicle handling was markedly different to that of the real Need for Speed games. Despite the outlandish jumps featured in the tracks, the cars had slower steering responsiveness and more accurately reflected each car's unique handling characteristics in the real world. This can be attributed to the game's relationship with Road &amp; Track, who provided the development team with car handling notes, as well as engine and gear change audio.In keeping with the game's attempt at realism, players could run acceleration and braking tests on the Rusty Springs track. The game also had a replay feature, in which players could choose to view the entire race, or just the highlights, which were usually just the crashes. [CR]Cars[CR]Road &amp; Track had nine cars in total, each with a set color. They were:Lamborghini Diablo VT (Black)Ferrari 512TR (Red)Dodge Viper RT/10 (Blue)Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 (Green)Porsche 911 Carrera (Blue)Toyota Supra (Red)Acura NSX (Silver)Mazda RX-7 FD (Yellow)Warrior (Bonus Car) (Purple) [CR]Tracks[CR]There were seven tracks in the game, each with bonus mirror and rally modes. They were: City (point-to-point)Coastal (point-to-point)Alpine (point-to-point)Rusty Springs (closed circuit)Autumn Valley (closed circuit)Vertigo (closed circuit)Lost Vegas (closed circuit) (bonus track) [CR]Showcase[CR]Road &amp; Track's association with the magazine of the same name led to a very detailed car showcase in which players could view pictures, stats and videos of all the cars, with accompanying audio commentary. This feature was an early staple of the Need for Speed franchise, although subsequent iterations were not as detailed.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Road &amp; Track presents: The Need for Speed is an arcade driving game developed by Electronic Arts Canada, and was released in 1994 for 3DO, DOS, Sega Saturn, and the PlayStation. The game was presented by Road &amp; Track, an automotive magazine. A special edition of this game was released in 1996 for Windows 95 support. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Road &amp; Track featured three different game modes: Race, Time Trial, and Tournament. Players who won tournament mode by finishing top of the standings after racing all of the tracks in succession were awarded with a bonus track and car. Subsequent victories gave the player a mirror mode, and finally a rally mode (all the tracks were dirt).Road &amp; Track also featured police chases. On the three point-to-point tracks, which also featured traffic, players could be ticketed and eventually arrested if they were overtaken by a police car.Vehicle handling was markedly different to that of the real Need for Speed games. Despite the outlandish jumps featured in the tracks, the cars had slower steering responsiveness and more accurately reflected each car's unique handling characteristics in the real world. This can be attributed to the game's relationship with Road &amp; Track, who provided the development team with car handling notes, as well as engine and gear change audio.In keeping with the game's attempt at realism, players could run acceleration and braking tests on the Rusty Springs track. The game also had a replay feature, in which players could choose to view the entire race, or just the highlights, which were usually just the crashes. [CR]Cars[CR]Road &amp; Track had nine cars in total, each with a set color. They were:Lamborghini Diablo VT (Black)Ferrari 512TR (Red)Dodge Viper RT/10 (Blue)Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 (Green)Porsche 911 Carrera (Blue)Toyota Supra (Red)Acura NSX (Silver)Mazda RX-7 FD (Yellow)Warrior (Bonus Car) (Purple) [CR]Tracks[CR]There were seven tracks in the game, each with bonus mirror and rally modes. They were: City (point-to-point)Coastal (point-to-point)Alpine (point-to-point)Rusty Springs (closed circuit)Autumn Valley (closed circuit)Vertigo (closed circuit)Lost Vegas (closed circuit) (bonus track) [CR]Showcase[CR]Road &amp; Track's association with the magazine of the same name led to a very detailed car showcase in which players could view pictures, stats and videos of all the cars, with accompanying audio commentary. This feature was an early staple of the Need for Speed franchise, although subsequent iterations were not as detailed.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Road Rash</title_clean>
			<plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. [CR]There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.[CR]There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.[CR]If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.[CR]The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</plot>

			<title_clean>Samurai Shodown</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR]</plot>

He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Set in the not-too-distant future, humanity has been forced to live in their underground infrastructures for unspecified reasons. Here, bands of "Sewer Jockies" group together and with the use of their armed ships, scour the tunnel systems in order to exterminate the mutated creatures that inhabit the sewers to prevent them from contaminating the above-ground resort area of Solar City.The player assumes the role of a rookie pilot and is joined by a veteran pilot, Ghost, who proceeds to berate the player for the majority of the game, and his robot scout, Catfish, who provides the player with valuable information. Throughout the game, the player receives transmissions from the owner of Solar City, Commissioner Stenchler, who will allow the player into his resort should they kill one million pounds worth of creatures.Meanwhile, a fellow jockey by the name of Falco rides into unsanctioned territory following what she describes as a "crazy looking thing," thinking it will lead her on a secret path to Solar City. Later, this creature provides the route for players as opposed to receiving this information from Catfish.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a rail shooter, the player does not take direct control of the ship, but that of the targeting crosshair in order to shoot the various species as they appear. The player does, however, have limited control of the ship during specific navigation spots. While the directions are always different, there is only one specific route to through the sewer for each time the game is played, as specified by Catfish. Occasionally, Catfish will give the player a series of directions (3, 6, 9 or 12) which must be followed or the game will end. When approaching one of the navigation spots, the player must hold down the A button and press the appropriate direction.[CR]Original Format[CR]Originally filmed and created in 1987, Sewer Shark was one of a few games, including eventual Sega CD hit Night Trap, developed for an interactive video system called Nemo, created by Tom Zito for Hasbro. When Hasbro canceled the Nemo project, Zito purchased the rights for Night Trap and Sewer Shark back from Hasbro with the hope that they would one day see release.Years later, Sony would be developing a CD-based addon for Super Nintendo, dubbed Playstation. In search of pre-existing FMV-based games to port to the new system, members of Sony discovered Sewer Shark and wished to license it for the Nintendo Playstation. In response, Tom Zito founded Digital Pictures and worked to port Sewer Shark and Night Trap to the Nintendo add-on, as well as develop all-new FMV-based games.When Sony's development deal for the Super Nintendo add-on fell apart, Sony struck up a partnership with Sega to release the games for the upcoming Sega Genesis CD add-on, Sega CD, instead. Tom Zito would later express minor disappointment with the change, as the Sega Genesis' limitation of only showing 64 colors on screen at one time severely degraded the video quality over the Super Nintendo, which was capable of displaying up to 256 colors on screen at once.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Soccer Kid</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Soccer Kid is a platformer from UK developer Krisalis Software, released on a multitude of systems in 1993 and 1994. The player, as the eponymous Soccer Kid, must recover the pieces of the World Cup Trophy from across the globe after a botched burglary from a group of space pirates. Soccer Kid uses his soccerball to attack enemies, and is able to control it and send it flying in different directions. If he loses the ball, he can simply summon it back to his feet by holding down the kick button.The title screen for most versions of Soccer Kid would allow the player to change the colors on the uniform Soccer Kid wears in-game to closely match their supported team. For the Super Nintendo version, the player could cycle through shirt and short colors with the shoulder buttons. For the US Super Nintendo release, the game was renamed The Adventures of Kid Kleets. The PAL version had in-game advertising for Golden Grahams cereal. The Japanese Super Famicom version of the game had new art for Soccer Kid, rendering him in a more anime style on the title screen, box art and cutscenes (the sprite remained the same).[CR]Development[CR]The original concept for the game was by Dean Lester when the company wanted to do a Mad Professor Mariarti sequel. Lester later took the same concept to Domark, who released the less successful Marko's Magic Football.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace is Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology.

Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a "miss" into its narrative and continue on.Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the "collection of disjointed scenes" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the "Infanto Ray", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a "Shoot" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to "Energize". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES versionThe SNES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace "Dexter", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR]STORY[CR]You are part of a squad of Terminators sent to cleanse a runaway ship, teeming with Tyranid Genestealers, before it crashes into planet Delvar III. You begin as a recruit, given orders to establish a beachhead in the ship. You quickly realize that seizing control of the ship and diverting its course will not be an easy task, even for the most battle hardened Space Marine.[CR]GAMEPLAY[CR]You begin the game as a raw recruit. Your superiors give you orders and mark way points on your HUD for you to travel to and defend. After a few basic missions, your commanding officers start to get picked off, resulting in rapid field promotions that eventually place you in control of the entire squad. The game then takes on a more strategic element. You are must then place your squad of Terminators in the best possible position to achieve victory. Special classes of Terminator later become available, such as flame thrower units and heavy assault cannon units. The game also offers "virtual training" missions where you can hone your skills and practice game play elements.Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is the sequel to the game Space Hulk. It is also based on the Games Workshop board game Space Hulk, and featured game play similar to the original Space Hulk PC game from 1993. It was revived in 2006 with a release by THQ for mobile phones.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>StarBlade was released in arcades in 1991, developed and published by Namco. The game featured a pod, which was developed by Panasonic, in which the user played inside which had become a growing trend in arcade games. However, the inside of the pod is what StarBlade became famous for. StarBlade used a concave mirror to reflect the image from the screen to the top of the pod. This feature was meant to give a deep space feel and StarBlade was the first video game to ever implement the idea. The pod also featured surround sound with four speakers. The game was played with a large 2-axis 4-button controller that acted as a laser gun. The controller's built in LED lights flashed every time an enemy was destroyed. In contrast, when the player was hit by enemies, the seat would rumble and flashes would temporary blind the player. StarBlade was later ported to the Sega CD and 3DO, obviously without the pod. These versions used full motion video backgrounds with polygonal overlays to approximate the arcade graphics. The Sega CD version features wireframe enemies as opposed to shaded enemies. Two years later, the game was also ported to the PlayStation under the name, StarBlade Alpha. The Playstation version features an additional campaign, hence the changed title.An emulated version of the arcade game is included in Tekken 5 on the Playstation 2 as the loading screen mini-game and as a bonus feature.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>StarBlade was released in arcades in 1991, developed and published by Namco. The game featured a pod, which was developed by Panasonic, in which the user played inside which had become a growing trend in arcade games. However, the inside of the pod is what StarBlade became famous for. StarBlade used a concave mirror to reflect the image from the screen to the top of the pod. This feature was meant to give a deep space feel and StarBlade was the first video game to ever implement the idea. The pod also featured surround sound with four speakers. The game was played with a large 2-axis 4-button controller that acted as a laser gun. The controller's built in LED lights flashed every time an enemy was destroyed. In contrast, when the player was hit by enemies, the seat would rumble and flashes would temporary blind the player. StarBlade was later ported to the Sega CD and 3DO, obviously without the pod. These versions used full motion video backgrounds with polygonal overlays to approximate the arcade graphics. The Sega CD version features wireframe enemies as opposed to shaded enemies. Two years later, the game was also ported to the PlayStation under the name, StarBlade Alpha. The Playstation version features an additional campaign, hence the changed title.An emulated version of the arcade game is included in Tekken 5 on the Playstation 2 as the loading screen mini-game and as a bonus feature.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Grand Master is waiting for you....Super Street Fighter II Turbo (known in Japan as Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge) is a 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and released for the arcades on February 23, 1994.The fifth official iteration of Street Fighter II builds upon Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers by adding new moves (such as the Super Combo, a special powerful technique for all characters that can only be activated after building up the new Super Meter) and an adjustable speed setting (which must be turned on by the operator), allowing players to ramp up the speed up to a level similar to Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting. This also marks the first in the series to remove the bonus mini-games that occurs between every few consecutive matches.Each fighter, along with new moves, also have a variety of changes to their gameplay mechanics (for example, Ken has a wide variety of new kicks) and a new primary color palette (in similar vein to Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting). Players can, however, play as the Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers version of each character (removing the Super Meter, reverting most character changes, and giving the original color palette back) by inputting a special cheat code. The game also includes a new hidden boss, Akuma (known in the Japanese version as Gouki), who is shown in promotional artwork and the game's introduction sequence. Believed to be born out of the Sheng Long hoax, this fighter has a variety of powerful moves (including the ability to throw fireballs in the air) and can only be fought by progressing through the difficult single-player game without continuing under a certain condition (either achieving the high score before reaching M. Bison, or reaching M. Bison in under 25 minutes).Between 1994 and 1996, the game has been ported to the 3DO (published by Panasonic for the U.S. and European regions and published by Capcom for Japan), MS-DOS (ported by Eurocom and published by Gametek), and Amiga (including Amiga CD32, ported by Human Soft and also published by Gametek). Unlike the previous iterations of Street Fighter II, the ports authentically replicate the graphics of the arcade version. The MS-DOS and 3DO versions have remixed music (with the 3DO music having the same remixed music as the FM Towns version of Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers). The game was also ported to the PlayStation and Saturn on November 30, 1997 as part of the Street Fighter Collection compilation and ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on November 14, 2006 as part of the Capcom Classics Collection: Volume 2. The game was also ported to the Dreamcast in Japan as an exclusive mail-order release on December 22, 2000, titled Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service. This port includes an online versus mode, the return of bonus mini-games, and hidden secrets (including two alternate versions of Akuma: Shin Gouki and Tien Gouki).Super Street Fighter II Turbo is the last official iteration for nearly ten years, proceeded by Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition and later by Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Follow the story of an absent-minded young sorceress Lucienne and her gang of misfit monsters, as they try to stop the evil mage Death Shadow from destroying the world.[CR]Luciennes Quest is a game in classic roleplaying genre, but presented in full 3D graphics (and sprite characters) uncommon for the time. The battles are fought in traditional turn-based manner, but allow for more strategy than most classic RPGs. The game places ambient obstacles on the battlefield to block some attack paths, but allows the player to strategically reposition his fighters along the bottom two rows of the map before every turn to take advantage of the terrain.[CR]The game also features a dynamic day/night system which serves little purpose other than changing one of your party members from human into a werewolf and back.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Syndicate is a  cyberpunk  isometric  real-time tactical game developed by  Bullfrog Productions and released in 1993 to critical acclaim. An expansion pack,  Syndicate: American Revolt (1993) and a sequel,  Syndicate Wars (1996), have also been released. On February 22, 2012 a  remake was released by  EA Partners and developed by  Starbreeze Studios.[CR]Backstory[CR]As the world of today slipped into the future, multinational corporations grew in size and profit. They came into positions to own small countries and to exercise direct influence over the world's governments. They practically became the world's governments, undemocratically controlling the lives of people through commerce. These corporations became known as Megacorps.One of the Megacorps, a European one, invented the CHIP. A device that is inserted into the neck and stimulates the brain stem to alter a persons perception of the outside world. The CHIP numbs a person's senses to the misery and squalor around them better than any drug and sold millions around the world. It could convince a user that the sun shone when it was raining and that they were more beautiful than they really were.The CHIP, like some  drugs, also made the user open to  auto-suggestion, allowing them to be manipulated by the Megacorps. The CHIP became a perfect tool for the Megacorps to manipulating the populace and to gain power with. It didn't take long before the Megacorps were corrupted and became crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over the world.And in the year of 2096, the Syndicates have not only upgraded the drug they push, but also the way they fight. Instead of using ordinary thugs, they now use teams of custom-built  cyborg  agents to do their dirty deeds.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role of a young executive in a small European Syndicate. The objective of the game is to spread the Syndicate's control globally.World view screenThe world is divided up into 50 territories. To gain control over a territory, the player must complete a mission in that territory. Missions objectives include the assassination of an important person, the elimination of rival agents or kidnapping. Once a territory has been gained, the player can start to collect taxes within it. The taxed amount can be adjusted, but if raised too high, the population can become rebellious against the Syndicate.The player selects a mission from the World map and can then select and outfit agents with weapons and  cybernetic modifications. Between missions, the player can also research new weapons and modifications. This is necessary if the player is to achieve the ultimate goal of world domination.During a missionIn the missions the player controls up to four agents from a fixed isometric view. This is to reflect the fact that the player's character is sitting in an airship high above the city map. The player tells the CHIP controlled agents where to move and where to fire. They will not react to any event unless the player activates Panic mode. During missions, the player can kill  civilians and destroy many things without consequence.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR] Pistol: Very cheap, but basically worthless. Medium range. Shotgun: Short effective range, but does more damage than the hand gun. Uzi SMG: Fast rate of fire, medium range and comes with plenty of ammunition.Long Range Rifle: Very long range and extremely accurate.Flame Thrower: Devastating, but with a very short range.Mini Gun: Gatling gun with a devastating rate of fire and an incredible range. Laser Gun: Will cut through anyone or anything that gets in it way.Gauss Gun: Portable rocket launcher. Hell yeah.[CR]Special Equipment[CR]Persuadertron: A short range weapon that fires a small dose of chemicals, which will make the target lose all their free will and follow the agent who fired.Access Card: Plastic card that allows some security doors to restricted areas to be opened. Will also identify the agent carrying it as a Police officer to other Police units.Scanner: Scans for possible threats and items in the area.Time Bomb: High powered explosive that will, after a set time period, blow with devastating force.MediKit: Will restore a single agent&#8217;s health completely.Energy Shield: Will, during a very short time span, completely protect the agent against all projectile weapons.[CR]</plot>

It would eventually be ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Atari Jaguar and CD-based systems like the Amiga CD32, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and 3DO. The MS-DOS CD version featured Full Motion Videos of some of the rides.The game was also remade for the Nintendo DS in 2009 by EA Japan and on iOS around the same time.

The player then starts to make a new theme park and the process is repeated.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Trip'd is a falling block puzzle game similar to Puyo Puyo.  Instead of blocks, alien eggs of multiple colors fall down and the player must arrange them in a line of four of the same color in order to dispose of them.  However, if eggs of the same color are arranged into a square, they will hatch and form a giant alien that can instantly end the game for the player.  Players must complete the stage within a certain time limit or prevent the eggs to reach the top of the screen or else their game will end.  They also have the option to either play solo, against the computer or against a friend.</plot>

			<plot>Sometime in the near future, the United States has come under attack by a mysterious threat.  After New York and Los Angeles are destroyed, many Americans have formed an underground resistance to fight off the attackers using a VR Simulator to control their planes to keep their fighters alive.  The player has been recruited and is codenamed "Stalker" to defend the U.S. and bring back peace and order.[CR]There are 15 missions in all, where the player has to complete certain objectives, such as destroy a certain amount of enemies or defend certain targets.  The planes are mostly modern age such as the A-10 Warthog. The player can choose to use either the plane's machine guns or missiles to bring down enemy targets.</plot>

			<title_clean>Virtuoso</title_clean>
			<plot>Virtuoso plays like a first person shooter, very much in the same vein as Id Software's 'Doom'.    The basic plot is that you are playing a 'mega-rockstar' who is hiding in his hotel room from his fans and chooses to escape into a virtual reality.  There are three scenarios to play, 'Mars', 'The Haunted House' and 'Marine'.  Which feature different graphics, maps, sounds and enemies.  The protagonist looks like a typical rocker, with black leather jacket, dark shades and long hair.  The levels are completely flat, with no steps or slopes - as in the original Wolfenstein 3D.  You cannot select a weapon - instead you will always use the most powerful weapon collected so far.  Each weapon has unlimited ammunition.    Although Virtuoso plays like a First Person Shooter, the actual camera angle is more 'over the shoulder' but this is only aesthetic and doesn't affect the otherwise clear FPS game mechanics.   The basic objective of each level is to score as highly as possible before leaving the map. Virtuoso received generally poor critical reviews, reviewers cited the gameplay and lack of long term interest as their reasons.  The graphics, sound effects and in-game music were generally well received, scoring more highly than elements such as gameplay and long term interest.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Grab your clubs and head for the first tee. This golf sim recreates the world famous Hawaiian Waialae Golf Course, noted for lots of bunkers and very fast greens. You can choose your golfer, assign him a caddy, pick your set of clubs and adjust the power, putting, technical, recovery and wind game stats to suit your personal preference. The game offers a practice training mode, a tournament mode and the ability to challenge your friends in a stroke match. Oddly, this game was not sanctioned by the PGA and assumes that the golfer is always male.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title was heavily inspired by the original Mortal Kombat, with their usage of digitized actors and hyper-violent finishers. It is one of the first releases of publishing house Naughty Dog. An arcade version was planned in addition to the 3DO release, with laser disc game company American Laser Games at the helm. Several cabinets were produced, but ALG went under before the cabinets could be put into mass production.The game also featured music by alternative metal band; White Zombie and songs from their 1992 album La Sexorcisto.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In a citadel, high in the Himalayan mountains, powerful warriors, both good &amp; evil, mortal &amp; immortal convene once per century for a great tournament. The prize is an inscription of their history, fighting styles &amp; methods into the "Book of Warriors." This magical book provides the balance for good and evil in the world.This is the last tournament though, because the book has only one empty page left. Whoever wins this tournament will tip the balance in favor of good or evil for all eternity.[CR]</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Malcolm McDowell plays Admiral TolwynWing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger is a space combat simulation game and the second sequel to the original Wing Commander released back in 1990. WC3 was the first in the franchise to use full motion video to tell the story instead of the animated cut-scenes used in the first two games. It is also the first in the series to change from the previous 2D sprite-based graphics to 3D texture-mapped polygonal graphics.The Full Motion Videos were directed by Chris Roberts and featured famous actors such as Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings) and Mark Hamill (Star Wars) in the central role of Colonel Christopher Blair. In between missions, Blair could engage in branching conversations with his fellow wing-mates. These conversations usually affected how that character treats him and/or her as the story proceeds. The game is considered to be one of the first "interactive movie"s and was advertised as such. The FMVs were achieved using green screens with all of the sets being created in post-production. Wing Commander III was the most expensive game to be produced at the time with a budget of $4 million dollars.Previously going by the fan name of "Bluehair" in the first two games, the main character of the series was finally given the name of Christopher Blair. Due to the player being able to choose Blair's callsign, the character's actual callsign of "Maverick" would not be made canon until Wing Commander Prophecy. After every mission briefing, the player has the choice of his wingman for that mission along with his fighter craft and its weapons loadout. As in the first Wing Commander, a majority of your various wingmen could be permanently killed during battle or in certain events during the storyline.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Concordia is a total lossThe game begins with a scene on the Kilrathi planet of Kilrah showing Terran Confederation POWs being executed in front of a cheering audience. The only POW left alive is a character from previous games in the series: Colonel Jeanette "Angel" Deveraux, who due to her veteran status is being granted a "different fate". The scene then cuts to Christopher Blair (Hamill) and James Taggert (Davies) inspecting the downed wreckage of the TCS Concordia on the planet Vespus.After grieving over this total loss and the unknown whereabouts of his lover Angel, Blair is transferred by Admiral Tolwyn (McDowell) to the TCS Victory as Wing Commander.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Confederation PilotsManiac and Blair are known for their constant rivalryColonel Christopher Blair: The main character; he is assigned to the TCS Victory as Wing Commander.

Played by John Rhys-Davies.Colonel Jeanette "Angel" Devereaux: Blair's lover; She is involved in a top-secret operation for General Taggert. Played by Yolanda Jilot.[CR]Multiple Endings[CR]There are several different ways for the game to end:The "Good" EndingThe Funeral Ending - Blair is killed in combat during a mission and a funeral is held for him. The war continues without him playing out his important part.The Captured Ending - Blair is shot down during a mission but ejects only to be "rescued" by the Kilrathi. On board the ship the Crown Prince himself gives him two ways to die: either a honorable death by his own hand or disintegration. Either way, the result is the same: Blair is dead and the war continues without him.The Invasion Ending - The "Bad" Ending. Depending on the player's choices throughout the game and in certain key points, things start to go very badly for the Confederation and the War ends with the Kilrathi invading Earth.The Victory Ending - The "Good" Ending. Depending on the player's choices throughout the game and in certain key points, Blair sets out with an experimental weapon and successfully blows up the Kilrathi homeworld, thus ending the thirty year long war as a hero.[CR]Novelization[CR]A Novelization of the game was written by William R. Forstchen and Andrew Keith and was published in 1995.The NovelizationThe novel added more layers to the story and more depth to the characters. It also changed certain things to create more tension for the plot:Flash is no longer a test pilot for the Excalibur fighter, but is instead from the Locanda system as a replacement from the Home Defense Squadron.Blair fails to save Locanda.Blair chooses Rachel over Flint.[CR]</plot>

			<title_clean>Wolfenstein 3D</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfenstein 3D (often stylized as Wolfenstein 3-D) is a first-person shooter developed by id and released by Apogee (via shareware and mail order) on May 5, 1992 for the PC (running MS-DOS).Loosely inspired by the Castle Wolfenstein series of stealth action games, the game is often cited as the progenitor of the modern first-person shooter genre.Set in World War II, players control Captain William "B.J." Blazkowicz, an Allied spy imprisoned by the Nazi regime while attempting to uncover the plans of the mysterious "Operation Eisenfaust". After overpowering a guard and stealing his Luger P08, B.J. must traverse the depths of the fortified stronghold (known as Castle Wolfenstein) and find a way to escape. The subsequent episodes in the trilogy deal with B.J.'s pursuit against Operation Eisenfaust (which turned out to be the creation of undead Nazi mutants) and B.J.'s infiltration into the bunker of Adolf Hitler.The game was originally released in a three-episode trilogy, with the first episode (dealing with the escape from Castle Wolfenstein) as the widely-released shareware episode. A deluxe add-on could have been bought (either separately or bundled with the original trilogy) that added three more episodes (known as "The Nocturnal Missions"), which serve as the game's prequel (as B.J. must investigate Nazi plans for chemical warfare). Commercial versions of the game (released throughout the years by GT Interactive, Activision, Apogee, and id) contained all six episodes.Over the years, the original MS-DOS game has been ported to a variety of platforms. Early ports (in which major graphical and gameplay differences are common) include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Atari Jaguar, Macintosh computers, the Acorn Archimedes, the 3DO, the Apple IIgs, and the NEC PC-9801. Later ports (near-identical to the original game) were released for the Game Boy Advance, Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), Steam (using DOSBox), and all iOS devices. To commemorate the game's 20th anniversary, Bethesda released a browser-based version of the game (including only the original trilogy). Due to the release of the game's source code in 1995 (a practice id would continue with its later games), various unofficial modifications had been created and various ports have been made for additional platforms (including Linux computers, the Dreamcast, and the Sega 32X).Due to the extensive references to Nazism (including graphics depicting swastikas and the title screen theme depicting the anthem of the Nazi party), the game is in violation of German criminal code and is banned in Germany. Some versions (namely the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version) removed the references while censoring the game's violence (for instance, removing blood and changing attack dogs to mutant rats). Some later ports (namely the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions) removed references to the Red Cross (replacing the "red cross" of medical items with a heart symbol).Wolfenstein 3D was followed by a standalone expansion (and prequel) in 1992, titled Spear of Destiny. id has, since then, been a co-developer with several reboots of the Wolfenstein franchise, including 2001's Return to Castle Wolfenstein, 2008's Wolfenstein RPG, and 2009's Wolfenstein.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The objective of Wolfenstein 3D is simply to navigate a variety of maze-like three-dimensional levels, with the ultimate goal being to find the designated exit point, thereby transporting the player to the next level in the sequence. Along the way, the player must engage in first-person firefights with a variety of opponents in order to ensure their survival, all the while keeping an eye out for new weapons and pickups that restore ammo and health so as to tip the odds in their favour. Many levels incorporate locked doors, which may only be opened once the player has located and picked up the associated Key (either Silver or Gold), and exploration is also encouraged, as secret areas are found in abundance throughout the game. These hidden zones are more often than not tremendously helpful, being filled with health pickups, ammo, weaponry, or in rare cases revealing the entrance to a secret level. The game consists of six episodes comprised of ten levels each, with all episodes culminating in a climactic boss fight. After each level the player is taken to a summary screen where they are rated according to various metrics, including kill count and the percentage of treasures and secrets found in the level.The game includes a number of arcade-like elements, including lives and a scoring system, with points awarded for kills and collecting treasures within levels. The player begins each episode with only three lives, but can be awarded additional lives for every 40,000 points they amass, or for finding 1-Ups, up to a potential maximum of nine lives. Upon death, the player returns to the beginning of the current level with only their starting weapons, the Knife and Pistol, and must replay it from scratch. If the player loses all of their lives, they cannot continue at all, and must instead start from the beginning of the episode with three lives. These systems are somewhat trivialized by Wolfenstein 3D's save game system, however, which allows the player to save the game at any point and reload that save without restrictions. Thus, players are essentially able to use this system to restart an infinite number of times while also minimizing many of the normal penalties associated with death, such as lost progress and stripped weaponry.[CR]Episodes[CR]In Wolfenstein 3D, each episode consists of ten floors (one of which is a secret floor, accessible only by finding a secret elevator exit in a specific level of the episode). In the ninth and final floor, players must face a formidable foe (the episode's "boss") in order to proceed.The Original TrilogyThe first episode, "Escape from Wolfenstein", served as the game's shareware episode, with the remaining two episodes available in mail-order. Commercial versions of the game included all three episodes (as well as The Nocturnal Missions below).Episode 1: "Escape from Wolfenstein" - Sent in on a reconnaissance mission to find plans detailing Operation Eisenfaust, B.J. is captured and imprisoned in the depths of Castle Wolfenstein. After overpowering a guard in his cell and taking his pistol, Blazkowicz must escape from the fortified stronghold to continue his mission. Chief among his concerns is Hans Grosse, the fearsome head guard stationed at Castle Wolfenstein.Episode 2: "Operation: Eisenfaust" - After escaping from Castle Wolfenstein, B.J. continues to investigate reports of Operation: Eisenfaust, only to find out that the Nazis are creating an army of undead mutants deep within Castle Hollehammer. B.J. must now fight his way through hordes of the zombified Nazi soldiers (alongside normal guards) and stop the plan at its source (by eliminating the demented head scientist, Dr. Schabbs).Episode 3: "Die, F&#252;hrer, Die!" - After the downfall of Operation: Eisenfaust, B.J. is sent to infiltrate a heavily fortified underground Nazi bunker deep under the Reichstag, where he must find and eliminate the head of the entire Nazi regime: Adolf Hitler.The Nocturnal MissionsFormerly an add-on trilogy to complement the original game, The Nocturnal Missions serve as a prequel to B.J.'s imprisonment at Castle Wolfenstein. All commercial versions of the game include the trilogy.Episode 4: "A Dark Secret" - Intelligence has uncovered a horrifying Nazi plot to begin large-scale chemical warfare against Allied armies, tied to a chemical weapons manufacturer. B.J. must infiltrate the weapons research facility and hunt down the manufacturer: Dr. Otto Giftmacher.Episode 5: "Trail of the Madman" - With Giftmacher dead and the Nazi supply of chemical weaponry cut off, B.J. must now pursue General Fettgesicht, the man in charge of the Nazis' chemical warfare initiative, as the chemical bombardment has already commenced. Traveling deep within Castle Erlangen, B.J. must find documents which detail the specifics of the coming "Giftkrieg" (Poison War) and discover the location of General Fettgesicht. However, these documents are heavily guarded by soldiers led by fearsome head guard Gretel Grosse.Episode 6: "Confrontation" - After recovering the "Giftkrieg" plans, B.J. determines General Fettgesicht's location: Castle Offenbach. To ensure that the Nazi's chemical warfare is well and truly defeated, B.J. travels to Offenbach personally in order to assassinate Fettgesicht.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The original PC release of Wolfenstein 3D features four weapons: a knife, a pistol, and two automatic weapons. All three of the game's ranged weapons are hitscan, and all three of them use the same ammunition (vaguely referred to as "bullets") with the only difference between them being rate of fire. This makes it very important to monitor ammunition levels and refrain from being too trigger-happy (especially with the ammo-eating Chaingun), since running out of bullets renders the player unable to use any firearms (forcing them into the unenviable position of having to attack ranged opponents with only their knife).All normal hitscan weapons deal a random amount of damage per shot from 0 HP to 16 HP. Close-ranged attacks deal 4x the amount of damage, while long-ranged attacks have a chance to miss (proportional to the distance away from the player). Attacking an enemy when they do not notice the player further doubles the damage for the initial shot.Original WeaponsKnifeKnifeOne of the player's two starting weapons, the Knife is the only melee weapon in the game (and the last case scenario after running out of ammo).Because of its reliance on close-quarters, slow stabbing speed, and low damage output (anywhere from 0 HP to 16 HP a stab), attacking most enemies with the knife is very risky (as gun-wielding enemies can deal greater damage in any range). It can be very useful against Dogs, however, as they die to a single stab.PistolPistolOne of the player's two starting weapons, the Pistol is semi-automatic (requiring players to press the Fire button for each shot). Due to its slow rate-of-fire, it is easily surpassed by the Machine Gun once it is acquired.Machine GunMachine GunNot too difficult to find throughout each floor (especially since it can be retrieved by a fallen SS Officer), the Machine Gun surpasses the Pistol in its rate-of-fire (allowing the player to fire away by holding down the Fire button).Despite being fully-automatic, its steady firing rate allows for easier ammo conservation (in comparison to the ammo-eating Chain Gun below) while being formidable against all but the toughest of enemies.Chain GunChain GunThe very pinnacle of Wolfenstein 3D's ballistic arsenal, the Chain Gun unleashes a torrent of bullets at anything directly in front of the player with double the firing rate of the Machine Gun.While it can take out any modest threat in short order, it can be wasteful as it burns through the player's ammunition at an extremely rapid pace. Despite this flaw, it is useful both against very dangerous groups of enemies and against bosses.Port WeaponsFlamethrowerFlamethrowerThe first projectile weapon of the game (added in most ports), the Flamethrower fires a continuous stream of fire as the Fire button is held down. These clouds of ember can travel through enemies (allowing multiple targets to be hit by each projectile) in a straight line until it reaches a wall. Like the Chain Gun, it has a very high rate-of-fire.Unlike most games with flamethrowers, this version contains no splash damage (making it safe for the player to use recklessly, but not making it more effective against wide groups of enemies) and no continual burn damage.Unlike the original weapons, the Flamethrower has its own ammo source, Fuel, which can only be acquired by picking up Fuel Cans. Since enemies do not drop Fuel Cans, ammunition is more scarce.Rocket LauncherRocket LauncherThe last projectile weapon of the game (added in most ports), the Rocket Launcher fires a powerful missile that can shred through most enemies before hitting a wall (or tougher enemy) and exploding.Unlike most games with rocket launchers, this version contains no splash damage (making it safe for the player to use recklessly, but not making it more effective against wide groups of enemies) and no additional explosion damage.Unlike the original weapons, the Rocket Launcher has its own ammo source, Rockets, which can only be acquired by Rocket Boxes. Since enemies do not drop Rocket Boxes, ammunition is more scarce.[CR]Items[CR]The four primary item types in the game are health restoratives, ammunition, treasure, and keys. Any potential benefits an item might bestow are immediately activated upon pickup, and the item itself is consumed; the exceptions to this rule are Gold and Silver Keys, which remain on the player's person (signified by icons in the status bar) in order to be used on locked doors later on in the level (and are inexplicably removed from the player's inventory upon starting a new level). Players cannot pick up any health items once they reach maximum health capacity (100%) and cannot pick up any ammo items once they reach maximum ammo capacity (99 bullets).HealthBlood Pile  Blood PileIf the player is reduced to 10% or less health, each random pile of blood restores 1% of the player's health.Unavailable in the SNES, Jaguar, Mac, and 3DO ports.Dog FoodDog FoodFound near areas with groups of dogs, each single bowl of dog food restores 4% of the player's health.As dogs are replaced with large mutant rats in the SNES port, bowls of dog food are also replaced by cheese.FoodFoodThe most common health pickup in the game, each single plate of food restores 10% of the player's health.MedkitMedkitFound in low quantities, each first aid kit restores 25% of the player's health.1-Up1-UpOnly found in hidden areas, each 1-Up ball restores the player to maximum health while granting both an extra life and 25 bullets. 1-Ups also count towards the end-of-level Treasure total.In the SNES, Mac, and 3DO ports, 1-Ups do not give any bullets. In the Jaguar port, 1-Ups only restores the player to 200% health.TreasuresPicking up a single piece of treasure in the original version of the game increases the player's score by a certain amount (from 100-5000 points). This is useful for gaining extra lives, as they are found in abundance in special treasure rooms and secret areas.In the SNES, Mac, and 3DO versions of the game, treasure does not add to the player score. Instead, all pieces of treasure increase a special Item counter by one. When the Item counter reaches 50, it resets and the player is given an extra life.In the Jaguar version of the game, all pieces of treasure instead give the player 4% additional health. Unlike other health pickups (other than the 1-Up), the player's health can increase beyond 100% by picking up additional treasures (up to around 200%).CrossCrossEach cross adds 100 points to the player's score.Due to Nintendo of America's censorship of religious iconography for their consoles, the SNES port replaces Crosses with large scepters.ChaliceChalice Each golden chalice adds 500 points to the player's score.ChestChest Each treasure chest adds 1000 points to the player's score.CrownCrown Each crown adds 5000 points to the player's score.MiscellaneousSilver &amp; Gold KeysSilver / Gold KeysBoth silver and gold keys are required to unlock certain doors, which are usually required to reach the exit in each floor. While they are usually located at fixed points within the floor, the Grosse bodyguards also carry a key. All keys are discarded once the player exits a floor.Ammo ClipAmmo ClipEach clip of ammunition found throughout the environment grants the player eight bullets. Clips of ammunition dropped by killing most enemies, however, give only four bullets.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]With very few exceptions, enemies in Wolfenstein 3D are typified by hitscan weaponry, and the potential damage they mete out is based on how close the player is to them when they fire. Due to this mechanic, it is almost always preferable to keep one's distance from foes, as this directly limits how much damage attackers can do (though a similar damage scaling is applied to the player's weapons also). In the original PC release, all normal enemies are composed of eight-sided sprites, while bosses are one-sided sprites that face the player at all times. Many ported versions of Wolfenstein 3D convert normal enemies into one-sided sprites as well, which is far from a simple cosmetic change, as the original game allows the player to sneak up on or bypass many unalerted enemies. Without the additional enemy graphics, this mechanic is simply not present in some version of the game.Standard EnemiesGerman ShepherdGerman Shepherd DogHit Points: 1Point Value: 200 The German Shepherd Dog, or Dog, for short, is perhaps the least intimidating of Wolfenstein 3D's enemies, as it can attack only from melee range and has but a single hit point. The latter fact means that a single hit from any weapon is guaranteed to kill it, while the absence of a ranged attack makes it one of the few foes that can safely be handled with the Knife. It is one of the faster enemies in the game, and is capable of quickly closing the gap between itself and the player, which is particularly dangerous if the player is not yet aware of its presence. Due to censorship, German Shepherds were removed and replaced with Mutated Rats (which behave in the same manner) for the SNES release, and Dog Food health pickups were replaced with Cheese.GuardGuardHit Points: 25Point Value: 100 One of the most prevalent of Wolfenstein 3D's enemy types, Guards inhabit many of the game's levels in fairly large quantities. They have modest hit points, and fire at a fairly slow rate, but nonetheless can be quite dangerous, especially if the player does not immediately notice them. The Knife has some efficacy against Guards, particularly if the player can sneak up one, as continuous jabs can often prevent the Guard from retaliating. Any ranged weapon can also make short work of a Guard, though automatic weaponry is more favorable in instances where Guards appear en masse or with other more dangerous foes. Guards drop Ammo Clips with four bullets upon death.SS OfficerSS OfficerHit Points: 100Point Value: 500 The SS, or Schutzstaffel, are significantly tougher and more deadly than the regular Guards, with fully automatic Machine Guns and four times the hit points. They are introduced fairly early on, and remain one of the most dangerous opponents throughout the entire game. Failing to notice a nearby SS Officer spells certain death for the player more often than not, and when in the presence of other enemies, they are usually the most pressing concern. Due to their high health and rapid rate of fire, fighting a single SS Officer with a Pistol can be a dicey proposition, and fighting multiple SSes head-on without an automatic weapon can be disastrous. Thankfully, all SS Officers drop Machine Guns upon death. The SS also make a cameo appearance in Doom II: Hell on Earth, which contains two secret levels based on the first and last maps of Escape from Wolfenstein.MutantMutantHit Points: 45 (Skill 1), 55 (Skill 2 &amp; 3), 65 (Skill 4)Point Value: 700 The ghastly Mutants are the twisted undead creations of Dr. Schabbs, consisting of reanimated corpses with large semi-automatic rifles protruding directly out of their chests. Ludicrously, they must pup their arms up and down in order to chamber and fire rounds from these rifles. In terms of threat level, Mutants exist somewhere between the standard Guard and the SS Officer, with improvements in regard to hit point totals and firing rate over the former, but slight degradation in both categories when compared to the latter. Unlike most foes, the Mutant has no "wake up" sound upon being alerted, and this silent activation makes it much more likely that it will be able to sneak up on an unsuspecting player. After being defeated, the Mutant drops an ammo clip with four rounds.OfficerOfficerHit Points: 50Point Value: 400 The Officer looks much like a normal Guard clad in a white uniform, a similarity which is further reinforced by his fondness for the Pistol. The main differentiator between the two is the Officer's speed. They are the fastest ranged attack unit in that game, and the second fastest overall (behind the German Shepherd). This quickness not only applies to their foot speed, but also how fast they are on the draw. Officers will fire their weapons with far less hesitation than Guards, and can close the distance to lethal range in surprisingly little time. They are, however, only moderately equipped in terms of hit points, and will fall fairly quickly to most weapons, yielding 4 bullets in the process.Hitler GhostHitler GhostHit Points: 200 (Skill 1), 300 (Skill 2), 400 (Skill 3), 500 (Skill 4)Point Value: 2000 A facsimile of the F&#252;hrer himself, the Hitler Ghost (also known as Robed Hitler or Fake Hitler) is an extremely rare foe found only in the final level of the third episode, where it appears several times. It can be thought of as a mini-boss of sorts, as it has greater hit points than any other standard foe, which scale upward depending on the difficulty setting. This floating opponent carries no traditional armaments, instead unleashing slow-moving balls of fire from a device visible on its mid-chest. It is the only recurring ranged enemy that favors projectiles over hitscan weaponry, and because of this fact, its attacks can actually be dodged if the player is far enough away to manoeuvre around its incoming fire.BossesHans GrosseHans GrosseHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 As the end boss of the first episode of Wolfenstein 3D, and the final obstacle between B.J. Blazkowicz and freedom from imprisonment in the bowels of Castle Wolfenstein, Hans Grosse is exponentially more powerful than any previously-encountered foe. In a trend which repeats itself with later bosses, Hans Grosse is most easily dispatched with the Chain Gun, though with two of his own, it is not advisable to get closer than medium distance when fighting him. Hans has two relatives, Gretel and Trans, who appear respectively as bosses in the later releases of the Nocturnal Missions and Spear of Destiny; chronologically, though, Hans is actually last Grosse to be killed by the player character.Dr. SchabbsDr. SchabbsHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1550 (Skill 3), 2400 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 The twisted mind behind the creation of the Mutants, Dr. Schabbs was the primary target of the player character prior to his capture by the Nazis. After escaping his prison in the first episode, B.J. continues in his quest to track down the evil doctor, eventually confronting him in the final mission of Episode Two. Schabbs attacks in an unorthodox manner by hurling loaded syringes at the player. Presumably, these needles contain the same concoction used by Schabbs to create his undead abominations, as the skin of the player's status bar portrait turns a sickly gray (complemented by red eyes) if killed by one. As killing Schabbs is the primary objective in Episode Two, his death triggers the ending automatically.Hitler's Mech-ArmourAdolf Hitler (powered armour)Hit Points: 800 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 Clad in a full-body suit of mechanical armor, Hitler proves to be well-prepared for any would-be assassins when confronted by Blazkowicz at the end of the third episode. Boasting a total of four mounted Chain Gun emplacements, the F&#252;hrer is fully equipped to tear opponents apart should they venture too close to him. With such a massive size, though, the footfalls of the monstrous Mecha-Hitler are clearly audible, which can be helpful in keeping away from the full brunt of its guns. Once the player manages to whittle down and destroy the armor protecting Hitler, the leader of the Third Reich springs forth from its remains to continue the battle personally...Adolf HitlerAdolf HitlerHit Points: 500 (Skill 1), 700 (Skill 2), 800 (Skill 3), 900 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 Even with his mechanized armor suit destroyed, Hitler is still a considerable threat to B.J. Blazkowicz, and in fact his sheer damage potential is not reduced when compared to his previous form despite the fact that he carries only two Chain Guns to the Mecha-Hitler's four. Though somewhat less durable in the flesh, Hitler receives a tremendous boost in speed (putting him on par with the fleet-footed Officers), which makes him just as troublesome and gives the player less time overall to react to his movements. His ultimate defeat is the primary objective of the original trilogy, and since later episodes were positioned as prequels, Hitler's downfall is canonically the final event in Wolfenstein 3D, but it is just the beginning for the franchise...Otto GiftmacherOtto GiftmacherHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 Dubbed "The Poisonmaker" due to his heinous proclivities, Otto Giftmacher is a creator of chemical weapons for the Third Reich and the first boss encounter in Wolfenstein 3D's Nocturnal Missions. He attacks with a hand-held Rocket Launcher, which behaves more or less like the player's own Rocket Launcher in the port versions of the game. As projectiles, Giftmacher's rockets can be effectively dodged much like Dr. Schabbs syringes, and listening for audio cues can be helpful in this respect, as the Rocket Launcher emits a telltale sound whenever it fires off a rocket. Upon emerging victorious against him, the protagonist discovers that the Nazis' chemical warfare initiative is already well underway.Gretel GrosseGretel GrosseHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 The sibling of one Hans Grosse, Gretel bears more than a passing resemblance to her brother, and even carries a Chain Gun in each hand just like Hans. Situated at the end of Episode Five, Gretel is tasked with safeguarding plans for the Nazis' chemical weapons attacks, and only by defeating her can the player character hope to acquire them in time to stop General Fettgesicht. Her similarity to Hans Grosse is more than skin deep, as, statistically, she is identical to the boss of Episode One both in the properties of her attack and her hit point totals. As with all hitscan weapons in Wolfenstein 3D, Gretel's Chain Guns become deadlier as the player draws closer, so keeping one's distance is paramount.General FettgesichtGeneral FettgesichtHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 The ultimate opponent in Wolfenstein 3D's Nocturnal Missions and the deviant strategist behind the Third Reich's chemical warfare campaign, General Fettgesicht is Blazkowicz's final target in Episode Six, and killing him puts the final nail in the coffin of Nazi Germany's chemical weapons program. Holding a Chain Gun in his left hand and a Rocket Launcher in his right, Fettgesicht has the honor of being the only Wolfenstein 3D boss, indeed the only enemy in the game, bar none, to have two distinct weapon types. Due to his tendency to fire both weapons in tandem, it is generally not advisable to dodge his rockets while returning fire, as the player will most likely take damage from his Chain Gun even when successful.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity, Wolfenstein 3D was ported to a number of different platforms in the years following its initial PC release. While some ports, such as the Game Boy Advance version, were extremely faithful to the original game, others were wildly divergent, changing many aspect of the game, both cosmetic and otherwise. The release of the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D marks the genesis of what many Wolfenstein fans refer to as the "Mac Family" of ports, consisting of several releases which are markedly different from Wolfenstein 3D on the PC, though noticeably similar to one another. Some of the characteristic changes in these versions include the addition of two new weapons (the Flamethrower and the Rocket Launcher), dramatic changes to the format of the campaign as well as the structure of individual levels, and the adoption of content (i.e., textures, items, and enemies) native to Wolfenstein 3D's sequel, Spear of Destiny.Super Nintendo VersionThe SNES port of Wolfenstein 3D replaces Dogs with "Mutated Rats".Because of inherent limitations in system hardware, the SNES release of Wolfenstein 3D features 32x32 wall textures rather than the 64x64 size used on the PC. This version is also well-known for being heavily censored. Not only were overt references to Nazism and most appearances of blood removed from the game, but the game's enemies also no longer speak German, and religious references like the Cross treasure item were removed as well. Finally, the German Shepherd was completely removed from the game, presumably over animal cruelty concerns, and in its place the game features a giant gray Mutated Rat. The floor color in this version was changed from gray to brown, which some have postulated was done to help the game's gray Rat enemies stand out against the floor.The game's status bar was redone for the SNES, with a redrawn player portrait and an "Item" section, which tracks the number of treasures collected. The Flamethrower and the Rocket Launcher are introduced in this port, and all of the existing weapons feature new graphical treatment. The single-player campaign itself is pared down to just 30 missions from the 60 featured on the PC, and while the included levels are based on those found on the PC, they are not completely faithful to the original maps. The game is also presented as a single linear progression of levels rather than being broken up into discreet episodes. Bosses from the Nocturnal Missions do not appear in this campaign, however three Spear of Destiny bosses (Trans Grosse, the Ubermutant, and the Death Knight) are incorporated, as are new items such as Ammo Boxes, Fuel Cans, and Rocket Boxes.Jaguar VersionWolfenstein 3D on the Jaguar features a greatly minimized HUD.While very similar to the SNES version of the game, Wolfenstein 3D on the Atari Jaguar makes several additional changes. The most immediately noticeable difference is a large leap in graphical fidelity above and beyond even the PC version of the game, using 128x128 wall textures, which are accompanied by new enemy graphics. The Jaguar port remains uncensored, though it does retain the same brown floor coloration of the SNES version. The status bar is removed entirely from the game and replaced with a more minimal heads-up display system, showing only the player's health, ammo, and any keys acquired (as well as B.J.'s portrait to the left). The weapon visuals on the Jaguar are unique to this iteration, and a few of the game's armaments, most notably the Pistol, Chain Gun, and Rocket Launcher, are conspicuously similar in appearance to their counterparts in the Doom series.While the level structure of the Jaguar conforms to the same 30-level campaign seen on the SNES, which includes the new weapons, some of the game's mechanics are changed. Treasure items inexplicably act as a means of health restoration, and though the same four types exist, they all bestow four percentage points of health. Treasure items also have the potential to heal the player above 100% health. The Atari Wolfenstein port was also unique for having different enemy sets for each of its four difficulty levels; in most other versions that have four difficulty settings, the bottom settings share identical enemy placement.3DO VersionClassic gray floors make their return in Wolfenstein 3D for the 3DO.The 3DO release of Wolfenstein 3D takes after the Atari Jaguar, featuring many of the same graphical upgrades and the increased 128x128 texture size over the PC. It also reverts to the classic grey floor colour of the original Wolfenstein 3D while using the weapon graphics introduced in the SNES version. One of the more striking aspect of the 3DO version, however, is its audio presentation. The sound effects and music were redone in a higher fidelity for the port, making it one of the best-sounding ports of Wolfenstein 3D overall. In addition to the weapon graphics, the status bar of the SNES version was also adopted on the 3DO, as were the altered treasure mechanics which tabulate the raw number of treasures collected rather than assigning a point value to the different types.Like all games in the "Mac Family," the 3DO port features a 30-mission adaptation of the original Wolfenstein campaign commonly referred to as the Second Encounter. Unlike previous ports, though, the 3DO also presents the player with a six-episode Third Encounter, which is more directly analogous to the format and composition of the original Wolfenstein 3D levels. The Third Encounter levels are not one-to-one recreations, though, and furthermore incorporate weapons and items not present at the time of the PC version's creation, but on the whole they are far more accurate representations of the original levels than the maps presented in Second Encounter, which are loose approximations.Macintosh VersionThe Macintosh port of Wolfenstein 3D is most similar to the 3DO version, incorporating higher resolution graphics and offering the chance to play both the Second and Third Encounter. A demo version of the Mac port was also disseminated, called First Encounter, which allows the player to fight up to the game's first boss fight with Hans Grosse much like the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D on the PC does. Since this demo is based on the Second Encounter rather than id's original episodes, however, this includes only three levels, whereas the PC shareware release placed Hans Grosse at the end of a full ten-level episode.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]MinimumIBM-PC and CompatiblesMS-DOS(R) 5.0 or higher640K RAM3 MB available Hard Disk Space386/33 MHz ProcessorVGA graphicsJoystick and mouse optionalSupports Sound Blaster and 100% compatible sound cards[CR]</plot>
