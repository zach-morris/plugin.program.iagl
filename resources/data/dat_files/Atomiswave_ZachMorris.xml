		<emu_comment>The Atomiswave is a custom arcade system board and cabinet from Sammy Corporation. It is based on Sega's NAOMI system board (thus it's common to see the "Sega" logo on its boot up screen). The Atomiswave uses interchangeable game cartridges and the cabinets control panel can be easily switched out with different control sets, including dual joysticks, dual lightguns and a steering wheel.[CR]With the retirement of the aging Neo Geo MVS system, SNK Playmore chose the Atomiswave as its next system to develop games for. In a contract with Sammy, SNK Playmore agreed to develop five games for the Atomiswave system.</emu_comment>

		<plot>Animal Basket (Hustle Tamaire Kyousou) mimics a game traditionally played at Japanese sports festivals.  In this game, the furry competitors fight over a single ball.  The goal is attached to another animal, adding to the challenge by having a moving target.  One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively.</plot>

		<plot>Dolphin Blue is a bit of an oddity. Developed and published by Sammy for their Atomiswave hardware, its a run-n-gun arcade game released in 2003, at a time when run-n-guns were mostly out of the mainstream. It's also very obviously inspired by Metal Slug, which was, not coincidentally, the only other run-and-gun series that was still on the marketplace at this point. You play as one of two characters - Eiro, an arms dealer who is looking for some action, or Ann, a soldier who is out to protect the local kingdom. Each of them also have their own pet dolphins, which are blue and pink, respectively. The game is set in the future, and a major incident has transformed what used to be a peaceful nation into a troubled land of waste and ruin, damaging the Earths surface and immersing most everything underwater. The heroes have to protect the Earths remains from an evil empire that wants to take over the world, and rescue a princess figure in the process. The premise was almost definitely inspired by Waterworld, a movie released a decade earlier.</plot>

		<plot>When the humans created artificial beings named "gears" in 22th century, they didn't expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner. Guilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.</plot>
